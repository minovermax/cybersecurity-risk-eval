{"cik": "937098", "company": "TRINET GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBelow is a discussion of the risks that we believe are significant to our business. These risks are not the only ones we face. We may face additional risks that we do not currently consider to be significant or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. You should carefully consider these risks along with the other information provided in this Form 10-K, including the information in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as the information under the heading \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic, health and business disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic slowdown and, while there have been signs of economic recovery in 2021, the pandemic continues to disrupt our business and the businesses of our SMB clients. We cannot predict or control all of these disruptions, and any such disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of the COVID-19 related risks below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the duration and scope of the pandemic (including the emergence of new variants), the impact of the pandemic on the national and global economy, the duration of the economic downturn, government response to the pandemic and our ability to support laws and programs intended to help SMBs, and whether our clients' businesses will contract or fail due to the pandemic. Any of these factors could exacerbate the risks and uncertainties identified below.\nActual and potential impact on clients and prospects\nThe change in the economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse economic impact on our clients and potential clients. We have seen, and expect to continue to see, affected businesses freeze headcount, furlough and terminate employees, and partially or completely shut down business operations. Impacted businesses have faced and we expect many will continue to face liquidity issues, reduced budgets, or an inability to pay for our services or the same level of our services. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our new sales growth declined and we experienced higher WSE attrition than prior periods. See the risk factor titled \u201cOur clients are particularly affected by volatility in the financial and economic environment, which could harm our business\u201d below for more details.\nActual and potential impact on insurance costs\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed how and when our WSEs incur health expenses. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience higher than normal volatility and variability in the amounts that we pay for group health insurance expenses incurred by WSEs within our deductible layer under our risk-based health insurance policies.\nFor example, during the third quarter of 2021, we saw increased constraints on access to medical services and systems, particularly in regions that saw increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations. These constraints reduced preventative and elective procedures, resulting in a decrease in our MCT, defined as changes in participant use of services, including the introduction of new treatment options, changes in treatment guidelines and mandates, and changes in the mix, unit cost and timing of services provided to plan participants. This decrease resulted in a lower than normal Insurance Cost Ratio during that period.\nIt is difficult to predict the rate at which the use of medical services will change as new variants emerge and individual, provider network and government reactions to those variants change. COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccination costs also make it more difficult to predict future health claims costs, and actual claims patterns and cost trends may differ significantly from our historical experience. Because we assume the risk of variability in future health claims costs for our enrollees under our risk-based health insurance policies, this unpredictability could result in higher-than-expected insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we set our benefit services fees for health and welfare benefits in advance for a fixed benefit period, if actual MCT exceeds our projections, this would result in a higher Insurance Cost Ratio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For details on how the volume and\nTRINET 16\n2021 FORM 10-K\nseverity of insurance claims and MCT impact our insurance costs, refer to Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates in Part II, Item 7. MD&A and the risk factor titled \u201cUnexpected changes in workers\u2019 compensation and health insurance costs and claims by worksite employees could harm our business\u201d below.\nIn response to COVID-19, many states have adopted standards intended to extend workers\u2019 compensation coverage to claims based on a diagnosis of COVID-19. Most states have focused on providing coverage for first responders, frontline healthcare workers and other essential workers. We are responsible for the deductible layer under our workers\u2019 compensation policies, and our insurance costs are affected by our WSEs' workers\u2019 compensation insurance claims experience. Any law or legal standard that increases the number of covered workers\u2019 compensation claims under our insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our insurance costs and financial condition. See the risk factor titled \u201cUnexpected changes in workers\u2019 compensation and health insurance costs and claims by worksite employees could harm our business\u201d below for more details.\nActual and potential impact of the laws affecting our industry and clients\nNew laws and programs have been enacted, and may continue to be enacted, at every level of government to help the economy, employers and employees. For example, the 2020 FFCRA and CARES Act and the 2021 PPPFA and ARPA, and subsequent agency guidance related to those acts, created the paycheck protection program (PPP), mandatory employee leave requirements, payroll tax deferral and tax credit programs, COBRA premium assistance facilitated via employer payroll tax credits, and other employment- and employment tax-related incentives. SMBs must rely on PEOs to help take advantage of these programs, and new and amended laws adding programs or changing existing programs may be passed at the federal, state, and local level at any time.\nMost of these laws and programs have not been, and we do not anticipate will be, enacted with the PEO industry in mind. As a result, we cannot guarantee we will be able to support any of these laws and programs in a timely and cost effective manner or at all, which could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of our services and/or affect the ability of our clients and WSEs to fully realize the benefits of these laws and programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the risk factor titled \u201cOur business is subject to numerous complex laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could negatively affect our business\u201d below for more details.\nOperational Risks\nUnexpected changes in workers' compensation and health insurance costs and claims by worksite employees could harm our business.\nOur insurance costs, which comprise a significant portion of our overall costs, are significantly affected by our WSEs\u2019 health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience. Our insurance plans are provided by third-party insurance carriers under risk-based or under guaranteed-cost insurance policies. Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these policies.\nUnder our risk-based health insurance policies, we assume the risk of variability in future health claims costs for our enrollees. We have experienced variability, and may experience variability in the future, in the amounts that we are required to pay for group health insurance expenses incurred by WSEs within our deductible layer under these risk-based policies, based on changing trends in the volume and severity of medical and pharmaceutical claims. This variability arises from changes to the components of MCT. These trends change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop, which makes it difficult for us to predict this aspect of our business and our failure to accurately predict these trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder our fully-insured workers' compensation insurance policies, we assume the risk for losses up to $1 million per claim occurrence (deductible layer). Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these policies. The ultimate cost of the workers\u2019 compensation services provided will not be known until all the claims are settled. If we do not accurately predict the risks that we assume, we may not charge adequate fees to cover our costs, which could reduce our net income and result in a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to predict these costs is limited by unexpected increases in frequency or severity of claims, which can vary due to changes in the cost of treatments or claim settlements.\nWe accrue for the estimated future costs of reimbursing our workers' compensation and health insurance carriers under our insurance policies, using external actuaries and our own experience to develop the estimates, but the volume and severity of claims activity is inherently unpredictable. Estimating these accrued costs requires us to consider a number of factors and requires significant judgment and if our estimates are wrong, that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTRINET 17\n2021 FORM 10-K\nIf we subsequently receive updated information indicating that the volume and severity of insurance claims were higher or lower than previously estimated and reported, our insurance costs could be higher or lower, respectively, in that period or subsequent periods as we adjust our accrued costs accordingly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced both favorable and unfavorable insurance cost variability due to claims activity in the past and could have similar or worse experiences in the future. Refer to Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates in Part II, Item 7. MD&A, of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these estimates.\nOur co-employment relationship with our worksite employees exposes us to unique business risks.\nWe are the co-employer of our WSEs. As the co-employer of our WSEs, we assume some of the risks and obligations of an employer. For instance, we may need to provide access to health benefits to our WSEs even if the cost of providing benefits exceeds the service fees received from our clients. The extent of our responsibility for other aspects of our co-employer relationship with our WSEs remains subject to regulatory uncertainty at the federal, state and local levels. For example, under certain circumstances, we may be responsible for paying salaries, wages and related payroll taxes of our WSEs, even if our clients have not timely remitted payments to us.\nOur WSEs work in our clients' workplaces. Our ability to control the workplace environment of our clients is limited. Yet, we may be subject to liability for violations of labor and employment laws, workers' compensation laws, industry-specific laws that apply to the businesses our clients operate, and other laws that apply to our clients or to employers generally. We may also be liable for acts, omissions or violations by our clients or WSEs, even if we do not participate in such acts, omissions or violations.\nWe seek to mitigate these risks through agreements and insurance coverage and by requiring certain clients to pre-fund certain obligations. Our agreements with our clients divide responsibilities between us and our clients and provide that our clients will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or our WSEs' conduct. However, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect on these obligations. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage, including workers\u2019 compensation and EPLI coverage, to limit our and our clients' exposure to various WSE-related claims. Subject to split by contract, we are still responsible for any deductible layer under such insurance and such insurance generally excludes coverage for claims relating to the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, other wage and hour issues, and employment contract disputes. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us and for which we are unable to obtain indemnification from our clients.\nNegative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us or our corporate employees as a result of the actions of our clients and WSEs, or others associated with them, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. In addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including creating challenges in retaining clients or attracting new clients and hiring and retaining employees.\nIn addition, federal and state positions regarding co-employment relationships can change, and have frequently changed in the past, with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any particular future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. Any such changes could increase our potential liability for the risks outlined above, or otherwise reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of using a PEO, or significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost to provide our services, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur SMB clients are particularly affected by volatility in the economic environment.\nOur clients are small and medium-size businesses that we believe are particularly susceptible to changes in the level of overall economic activity in the markets in which they operate. These businesses are often exposed to credit and cash liquidity risks that larger businesses may be able to avoid, and during periods of weak economic conditions, small business failures tend to increase and employment levels tend to decrease. During these periods, our clients have in the past and may in the future reduce employee headcount, compensation and/or benefits levels, which could negatively affect our revenues and margins if we are unable to reduce our operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough. During these periods, we have also seen in the past and expect to see during such periods in the future, clients terminating our services and/or fewer new clients. When our clients leave us or reduce their headcount, we see increases in unemployment and related COBRA claims costs that we may be unable to recover based on the fees established in our client service agreements.\nWe lose clients for many reasons that we cannot control or easily predict and, generally, our clients sign service agreements that they can cancel on short notice.\nTRINET 18\n2021 FORM 10-K\nOur standard client service agreement can generally be canceled by our clients (or us) with 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. We regularly experience client attrition and decreases in new client sales due to a variety of factors that are difficult for us to control or predict, including the overall national economic conditions, client mergers and acquisitions, increases in our administrative and benefit services fees, client business failure and liquidity issues, the effects of competition, and client decisions to administer HR in-house or via a non-PEO solution. If we were to experience WSE or client attrition for any of the above reasons in excess of historic or expected rates, or if we incorrectly estimate the impact of the above factors on WSE or client attrition rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeographic and industry market concentration makes our results of operations vulnerable to regional and industry-specific economic and health factors.\nOur top five markets, California, New York, Florida, Texas and Georgia, accounted for approximately 60% in aggregate of our paid WSEs for the year ended December 31, 2021. If any of those geographic regions suffers a downturn, even if the economy at the national level remains strong, or experience higher than expected medical services utilization, due to regional health issues, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the portion of our business attributable to clients in that region could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, most of our clients operate in a relatively small number of industries, including the technology, professional services, financial services, life sciences and not-for-profit industries. As a result, if any of those specific industries suffers a downturn, even if the economy at the national level remains strong, the portion of our business attributable to clients in that industry could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny failure in our business systems, or in any third-party business systems or service provider that we rely upon, could reduce the quality of our business services, harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nOur business is highly dependent on in-house and third-party data processing centers and systems that rely on the complex integration of numerous hardware and software subsystems to manage a large volume of daily client and WSE transactions, including the processing of employee, payroll and benefits data. We also rely on third-party systems to provide services for our clients and WSEs, including insurance carrier networks and databases that manage the benefits provided to, and claims made by, our clients and WSEs and electronic banking systems and payroll tax systems that transmit payments and data to clients, WSEs and taxing agencies. These centers and systems have been, and could be disrupted by equipment failures, computer server or systems failures, network outages, malicious acts, software errors or defects, vendor performance problems, power failures, natural disasters, terrorist actions or similar events. We have also experienced office closures on the East Coast on multiple occasions over the past few years due to hurricane threats, and in California due to increased wildfire threats in the state. Our offices and data processing centers in these and other locations will continue to face the risk of closure or damage in the future due to climate change.\nAny delay or failure in our business continuity response to these events, or in the response of our third-party service providers, even if only for a short period of time, can have a significant impact on our clients and WSEs. This could cause clients to leave us, result in reduced revenues, increase our liability to our clients and WSEs, any of which could result in a materially adverse effect on our reputation and business. We also rely on enterprise software applications licensed from third parties that are updated from time to time. Any failure of these systems for any reason could delay or prevent us from providing services to our clients, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur client recovery programs have significant costs. These costs will not be recovered if these programs fail to achieve the business goals for which they are designed, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and/or financial condition.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created several programs to assist in the economic recovery of our existing SMB clients and enhance our ability to retain these clients. These programs are designed to promote client loyalty, incentivize client retention, and to differentiate TriNet from its peers in the PEO industry and in other competing HR services industries. However, these programs are also associated with significant costs, and we cannot guarantee that we will recover these costs, or achieve our intended client loyalty, retention and product differentiation goals from these programs.\nIn April 2020, we created our Recovery Credit program. Eligible clients received one-time reductions against fees for future services, accounted for as a discount, to be received over the following 12 months. As a result of the Recovery Credit, we reduced our total revenues by $128 million in 2020 and $17 million in 2021.\nTRINET 19\n2021 FORM 10-K\nIf any of these programs, or any of our future client recovery programs, fails to generate the business impact for which they are designed, for any reason, our financial performance will be negatively affected, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more details on our Recovery Credit program and 2021 Credit Program, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, in this Form 10-K.\nAdverse changes in our insurance coverage, or in our relationships with key insurance carriers, could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain competitive health and workers' compensation coverage options and insurance rates through well-known insurance carriers. If we are unable to maintain competitive insurance rates or obtain popular and desirable coverage plans through well-known insurance carriers, it could affect our ability to attract and retain clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Where we sponsor insurance coverage and we are not responsible for any deductibles, our carriers set the fixed cost of the plan, which may lead to uncompetitive fees. Even where we sponsor insurance under which we are responsible for deductibles, we may not be able to control our costs in a way that would make our fees competitive.\nIn addition, broad adoption of our services in certain geographic regions or industries may make it more difficult for us to obtain competitive health and/or workers' compensation insurance rates due to concentration of clients within a particular region or industry. For example, we have significant concentrations of clients in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Georgia, which account for approximately 60% in aggregate of our paid WSEs for the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss of any one or more of our key insurance vendors in these areas, or our inability to partner with certain vendors that are better-known or more desirable to our clients or potential clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must continue to work to improve our services to meet the expectations of our clients and regulators, or we may lose our clients and materially harm our business.\nIn order to attract and retain clients, we believe that we must compete in our industry effectively on the basis of the value proposition that we deliver to our clients, including client experience and satisfaction, relevance and cost-effectiveness of our benefit plans, vertical market expertise, total price of service, brand awareness and reputation, ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly, access to online and mobile solutions, and human resources subject matter expertise. The expectations of our clients and prospective clients in these areas change over time as a result of many factors outside of our control, such as competition, regulatory and technical changes, and changing trends in the demands employees place on SMB employers. Regulatory changes may also mandate that we make changes to our services or benefit offerings.\nTo satisfy client expectations and regulatory requirements, we must timely and effectively identify, develop, or license appropriate technologies, and incorporate them into the solutions that we provide. New services or upgrades may not be released according to schedule, or may contain defects when released. Difficulties with the performance of our new technologies, or our ability to satisfy changes in regulatory requirements, could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our services, or client claims against us, any of which could materially harm our business. Even if we are capable of satisfying client expectations in these areas, we may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations. We could lose market share if our competitors develop superior products and services or satisfy client or regulatory demands before we are able to do so. If we are unable to satisfy the evolving product and service expectations and regulatory requirements, then we would experience lower client satisfaction, fewer new clients and higher client attrition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other businesses and technologies, which can divert management's attention and create integration risks and other risks for our business.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions of other businesses and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to pursue future acquisitions. On December 23, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire YourPeople, Inc. dba Zenefits. Acquisitions, including the potential acquisition of Zenefits, involve numerous other risks, some of which we have experienced in the past and which we may experience in the future, including:\n\u2022over-valuing and over-paying for businesses and technologies,\n\u2022increased operating costs and unanticipated costs to successfully integrate the clients, WSEs, operations, systems, technologies, services and personnel of the acquired business,\n\u2022establishing or maintaining required internal controls, procedures and policies for the acquired business,\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns,\nTRINET 20\n2021 FORM 10-K\n\u2022litigation resulting from the activities of the acquired business,\n\u2022insufficient revenues, insurance or seller indemnification to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions and unanticipated liabilities of the acquired businesses,\n\u2022entering markets in which we have no prior experience and may not succeed, and\n\u2022potential loss of key employees or key clients of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition or integration of the acquired business.\nWe have experienced increased operating costs to resolve the challenges of prior acquisitions. If we fail to appropriately integrate any acquired business, we may fail to achieve our growth, service enhancement or operational efficiency objectives, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur business and operations have undergone and will continue to undergo significant change as we seek to improve our operational effectiveness and the support, services and products that we provide to our clients. If our clients and prospects do not accept these changes, or if we are unable to effectively manage this change, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have changed our operations and client service processes in recent periods in order to improve our operational effectiveness, and to provide improved client support, services and product options, and we will continue to do so in the future. For example, in 2020, we adopted a new client service engagement support model, called Connect 360, that we believe will benefit our clients and WSEs by providing them with improved support.. Similarly, in 2021, we launched Financial Services Preferred, and a new product, called IOM, that offers clients the option to receive PEO services from TriNet while also obtaining client-sponsored health benefits from a third-party broker that partners with TriNet. We have adopted robust remote work policies and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. These policies and practices may make it more difficult to manage and implement certain program, service and product initiatives for our clients and their WSEs. If our clients and prospects do not accept or value these support programs, services and products, and other similar changes we make in the future, we may lose clients, experience reduced onboarding rates, and see increased operational costs, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, managing these operational and process changes typically requires changes our internal operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures while we simultaneously seek to effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate new corporate employees, retain our existing corporate employees, maintain our corporate culture, effectively execute our business plan, satisfy our existing clients, acquire new clients, and enhance the quality and scope of our services. These activities also require significant operating and capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to manage these operational and process changes effectively, our costs and expenses may increase more than we expect and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nTRINET 21\n2021 FORM 10-K\nIf we are unable to attract, maintain and manage qualified personnel, including our sales force, our business may be harmed.\nTo succeed, we must be able to attract and retain highly motivated and qualified personnel. Competition for skilled employees is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need, our business may suffer. For example, like many businesses we have experienced higher than normal rates of employee turn-over during the COVID-19 pandemic and related \"great resignation\".\nWe have also experienced elevated sales force attrition in the past and may experience it in the future, for a variety of reasons, including due to changes in industry or client focus, compensation structure, third-party competition for sales talent and other factors. Newly hired sales personnel are typically not productive for some period of time following their hiring, which results in increased near-term costs to us relative to their actual sales contributions during this period. If we are unable to effectively train and maintain an adequately seasoned sales force, our revenues likely will not increase at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is competitive, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or improve our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition on a national and regional level from other PEOs, as well as other existing, and potential, companies and industries that service, or may in the future service, client HR needs. Refer to the heading \"Competition\" under Part I, Item 1. Business, above for more details. Our competitors, regardless of industry, may have greater marketing and financial resources than we have, and may be better positioned than we are in certain markets. Increased competition in our industry could result in price reductions or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. We expect that we will continue to experience competitive pricing pressure.\nMoreover, we may not be successful in convincing potential clients that the use of our services is a superior, cost-effective means of satisfying their HR obligations relative to the way in which they currently satisfy these obligations either by themselves or by using the services of our competitors. If we cannot compete effectively against other PEOs or against the alternative means by which companies meet their HR obligations, or if we are unable to convince clients or potential clients of the advantages of our offerings, our market share and business may suffer, resulting in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nData Privacy and Security Risks\nCyber-attacks or other security-related incidents could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to our reputation.\nWe and our third-party service providers and subcontractors collect, store, use, retain, disclose, transfer and otherwise process a significant amount of confidential, sensitive and personal information from and about our actual and potential clients, WSEs and corporate employees, including bank account and social security numbers, tax information, certain PHI, certain health claim information, retirement account information, and payroll data. Maintaining the security and confidentiality of this information is critically important to our clients, WSEs and corporate employees.\nDue to the size and complexity of our technology platform and services, the amount of confidential, sensitive and personal information that we store and the number of clients, WSEs, corporate employees and service providers with access to this information, we and our service providers are potentially vulnerable to a variety of intentional and inadvertent cyber-attacks and other security-related incidents and threats.\nCybersecurity threats can take a variety of forms. Hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our networks and data centers or those of our service providers. Other malicious actors may direct social engineering, phishing, credential stuffing, ransomware, denial or degradation of service attacks and similar types of attacks against any or all of us, our clients and our service providers. Other threats include inadvertent security breaches or theft, misuse or unauthorized access or other improper actions by our employees, clients, WSEs, service providers and other business partners. Cyber-attacks and other security-related incidents are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature.\nAny actual or attempted cyber-attack or other security-related incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operation. Any actual or attempted breach or disclosure of the confidential, sensitive and personal information that we possess about our clients and WSE could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Public perception of, or even inaccurate or unfounded rumors of, any such attacks, incidents, breaches or disclosures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operation.\nTRINET 22\n2021 FORM 10-K\nAny such attacks, incidents, breaches or disclosures could result in material financial liability by\n\u2022resulting in material fines, penalties, orders, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us or our service providers by regulatory authorities, clients and other third parties,\n\u2022requiring us to indemnify clients and other third parties,\n\u2022damaging our reputation,\n\u2022forcing us to incur significant expenses to defend our actions and practices,\n\u2022delaying product and service development plans,\n\u2022resulting in unrelated compliance breaches as a result of system failures or management distraction, and\n\u2022increasing our costs of doing business.\nTriNet does not need to be the target of such attacks, incidents, breaches and disclosures for them to have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, a cybersecurity attack on a key third-party software service provider could disrupt our services or compromise client data entrusted to that service provider. In December 2021, a third party reported a security vulnerability in a commonly used Java-based application that TriNet also uses called \u201cLog4j\u201d. After review, our security team determine that no security compromise had occurred within TriNet\u2019s systems, but this is no guarantee that a vulnerability identified in any other third-party software would not result in a security compromise. Similarly, a security incident involving a client could result in access to TriNet\u2019s systems. Any of these incidents, even if not initially directed at TriNet, could also have a material adverse effect on our business operations, result in liability, fines and penalties or other regulatory sanctions, a loss of confidence in our ability to provide our services, and/or harm our reputation and relationships with current or potential clients.\nWe, our clients and our service providers have been the victims of these types of threats, attacks and security breaches in the past, and we, our clients and our service providers expect to be victims again in the future. Cyber-attacks have disrupted, or resulted in unauthorized access to, our networks, applications, bank accounts, and confidential, sensitive and personal information, or those of our clients or WSEs or service providers, in the past and successful attacks may occur again in the future. We, our service providers and our clients have experienced other security incidents in the past that led to disclosure of the confidential, sensitive or personal information we possess and we and they could experience such incidents in the future. As a result of these incidents, we have in the past reported, and expect to report in the future, data breaches to regulators, affected individuals, clients and other third parties. While we do not believe that any such past events resulted in material expenditures or a material loss of confidential, sensitive or personal information, we cannot guarantee that any future events will not have a material impact on our operations.\nWe expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any potential, attempted, or existing cyber-attacks or other security-related incidents and their consequences. The costs of identifying and remediating any threat, attack, breach, or disclosure, and the costs associated with responding to litigation or regulatory investigations, could also have a material adverse effect on our business and reduce our operating margins. Although we maintain insurance coverage, the amount of our insurance may not cover the costs associated with any security incident, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any security-related incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nTRINET 23\n2021 FORM 10-K\nOur efforts to protect against and to remediate cyber-attacks, other security-related incidents, and data breaches may not succeed and any such event, whether intentional or inadvertent and whether attributable to us or our service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and the price of our common stock.\nWe have implemented policy, procedural, technical, physical, and administrative controls with the aim of protecting our networks, applications, bank accounts, and the confidential, sensitive and personal information entrusted to us, including bank account and social security numbers, tax information, certain medical information, certain health claim information, retirement account information, payroll data and other PHI, from cyber-attacks and other security-related incidents. While we, and our service providers, have security measures and programs in place to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber-attacks, security-related incidents, data breaches and other similar threats, these security measures and programs and our collective efforts may not always succeed. Despite our efforts and those of our service providers, we cannot fully eliminate the possibility of such cyber-attacks, security-related incidents and other threats, whether intentional or inadvertent and whether internal or external and we, our clients or our service providers may not discover a security incident for a significant period of time after the incident occurs.\nIn some cases, we perform risk assessments of our service providers or require them to undertake security measures through contract provisions. However, we do not control our service providers and our ability to monitor their data security is limited, so we cannot ensure the security measures they take will be sufficient to protect our confidential, sensitive and personal information. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for any cyber-attack or other security-related incident attributed to our service providers regarding the information we share with them and any contractual protections we may have from our service providers may not be sufficient to adequately protect us from any such liabilities and losses.\nWe have invested, and plan to continue investing, in resources to protect our information security ecosystem against cyber-attacks, other security-related incidents, and data breaches and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. However, the security protections and strategies that we implement, and the investigation and remediation efforts we undertake, may not be successful. Any security breach, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in the access, public disclosure, loss or theft of our clients', WSEs' and corporate employees\u2019 confidential, sensitive and personal information, which could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in significant reputational damage and subject us to significant lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe must comply with constantly evolving, data privacy and security laws and regulations, which may require substantial costs or changes to our business, and any actual or perceived compliance failure could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to our reputation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to the collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of confidential, sensitive and personal information. Existing laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and new laws and regulations that apply to our business are being introduced at every level of government inside and outside of the United States. For example, all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Canada have enacted data breach notification laws that may require us to notify WSEs, clients, corporate employees, or other third parties and regulators in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential, sensitive or personal information experienced by us or our service providers.\nTRINET 24\n2021 FORM 10-K\nIn addition to breach notification laws, we have seen increased focus at every level of government inside and outside of the United States on regulating the collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of confidential, sensitive and personal information. For example, in recent years, many states have proposed or enacted new laws or amended existing laws. Certain state laws, including the CCPA and CPRA, may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts, requiring attention to changing regulatory requirements. We believe that we currently comply with the requirements of the CCPA, but additional provisions of the CCPA became effective in 2021 and will become effective in 2023. In 2021 the CCPA went into effect and imposed certain obligations on businesses, such as a requirement to respond to consumer data access requests. We evaluated our obligations under CCPA and ensured necessary compliance. The CPRA, which goes into effect in 2023, may impose additional obligations on us. While we are working to comply with these provisions, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur significant costs or that our efforts will be successful. As a sponsor of employee benefit plans with access to certain PHI, we are subject to regulation at the federal level, including under the HIPAA and the HITECH Act. HIPAA contains restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI and there are penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Additionally, in 2021 the U.S. Department of Labor issued cybersecurity best-practices guidance for sponsors, administrators, service providers and participants of defined contribution retirement plans, which guidance is relevant to the retirement plans we maintain for our corporate employees and worksite employees.\nFor details regarding these data privacy and security laws and regulations discussed above and that apply to our operations, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business, of this Form 10-K, under the heading \"The Laws and Regulations that affect Our Business: Data Privacy and Security Regulations\". Complying with these and any other data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations, and with any new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and restrict the way products and services involving data are offered, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs to comply with the CCPA and other similar regulations. Despite our efforts, in the future we may be unable to make required changes and modifications to our business practices in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all. Given the rapid development of cybersecurity and data privacy laws, we expect to encounter inconsistent interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations, as well as frequent changes to these laws and regulations. As a result, we may be required to incur significant, unexpected compliance costs and we may be exposed to significant penalties or liability for non-compliance, the possibility of fines, lawsuits (including class action privacy litigation), regulatory investigations, criminal or civil sanctions, audits, adverse media coverage, public censure, other claims, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Any inability, or the perception of any inability, to adequately address data privacy or security-related concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our relationships with clients and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to numerous complex laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could negatively affect our business.\nThe services we provide to our clients are subject to numerous complex federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those described in Part I, Item 1. Business, of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations cover a diverse range of topics, including employer status, employee and independent contractor classifications, employee benefits, health and retirement plans, workers' compensation, employment and payroll tax, worksite safety, insurance and banking, wage and hour, anti-discrimination, and many topics specific to the industries of our clients. Many of these laws do not specifically address PEOs or co-employment relationships, and regulators are often unfamiliar with the PEO industry and co-employment relationships, which can lead to unpredictable application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels in relation to our business.\nAny new laws, changes in existing laws, or any adverse application, interpretation or enforcement of new or existing laws, including those described in Part I, Item 1. Business, of this Form 10-K, whether they apply to employers generally or specifically to PEOs or to our co-employment relationships could:\n\u2022reduce or eliminate the value and benefits that clients realize by using our services,\n\u2022change or eliminate the types of services we provide,\n\u2022require us to make significant changes to how we do business and provide services,\nTRINET 25\n2021 FORM 10-K\n\u2022require us to modify our current business practices or operations,\n\u2022affect the extent and type of employee benefits that employers and co-employers can or must provide employees,\n\u2022alter the amount, timing and type of taxes employers, co-employers, clients and WSEs are required to pay and that we must manage for and collect from our clients,\n\u2022increase the cost and complexity of the licensing requirements for our business operations,\n\u2022create or increase our liability and responsibilities to our clients and WSEs, and/or\n\u2022mandate new compliance requirements, disclosures or services.\nAny of the above changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, we have seen a growing trend, particularly at the federal level, of using payroll tax credits, deferrals and other related payroll tax programs as a mechanism for incentivizing SMB development and/or economic recovery. These programs are popular because they allow SMBs, which often have income tax losses, to realize benefits via payroll tax reductions, rather than income tax reductions. However, these programs have generally not been designed with the PEO industry in mind and rely on calculations contained in client income tax returns (which PEOs do not process in their role as the co-employer) and/or other client data that cannot be verified by a PEO, even though the resulting tax benefits are processed through the PEO\u2019s payroll tax returns. Because minimal guidance exists in the statutes that create these programs, they are subject to broad agency interpretation and confusion. In addition, the processes used to evaluate payroll tax filings are designed with individual taxpayers in mind, not PEOs that aggregate the filings of many clients, which can further increase agency confusion and make it difficult to predict agency interpretations.\nExamples of these programs include the 2015 PATH Act, which allows SMBs to use research and development tax credits submitted on the SMB\u2019s income tax return to reduce the SMB\u2019s payroll taxes, and the CARES Act and FFCRA Act payroll tax credit and payroll tax deferral programs enacted in 2020 and 2021, which allow SMBs to defer certain payroll tax obligations to a later date or to receive payroll tax credits based on SMB employment practices that are beyond our control. The IRS has taken positions that we and other PEOs, rather than clients, are responsible for client errors and repaying rejected tax credit claims under these and similar programs. While our clients are contractually responsible for repaying us for any rejected credits under these programs, a contract does not guarantee our ability to recover rejected tax credits and any failure to recover rejected tax credits from our clients would increase our operating expenses, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, and the IRS has taken positions that the tax benefits under these programs should be calculated on an aggregate PEO, rather than individual client, basis, which may limit our ability to obtain full tax benefits for our clients under these and similar programs and/or increase our exposure to credit risk if we are not able to recover excess tax credits paid to our clients. We cannot predict how these positions will ultimately be resolved and if they are resolved unfavorably, we may be forced to discontinue supporting some or all of these programs and/or incur tax expenses that we cannot recover from our clients, which could have a material adverse effect our ability to attract and retain SMB clients.\nThese developments, and any other new laws, changes in laws or adverse application or interpretation of laws, including payroll tax incentive programs, could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of our services and our ability to support programs that clients want, provide clients with new and attractive alternatives to our services, significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost to provide our services, require us to make substantial changes to the way in which we operate, or require us to pay client liabilities with no guarantee of subsequent recovery from our clients, and any one of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging laws and regulations governing health insurance and other traditional employee benefits at the federal, state and local level could negatively affect our business.\nChanges to and continued uncertainty regarding the implementation and future of health care reform in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, has the potential to substantially change the health insurance market for SMBs and how such employers provide health insurance to their employees, which could have a materially adverse effect on how we provide our sponsored health benefits to our WSEs, and our ability to attract and retain our clients. In addition, changes at the federal, state and local level to the laws and regulations regarding other traditional employee benefits, such as retirement and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, also have the potential to substantially change the types of benefit programs that are available to SMBs and that we and other PEOs may be\nTRINET 26\n2021 FORM 10-K\nrequired to offer. Our ability to comply with, and adapt our service offerings to take advantage of, any such changes could require significant additional costs, divert management attention, or be prohibitive based on cost, technology or other factors, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.\nIn order to sponsor certain employee benefit plan offerings for WSEs, we must qualify as an employer of WSEs for certain purposes under the Code and ERISA. In addition, our status as the employer for the purposes of ERISA is important for purposes of ERISA\u2019s preemption of certain state laws. The definition of employer under various laws is not uniform, and under both the Code and ERISA the term is defined in part by different facts and circumstances tests.\nGenerally, these tests are designed to evaluate whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee and they provide substantial weight to whether a purported employer has the right to direct and control the details of an individual's work. Some factors that may be considered important under these tests have included the employer\u2019s degree of behavioral control (for example the extent of instructions, training and evaluation of the work), financial control and the economic aspects of the work relationship, the type of relationship, as evidenced by the specific contract, if any, whether employee benefits are provided, whether the work is indefinite in duration or project-based, and whether it is a regular part of the employer\u2019s business. However, a definitive judicial interpretation of \u201cemployer\u201d in the context of PEOs has not been established.\nWe believe that we qualify as the employer of WSEs for the purposes of Sections 3(5) and 3(40) of ERISA and that our health plans are single-employer plans that, as such, are entitled to ERISA\u2019s preemption of the application of state law. The DOL, however, has determined on a facts and circumstances basis that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry do not qualify as common law employers. In addition, the DOL routinely audits employee benefit plan offerings of employers, and these audits can take years to complete. In one routine audit of one of TriNet\u2019s health plans, the DOL has indicated that while it agrees that we are an employer for ERISA purposes, it believes that wherever there is more than one employer of a WSE, no employer may qualify as a single employer for ERISA purposes. This DOL interpretation is contrary to our interpretation of the applicable ERISA facts and circumstances test, and we understand it also is contrary to the position of other national PEOs. We will continue to vigorously defend our position that we are the sole employer of our WSEs for the purposes of Sections 3(5) and 3(40) of ERISA, and therefore that our health plans are single-employer plans entitled to ERISA\u2019s preemption of applicable state laws. While we have no current DOL audit on-going regarding this issue, the DOL\u2019s position remains uncertain, and this issue may arise in future audits of TriNet plans or the plans of other PEOs in our industry. If it were ultimately determined that all health plans sponsored by PEOs are multiple-employer plans and subject to potential regulation at the state level, we would likely adjust our business model and the manner in which we provide employee health benefits to WSEs. Any such adjustment would require significant investment in time, cost and management attention and would have a material impact on our clients and WSEs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSimilarly, to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code, certain employee benefit plans, such as 401(k) retirement plans and cafeteria plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees. All of our 401(k) retirement plans are operated pursuant to guidance provided by the IRS and have received favorable determination letters from the IRS confirming the qualified status of these plans. However, the IRS uses its own complex, multi-factor test to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer. Although we believe that we qualify as an employer of WSEs under the Code, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge our position or continue to provide favorable determination letters. Moreover, the IRS' 401(k) guidance and qualification requirements are not applicable to the operation of our cafeteria plans.\nFurther, if we are not recognized as an employer under the Code, we may be required to change the method by which we report and remit payroll taxes to tax authorities. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTRINET 27\n2021 FORM 10-K\nThe definition of employers, employees and independent contractors is evolving. Changes to the laws and regulations that govern what it means to be an employer or an employee may require us to make significant changes in our operations and may negatively affect our business.\nNational views on employers, employees and independent contractors are changing at a rapid rate, as evidenced by recent federal and state rule changes. In September 2019, California passed AB5, a law that could potentially reclassify client independent contractors as employees. In November 2020, California voter passed Proposition 22, which supersedes AB5 for certain types of contractors. On August 20, 2021, a California state court found that portions of Proposition 22 were unconstitutional and further held that the entirety of Proposition 22 was unenforceable. Changes like these to the rules in any jurisdiction that define when a worker is an employee or independent contractor can increase or decrease the pool of WSEs that we can co-employ and include in our TriNet sponsored benefit plans, which may negatively impact client demand for the services we provide, require us to modify or change how we operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn January 2020, the DOL issued a new rule broadening the definition of joint employer that has been used under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for more than sixty years. In 2022, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) plans to create a new rule for determining whether two businesses are joint employers under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Joint employment is not the same as co-employment, and we do not believe that we are a joint employer under the DOL rule or any future NLRB rule, or that these rule changes impact our status as a co-employer. While the DOL rule has been partially vacated by a district court decision, these changes could still potentially result in increased FLSA joint employment claims, which could divert management attention and cause us to incur additional and potentially material costs to defend.\nThe examples above highlight the impact to our business when regulations regarding the definitions or classification of employers, employees, independent contractors and other groups of workers change. Any such regulatory changes could affect the way in which we provide TriNet-sponsored benefits to our WSEs, the way in which we report and remit payroll taxes to tax authorities, and our legal liability for the actions and inactions of our clients. Any of such regulatory changes could also require us to change the manner in which we operate our business, or provide our services, and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not comply with our regulatory license requirements, or if we are deemed to be operating in various non-PEO licensed industries without the required licenses, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.\nMost states require PEOs to hold a license and we are licensed as a PEO in all states that require such licenses. If we are not able to satisfy existing or future PEO licensing requirements or other applicable regulations in any state, we may be prohibited from doing business in that state, including having any clients within that state.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched a new product, called IOM, that offers clients the option to receive PEO services from TriNet while obtaining client-sponsored health benefits from a third-party broker that partners with TriNet. TriNet does not broker insurance, but we do maintain producer licenses in all 50 states and select U.S. territories. If we are not able to satisfy existing or future producer licensing requirements, or other applicable regulations in any state, we may not be able to operate this program in the same manner, or we may lose the ability to collect certain administrative fees, within that state.\nIn addition, state regulatory authorities generally impose licensing requirements on companies acting as insurance agents or third-party administrators, such as those that handle health or retirement plan funding and claim processing. Other state regulatory authorities impose licensing requirements on companies involved in the transmission of cash, such as banks, and other money transmitters. We do not believe that our current activities require any such licenses, but we and others in our industry have received inquiries from regulatory authorities in the past and could receive them in the future. If regulatory authorities in any state determine that we are acting as an insurance agent, third-party administrator, money transmitter, or as any other regulated industry other than a PEO, we may need to hire additional personnel to manage regulatory compliance and pay annual regulatory fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal and tax proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business. Refer to Note 10 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information about the legal proceedings we are currently involved in and future proceedings that we may face. Current and future legal proceedings may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTRINET 28\n2021 FORM 10-K\nIn addition, the tax authorities in the U.S. regularly examine our tax returns. Refer to Note 13 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our on-going tax examinations and disputes. The ultimate outcome of tax examinations and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of these or other examinations, we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nFinancial and Stock Ownership Risks\nOur results of operations and stock price may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nOur future operating results and stock price are subject to fluctuations and quarterly variations based upon a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the volume and severity of health and workers' compensation insurance claims made by our WSEs, recorded as part of our insurance costs, and the timing of related claims information provided by our insurance carriers,\n\u2022the amount and timing of our insurance premiums and other insurance costs, operating expenses and capital expenditures,\n\u2022the number of our new clients and the number of WSEs employed by each new client,\n\u2022the retention or loss of existing clients, for any reason, including third-party acquisition,\n\u2022a reduction in the number of WSEs employed by existing clients,\n\u2022the timing of client payments and payment defaults by clients,\n\u2022the costs associated with our acquisitions of companies, assets and technologies,\n\u2022any payments or draw downs on our credit facility,\n\u2022any unanticipated expenses, such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments and compliance expenses arising from changes in regulations or regulatory enforcement,\n\u2022any expenses we incur for geographic and service expansion and service enhancements,\n\u2022any changes in laws or adverse interpretation or enforcement of laws, which may require us to change the manner in which we operate and/or increase our regulatory compliance costs,\n\u2022any changes in our effective tax rate,\n\u2022the issuance of common stock or debt to pay for future acquisitions, which could dilute our stockholders or subject us to significant debt service obligations,\n\u2022amortization expense, or the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, associated with past or future acquisitions, and\n\u2022the impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nIn addition, the trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuation in response to a variety of factors, including the factors above and below, many of which are not within our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the overall performance of the equity markets,\n\u2022any trading activity, or a market expectation regarding such activity, by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders,\n\u2022the economy as a whole, and its impact on SMBs and our clients,\n\u2022the performance and market perception of companies that investors believe are similar to us,\n\u2022any significant changes in the liquidity of our common stock, and\n\u2022market acceptance of our performance across non-financial factors, including evolving environmental, social, and governance factors favored by investors and required by regulators.\nTRINET 29\n2021 FORM 10-K\nMany of the above factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and in Part II, Item 7. MD&A, of this Form 10-K. Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of these factors have in the past and could in the future cause us to fail to meet our expectations and the expectations of investors and any industry analysts who cover our shares, which could result in a decline in our share price and reduced liquidity in our shares. In addition, the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our results of operations to vary widely, which could lead to negative impacts on our margins, short-term liquidity, and our ability to retain or attract key personnel, and could cause other unanticipated issues, including a downgrade of our securities by or change in opinion of industry analysts and a related decline in our share price.\nThe terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which would impair our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our business.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us subject to customary exceptions, including restricting our ability to:\n\u2022incur, assume or prepay debt or incur or assume liens,\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock,\n\u2022make loans, investments or acquisitions,\n\u2022enter into sale-leaseback transactions,\n\u2022enter into new lines of business,\n\u2022complete a significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets, and\n\u2022enter into agreements that prohibit the incurrence of liens or the payment by our subsidiaries of dividends and distributions.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions and the other terms and conditions under our credit facility could result in a default, which in turn could result in the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit to us under our credit facility and acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness then outstanding under our credit facility. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt, which could materially harm our business and force us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nAtairos, our largest stockholder, may have significant influence over our Company, and the ownership of capital stock, and thus the voting control, of our Company remains concentrated in our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOn February 1, 2017, an entity affiliated with Atairos Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates, \u201cAtairos\u201d) became our largest stockholder when it acquired the shares of TriNet common stock previously held by General Atlantic. In connection with this transaction, we appointed Michael J. Angelakis, the Chairman and CEO of Atairos, to our board of directors and agreed to nominate Mr. Angelakis or another designee of Atairos reasonably acceptable to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for election at future annual meetings until Atairos\u2019 beneficial ownership falls below 15% of our common stock. As of January 31, 2022, Atairos beneficially owned approximately 33% of our outstanding common stock, and all of our directors, executive officers and their affiliates, including Atairos, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. As a result Atairos, particularly when acting with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, is able to exert substantial influence on all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nTRINET 30\n2021 FORM 10-K", "PERMNO": 14521, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "TNET"}
