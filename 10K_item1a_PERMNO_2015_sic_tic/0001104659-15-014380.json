{"cik": "88121", "company": "SEABOARD CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSeaboard has identified important risks and uncertainties that could affect the results of operations, financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from Seaboard\u2019s historical results of operations, financial condition or business, or those contemplated by forward-looking statements made herein or elsewhere, by, or on behalf of, Seaboard. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors described below.\n(a) General\n(1)\nSeaboard\u2019s Operations are Subject to the General Risks of the Food Industry. The divisions of the business that are in the food products manufacturing industry are subject to the risks posed by:\n\u00b7\nfood spoilage or food contamination;\n\u00b7\nevolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u00b7\nfederal, state, national, provincial and local food processing regulations;\n\u00b7\nconsumer product liability claims;\n\u00b7\nproduct tampering; and\n\u00b7\npublic perception of food production practices.\nIf one or more of these risks were to materialize, Seaboard\u2019s revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and Seaboard\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\n(2)\nInternational Operations Subject Seaboard to Risks That Could Have a Significant Impact on Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard is a diverse agribusiness and transportation company with global operations in several industries. Most of the sales and costs of Seaboard\u2019s divisions are significantly influenced by worldwide fluctuations in commodity prices or changes in foreign political and economic conditions. Accordingly, sales, operating income and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, Seaboard\u2019s international activities pose risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to United States markets. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u00b7\nhyperinflation;\n\u00b7\nheightened customer credit and execution risk;\n\u00b7\ntariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u00b7\ndifferent legal and regulatory structures and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nnegative perception within a foreign country of a United States company doing business in that foreign country;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations for conducting international business such as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations.\n\u00b7\nexpropriation, civil unrest and government instabilities; and\n\u00b7\ninconsistent application or enforcement of local laws, including tax laws.\nSeaboard cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in competing effectively in international markets.\n(3)\nDeterioration of Economic Conditions Could Negatively Impact Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard\u2019s business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our meat products, grains and shipping services, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results. The current national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nimpair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nnegatively impact global demand for protein and grain-based products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\u00b7\ndecrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including pension plan assets; and\n\u00b7\nimpair the financial viability of our insurers.\n(4)\nOcean Transportation Has Inherent Risks. Seaboard\u2019s owned and chartered vessels along with related cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as:\n\u00b7\nmarine disasters;\n\u00b7\nbad weather;\n\u00b7\nmechanical failures;\n\u00b7\ngrounding, fire, explosions and collisions;\n\u00b7\nhuman error; and\n\u00b7\nwar, piracy and terrorism.\nAll of these hazards can result in death or injury to persons, loss of property, environmental damages, delays or rerouting. If one of Seaboard\u2019s vessels were involved in an accident, the resulting media coverage could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n(5)\nSeaboard\u2019s Common Stock is Thinly Traded and Subject to Daily Price Fluctuations. The common stock of Seaboard is closely held (76.4%) is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour and SFC Preferred LLC , which are beneficially owned by S. Bresky and other members of the Bresky family) and thinly traded on a daily basis on the NYSE MKT. Accordingly, the price of a share of common stock can fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than that of a share of widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis.\n(b)\nPork Division\n(1)\nFluctuations in Commodity Pork Prices Could Adversely Affect Seaboard\u2019s Results of Operations. Sales prices for Seaboard\u2019s pork products are directly affected by both domestic and world-wide supply and demand for pork products and other proteins, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. Commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh pork and competing proteins on the market, especially beef and chicken. Seaboard\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in pork commodity prices.\n(2)\nIncreases in Costs of Seaboard\u2019s Feed Components and Third Party Hog Purchases Could Adversely Affect Seaboard\u2019s Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising hogs and can be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn and soybean meal. The results of Seaboard\u2019s Pork Division can be negatively affected by increased costs of Seaboard\u2019s feed components. The continued operation of ethanol plants has elevated this risk as it has increased the competing demand for feed ingredients, primarily corn. Similarly, accounting for approximately 25% of Seaboard\u2019s total hogs slaughtered, the cost of third party hogs purchased fluctuates with market conditions and can have an impact on Seaboard\u2019s total costs. The cost and supply of feed components and the third party hogs that we purchase are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which are driven by matters over which we have no control, including weather, current and projected worldwide grain stocks and prices, grain export prices and supports and governmental agricultural policies. Seaboard attempts to manage certain of these risks through the use of financial instruments, however this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale pork prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Seaboard\u2019s feed components or in the cost of third party hogs purchased would adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s operating margins.\n(3)\nSeaboard May be Unable to Obtain Appropriate Personnel at Remote Locations. The remote locations of the pork processing plant and live hog operations, and a more restrictive national policy on immigration could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. Seaboard is dependent on having sufficient properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to Seaboard\u2019s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s operations.\n(4)\nThe Loss of Seaboard\u2019s Sole Hog Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard\u2019s Pork Division is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single hog processing facility. The loss of or damage to this facility for any reason - including fire, tornado, governmental action or other reason - could adversely affect Seaboard and Seaboard\u2019s pork business.\n(5)\nEnvironmental Regulation and Related Litigation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Seaboard. Seaboard\u2019s operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to,\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\namong other things, odors, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to Seaboard, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Some requirements applicable to Seaboard may also be enforced by citizen groups. Seaboard has incurred, and will continue to incur, operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\n(6)\nHealth Risk to Livestock Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the hogs and the reproductive performance of the sows can have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to Seaboard\u2019s pork processing operations and consumer confidence. If Seaboard\u2019s hogs are affected by disease, Seaboard may be required to destroy infected livestock, which could adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Moreover, the herd health of third party suppliers could adversely affect the supply and cost of hogs available for purchase by Seaboard. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of Seaboard\u2019s food products.\n(7)\nIf Seaboard\u2019s Pork Products Become Contaminated, We May be Subject to Product Liability Claims and Product Recalls. Pork products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms. These organisms are generally found in the environment and as a result, regardless of the manufacturing practices employed, there is a risk that they could be present in Seaboard\u2019s processed pork products as a result of food processing. Once contaminated products have been shipped for distribution, illness and death may result if the organisms are not eliminated at the further processing, foodservice or consumer level. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s business, reputation, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\n(8)\nInternational Trade Barriers Could Adversely Affect Seaboard\u2019s Pork Operations. This division realizes a significant portion of its revenues from international markets, particularly Japan and Mexico. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. These and other risks could result in border closings or other international trade barriers having an adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s earnings.\n(9)\nThe Operating Profit of the Biodiesel Production Facility Could Be Adversely Impacted by Various Factors. The profitability of Seaboard\u2019s biodiesel plant could be adversely affected by various factors, including the market price of pork and other animal fat which is utilized to produce biodiesel, and the market price for biodiesel which is influenced by world oil prices and U.S. government mandates to use biofuels. Unfavorable changes in these prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in U.S. government mandates to use biofuels, could adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to this facility.\n(c)\nCommodity Trading & Milling Division\n(1)\nThis Division is Subject to Risks Associated with Foreign Operations. This division principally operates in Africa, South America and the Caribbean and, in most cases, in what are generally regarded to be lesser developed countries. Many of these foreign operations are subject to risks of doing business in lesser-developed countries which are subject to potential civil unrests and government instabilities, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, corruption, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls, in addition to the risks of overseas operations mentioned in clause (a)(2) above. In addition, foreign government policies and regulations could restrict the purchase of various grains, reducing or limiting Seaboard\u2019s ability to access grains or to limit Seaboard\u2019s sales price for grains sold in local markets.\n(2)\nFluctuations in Commodity Grain Prices Could Adversely Affect the Business of this Division. This division\u2019s sales are significantly affected by fluctuating worldwide prices for various commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans and, to a lesser degree, various other agricultural commodity products. These prices are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. European flour exports, including donated food aid, flour dumping practices and world-wide and local crop production can contribute to these fluctuating market conditions and can have a significant impact on the trading and\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\nmilling businesses\u2019 sales, value of commodities held in inventory and operating income. Seaboard\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity prices.\n(3)\nThis Division Largely Depends on the Availability of Short-Term Chartered Ships. Most of Seaboard\u2019s third party trading is transported with short-term chartered ships. Charter hire rates, influenced by available charter capacity and demand for worldwide trade in bulk cargoes, port access and throughput time, and related fuel costs can impact business volumes and margins.\n(4)\nThis Division Uses a Material Amount of Derivative Products to Manage Certain Market Risks. The commodity trading portion of the business enters into various commodity derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives to create what management believes is an economic hedge for commodity trades it executes or intends to execute with its customers. This portion of the business also enters into speculative derivative transactions related to its market risks. Failure to execute or improper execution of a derivative position or a firmly committed sale or purchase contract, a speculative transaction that closes without the desired result or exposure to counter party risk could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and liquidity.\n(5)\nThis Division is Subject to Higher than Normal Risks for Attracting and Retaining Key Personnel. In the commodity trading environment, a loss of a key employee such as a commodity trader can have a negative impact resulting from the loss of revenues as personal customer relationships can be vital to obtaining and retaining business with various foreign customers. In the grain processing portion of this division, employing and retaining qualified expatriate personnel is a key element of success given the difficult living conditions, the unique operating environments and the reliance on a relatively small number of executives to manage each individual location.\n(6)\nThis Division faces Increasing Competition. This division is experiencing increasing competition in certain foreign markets by well capitalized originators and traders of commodities making sales directly to end-use customers. If various grain originators refuse to sell commodities to Seaboard for sale in these foreign markets, this could make it more challenging for Seaboard to purchase commodities for sale to its customers at competitive prices. Seaboard\u2019s sales volume and sale prices for commodities to customers as well as results of operations could be adversely impacted by such increased competition.\n(d)\nMarine Division\n(1)\nThe Demand for this Division\u2019s Services Are Affected by International Trade and Fluctuating Freight Rates. This division provides cargo shipping services primarily from the United States to many different countries in the Caribbean Basin, Central and South America. In addition to the risks of overseas operations mentioned in (a)(2) above, fluctuations in economic conditions, unstable or hostile local political situations in the countries in which Seaboard operates, most notably Venezuela in recent years, can affect import/export trade volumes and cargo freight rates and adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s results of operations.\n(2)\nChartered Ships Are Subject to Fluctuating Rates. Time charter expenses are one of the division\u2019s largest expenses. Certain ships are under charters longer than one year while others are less than one year. These costs can vary greatly due to a number of factors including the worldwide supply and demand for shipping. It is not possible to determine in advance whether a charter contract for more or less than one year will be favorable to Seaboard\u2019s business. Accordingly, entering into long-term charter hire contracts during periods of decreasing charter hire costs or short term charter hire contracts during periods of increasing charter hire costs could have an adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s results of operation.\n(3)\nIncreased Fuel Prices May Adversely Affect the Division\u2019s Business. Ship fuel expenses are one of the division\u2019s largest expenses and vary greatly from year to year depending on fuel prices. While most trade lanes have a series of fuel surcharges in place that seek to adjust revenues with changes in fuel prices, such mechanisms do not act with precision in terms of timing and amount. When fuel prices increase rapidly or consistently, the surcharge mechanism may not adjust revenues enough to offset the increase in cost to Seaboard. Fuel surcharges are also an area of competition among carriers and market forces may preclude us from generating enough revenue from the fuel surcharges to offset any increase in costs, which may have a negative effect on Seaboard\u2019s profitability. Also, but to a lesser extent, fuel price increases can impact inland transportation costs both in the U.S. and overseas.\n(4)\nHurricanes May Disrupt Operations in the Caribbean Basin. Seaboard\u2019s port operations throughout the Caribbean Basin can be subject to disruption due to hurricanes, especially at Seaboard\u2019s major ports in Miami, Florida and Houston, Texas, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n(5)\nThis Division is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations that May Adversely Affect the Revenues, Cost, Manner or Feasibility of Doing Business. Federal, state and local laws and domestic and international regulations governing worker health and safety, environmental protection, port and terminal security, and the operation of vessels, including fuel regulations, significantly affect Seaboard\u2019s operations, including rate discussions and other related arrangements. Many aspects of the marine industry, including rate agreements and vessel space sharing agreements, are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission, the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and to regulation by private industry organizations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations and standards, including allowed freight rate discussions and other related arrangements, may result in additional costs or a reduction in revenues.\n(e)\nSugar Division\n(1)\nThe Success of this Division Depends on the Condition of the Argentinean Economy, Currency and Political Climate. This division operates a sugar mill, alcohol production and power generation facility in Argentina, locally growing a substantial portion of the sugar cane processed at the mill. The majority of the sales are within Argentina. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Argentine political climate can have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products and export opportunities and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. In this regard, local sales prices are affected by government price control and sugar import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. If import duties are changed, this could have a negative impact on Seaboard\u2019s sale price of its products. In addition, the Argentine government attempts to control inflation through price controls on commodities, including sugar, which could adversely impact the local sales price of its products and the results of operations for this division. A devaluation of the Argentine peso would have a negative impact on Seaboard\u2019s financial position.\n(2)\nThis Division is Subject to the Risks that Are Inherent in any Agricultural Business. Seaboard\u2019s results of operations for this division may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control and that are inherent in any agricultural business, including reductions in the market prices for Seaboard\u2019s products, adverse weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and new government regulations regarding agriculture and the marketing of agricultural products. Of these risks, weather particularly can adversely affect the amount and quality of the sugar cane produced by Seaboard and Seaboard\u2019s competitors located in other regions of Argentina.\n(3)\nThe Loss of this Division\u2019s Sole Processing Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. Seaboard\u2019s Sugar Division is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single processing facility. The loss of or damage to this facility for any reason - including fire, tornado, earthquake, governmental action, labor unrest resulting in labor strikes or other reasons - would adversely affect the business of this division.\n(4)\nLabor Relation Challenges Could Adversely Affect Operations. This division is dependent on unionized labor at its single sugar mill in Argentina. The political and economic environment in Argentina makes normal labor relations very challenging. Contributing to the situation are the policies of Argentina\u2019s National Government and the failure of the Argentine courts to enforce contractual obligations with unions and basic property rights. Interruptions in production as a result of labor unrest can adversely impact the quantity of sugar cane harvested and the amount of sugar, alcohol and power produced and can interfere with the distribution of products stored at the facility in the Salta Province.\n(5)\nThe Operating Profit of the Alcohol Production Facility Could Be Adversely Impacted by Government Regulations. The profitability of Seaboard\u2019s alcohol production facility could be adversely affected by Argentine government regulations related to the bio-ethanol market regarding production quotas and fuel blends. In addition, the entry of corn alcohol producers in Argentina may increase competition. Unfavorable changes in market prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in the Argentine government\u2019s regulations regarding bio-ethanol production quotas and fuel blends, could adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s results of operations.\n(6)\nThe Operating Profit of the Cogeneration Power Plant Could Be Adversely Impacted by Contract for the Sale of Energy. In 2013, the biomass cogeneration contract was ratified by the Argentine national energy regulator setting the sale price for energy produced and sold by Seaboard\u2019s cogeneration power plant. The profitability of Seaboard\u2019s cogeneration power plant could be adversely affected by the failure to enforce the terms of the contract, which could\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\nadversely affect Seaboard\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to this facility.\n(f)\nPower Division\n(1)\nThis Division is Subject to Risks of Doing Business in the Dominican Republic. This division operates in the Dominican Republic (DR). In addition to significant currency fluctuations and the other risks of overseas operations mentioned in clause (a)(2) above, this division can experience difficulty in obtaining timely collections of trade receivables from the government owned distribution companies or other companies that must also collect from the government in order to make payments on their accounts. Currently, the DR does not allow a free market to enable prices to rise with demand which could limit our profitability in this business. The government has the ability to arbitrarily decide which power units will be able to operate, which can ultimately determine spot market prices for electricity generated and sold into the power grid and thus could have adverse effects on results of operations.\n(2)\nFluctuations in Fuel Costs Could Adversely Affect Seaboard\u2019s Operating Margins. Fuel is the largest cost component of this division\u2019s business and, therefore, margins may be adversely affected by fluctuations in fuel prices if such fluctuations cannot be fully passed to customers through the spot market price mechanism.\n(3)\nSupply of Natural Gas is Limited in the Dominican Republic. Supply of natural gas in the Dominican Republic is limited to one primary supplier. Although the recently constructed barge can run on other types of fuel, supply disruptions of natural gas could have a negative impact on this division\u2019s operating income.\n(g)\nTurkey Segment\n(1)\nFluctuations in Commodity Turkey Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for turkey products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for turkey products and other proteins which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Butterball has little or no control. Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the turkey commodity prices.\n(2)\nIncreases in Costs of Turkey\u2019s Feed Components and Turkey Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising turkeys and can be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn, soybean meal, and other commodity grain inputs. Butterball\u2019s results may be negatively affected by increased costs of the feed components. The continued operation of ethanol plants has elevated this risk as it has increased the competing demand for feed ingredients, primarily corn. Butterball attempts to manage some of these risks through the use of financial instruments; however this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale turkey prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Butterball\u2019s feed components would adversely affect Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(3)\nAdverse Operating Results Could Result in Need for Additional Investment. Butterball has third party bank loan facilities separate from Seaboard which are secured by substantially all of the assets of Butterball. Adverse operating results could cause Butterball to default on such loan facilities which could result in a significant adverse impact on Butterball\u2019s financial position, or result in Seaboard needing to increase Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(4)\nDecreased Perception of Value in the Butterball\u2019s Brand Could Adversely Affect Sales Quantity and Price of Butterball Products. Butterball is a premium brand name, built on a long history of offering a quality product that has been differentiated in the market. The value of the Butterball brand allows for sales of a higher unit price than other turkey products. In order to maintain this advantage, Butterball must continue to support the brand with successful marketing efforts. In addition, negative news reports for any reason in a variety of areas on the company or the turkey/poultry industry could negatively impact this brand perception and Butterball\u2019s results of operation and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(5)\nThe Loss of Butterball\u2019s Primary Further Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Butterball\u2019s Business. Although Butterball has four processing plants and two further processing plants, Butterball is disproportionately dependent on the continued operation of the processing plant in Mt. Olive, North Carolina that handles a significant volume of the production of further processed turkey products. The loss of or damage to this facility for any reason - including fire, tornado, governmental action or other reason - could adversely affect the results of operation for Butterball and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\nFORM 10-K\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n(6)\nIf Butterball\u2019s Turkey Products Become Contaminated, the Company May be Subject to Product Liability Claims and Product Recalls. Turkey products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms. These organisms are generally found in the environment and as a result, there is a risk that they may contaminate products. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, reputation, and prospects. This could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of Butterball and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(7)\nHealth Risk to Poultry Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Butterball\u2019s Business. Butterball is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the turkeys and reproductive performance can have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to Butterball\u2019s processing operations and consumer confidence. If Butterball\u2019s turkeys are affected by disease, Butterball may be required to destroy infected birds, which could adversely affect Butterball\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of Butterball food products, resulting in an adverse effect on Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(8)\nButterball May be Unable to Obtain Appropriate Personnel at Remote Locations. The remote locations of some of the turkey processing plants and live turkey operations along with a more restrictive national policy on immigration could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. Butterball is dependent on having sufficient properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to Butterball\u2019s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Butterball\u2019s operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.", "PERMNO": 36281, "SIC": 9997, "TIC": "SEB"}
