{"cik": "931059", "company": "Rennova Health, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is highly speculative and subject to numerous and substantial risks. These risks include those set forth herein. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report before you decide to invest in our securities. If any of the following events actually occur, our business could be materially harmed. In such case, the value of your investment may decline and you may lose or all part of your investment. You should not invest in our securities unless you can afford the loss of your entire investment.\nAlthough our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we have recently accumulated significant losses and have negative cash flows from operations, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to improve our liquidity position we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nThe Company has recently accumulated significant losses and has negative cash flows from operations, and at December 31, 2016 had a working capital deficit and stockholders\u2019 deficit of $16.3 million and $14.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders in the amount of $32.6 million and $37.6 million, respectively. In addition, the Company's cash position is critically deficient, critical payments are not being made in the ordinary course, the Company is in default of two promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $0.4 million and additional indebtedness in the amount of $6.0 million matured on March 31, 2017 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). This indebtedness is secured by receivables that we have filed suit to recover from a national payer and while we believe that we will be successful in such recovery there can be no assurances as to our ability to collect on these receivables, and the Company does not have the financial resources to satisfy this indebtedness. All of the foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is currently executing on a plan of action to reduce the number of laboratory facilities it operates from five such facilities as of December 31, 2015 into one, with a corresponding reduction in the number of employees and associated operating expenses, in order to reduce costs. In addition, the Company issued $12.4 million of convertible notes in the first three months of 2017, for which it received net proceeds of $9.9 million. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan, raise any additional capital or secure the additional financing necessary to implement its current operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to significantly reduce its operating costs, increase its revenues and eventually regain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ.\nOn January 11, 2017, we were notified by Nasdaq that we no longer comply with Nasdaq's audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 (the \"Rule\"), which requires the audit committee of the Company's board of directors to have at least three members, each of whom must be independent directors as defined under the Rule. With the passing of Benjamin Frank in December of 2016, our audit committee currently consists of two independent directors. In accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(4), we have until the earlier of our next annual shareholders' meeting or December 18, 2017 to regain compliance; or, if our next annual shareholders' meeting is held before June 16, 2017, then we must evidence compliance no later than June 16, 2017. If we do not regain compliance by the foregoing applicable dates, then Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be delisted.\nIn the future, our common stock may fall below the NASDAQ listing requirements or we may not comply with other listing requirements, with the result being that our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we may list our common stock for trading over the counter. Delisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock. A determination could also then be made that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading. This could have a long-term impact on our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock.\nOur acquisition of the Hospital Assets does not provide assurance that the acquired operations will be accretive to our earnings or otherwise improve our results of operations.\nAcquisitions, such as that of the Hospital Assets in January of 2017, involve the integration of previously separate businesses into a common enterprise in which it is envisioned that synergistic operations will be result in improved financial performance. However, realization of these envisioned results is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 Diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;\n\u00b7 Difficulties integrating the acquired business, technologies and personnel into our business;\n\u00b7 Potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of the acquired business; and\n\u00b7 Exposure to unforeseen liabilities of the acquired business\nThere is no assurance that the acquisition of the Hospital Assets will be accretive to our earnings or otherwise improve our results of operations.\nThe opening of Big South Fork Medical Center is subject to the receipt of necessary licenses and regulatory approvals and will require continued investment by the Company.\nWe acquired the Hospital Assets on January 13, 2017, and we expect to have the hospital (now renamed as Big South Fork Medical Center) open in part in the second quarter of 2017, and that the hospital will be fully operational by the third quarter of 2017, although no assurance can be given that either of these time frames will be met. Opening and operating a hospital requires numerous licenses and regulatory approvals and the failure to receive one such license or approval may prevent the hospital from opening. The process of gaining all such licenses and approvals may take a substantial amount of time.\nThe reopening of the hospital will require substantial investment by the Company and we may not have the funds or be able to access such funds when necessary. We will need to fully fund the operations of the hospital out of our own resources for an extended period because the hospital will not receive reimbursement for any services for a number of months after they are performed, or otherwise generate any positive cash flow. Because the hospital has been closed since July 2016, it could take a long period of time for utilization of the hospital to reach pre-closure levels, and no assurance can be made that it will do so or that utilization will be sufficient to cover the costs of operating the hospital.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if the ACA is repealed, replaced or otherwise changed.\nThe ACA has increased the number of people with health care insurance. It also has reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Numerous proposals continue to be discussed in Congress and the administration to repeal, amend or replace the law. We cannot predict whether any such repeal, amend or replace proposals, or any parts of them, will become law and, if they do, what their substance or timing will be. Any of the foregoing, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratory licensing laws to which we are subject.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not preempt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Many other states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties.\nWe cannot assure you that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nHealthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical test services.\nWe also face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including healthcare plans, to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans and payers, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These healthcare plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capped payment arrangements. In addition, some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the PPO or Point of Service (\u201cPOS\u201d) laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among healthcare plans and payers increases the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. The Health Care Reform Law includes provisions, including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, which may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.\nWe expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services. These efforts, including future changes in third-party payer rules, practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to many healthcare plans, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnless we raise sufficient funds, we will not be able to succeed in our business model.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report, we have relied on the sale of our equity securities and from short term advances from one of our directors, Christopher Diamantis, to fund our operations. We generated negative cash flow from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. If this trend were to continue and we are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations through other sources, our business will be adversely effected, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern (see Item 7., Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d). There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, to fund our operations under our current business model.\nRegulation by the FDA of LDTs and clinical laboratories may result in significant change, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nHigh complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories, such as ours, frequently develop testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests have been traditionally offered by nearly all complex laboratories for the last few decades and LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA, which regulates the development and use of medical devices, has claimed that it has regulatory authority over LDTs, but has not exercised enforcement with respect to most LDTs offered by high complexity laboratories, and not sought to require these laboratories to comply with FDA regulations regarding medical devices. During 2010, the FDA publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over these LDTs, and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. At that time, the FDA indicated that it would use a risk-based approach to regulation and would direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. In September 2014, the FDA announced its framework and timetable for implementing this guidance. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach, and on January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such guidance or regulation or their potential impact. If adopted, such a regulatory approach by the FDA may lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of the FDA's approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our operations are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and other laws designed to prohibit payments for referrals and eliminate healthcare fraud.\nFederal and state anti-kickback and similar laws prohibit payment, or offers of payment, in exchange for referrals of products and services for which reimbursement may be made by Medicare or other federal and state healthcare programs. Some state laws contain similar prohibitions that apply without regard to the payer of reimbursement for the services. Under a federal statute, known as the \u201cStark Law\u201d or \u201cself-referral\u201d prohibition, physicians, subject to certain exceptions, are prohibited from referring their Medicare or Medicaid program patients to clinical laboratories with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship, and the laboratories are prohibited from billing for services rendered in violation of Stark Law referral prohibitions. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and Stark Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. States may impose similar penalties. The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Law provisions, and other health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by private citizen \u201crelators\u201d for perceived violations of these laws. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen relators under federal or state false claims laws.\nFederal officials responsible for administering and enforcing the healthcare laws and regulations have made a priority of eliminating healthcare fraud. For example, the Health Care Reform Law includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increased potential penalties for violations. Federal funding available for combating health care fraud and abuse generally has increased. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, many of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians, hospitals and patients, contain language that has not been interpreted by courts. We must rely on our interpretation of these laws and regulations based on the advice of our counsel and regulatory or law enforcement authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations and may seek to enforce legal remedies or penalties against us for violations.\nFrom time to time we may need to change our operations, particularly pricing or billing practices, in response to changing interpretations of these laws and regulations, or regulatory or judicial determinations with respect to these laws and regulations. These occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and harm important business relationships that we have with healthcare providers, payers and others. Furthermore, if a regulatory or judicial authority finds that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations, we would be required to refund amounts that were billed and collected in violation of such laws and regulations. In addition, we may voluntarily refund amounts that were alleged to have been billed and collected in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In either case, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, regardless of the outcome, if we or physicians or other third parties with whom we do business are investigated by a regulatory or law enforcement authority we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and our management may be required to divert a substantial amount of time to an investigation.\nTo enhance compliance with applicable health care laws, and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities, such as the OIG, have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual, and for many years the OIG has made available a model compliance program targeted to the clinical laboratory industry. In addition, certain states require that health care providers, such as clinical laboratories, that engage in substantial business under the state Medicaid program have a compliance program that generally adheres to the standards set forth in the Model Compliance Program. Also, under the Health Care Reform Law, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will require suppliers, such as the Company, to adopt, as a condition of Medicare participation, compliance programs that meet a core set of requirements. While we have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, healthcare compliance and ethics programs that generally incorporate the OIG's recommendations, and training our applicable employees in such compliance, having such a program can be no assurance that we will avoid any compliance issues.\nWe conduct our clinical laboratory testing business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could, directly or indirectly, harm our operating results and financial condition.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is highly regulated and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. Areas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 federal and state laws applicable to billing and claims payment;\n\u00b7 federal and state laboratory anti-mark-up laws;\n\u00b7 federal and state anti-kickback laws;\n\u00b7 federal and state false claims laws;\n\u00b7 federal and state self-referral and financial inducement laws, including the federal physician anti-self-referral law, or the Stark Law;\n\u00b7 coverage and reimbursement levels by Medicare and other governmental payors and private insurers;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws governing laboratory licensing and testing, including CLIA;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws governing the development, use and distribution of diagnostic medical tests known as laboratory developed tests or \u201cLDTs\u201d;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, along with the revisions to HIPAA as a result of the HITECH Act, and analogous state laws;\n\u00b7 federal, state and foreign regulation of privacy, security, electronic transactions and identity theft;\n\u00b7 federal, state and local laws governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical and hazardous waste;\n\u00b7 Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules and regulations;\n\u00b7 changes to laws, regulations and rules as a result of the Health Care Reform Law; and\n\u00b7 changes to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including tax laws.\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws or regulations, could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, a significant change in any of these laws or regulations may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws or regulations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with complex federal and state laws and regulations related to submission of claims for clinical laboratory services can result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the submission of claims for payment for clinical laboratory services, including those that relate to coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental health care programs, the amounts that may be billed for our services and to whom claims for services may be submitted.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or result in attempts by third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments from us that have already been made. Submission of claims in violation of certain statutory or regulatory requirements can result in penalties, including substantial civil money penalties for each item or service billed to Medicare in violation of the legal requirement, and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Government authorities may also assert that violations of laws and regulations related to submission or causing the submission of claims violate the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) or other laws related to fraud and abuse, including submission of claims for services that were not medically necessary. Violations of the FCA could result in enormous economic liability. The FCA provides that all damages are trebled, and each false claim submitted is subject to a penalty of up to $11,000. For example, we could be subject to FCA liability if it was determined that the services we provided were not medically necessary and not reimbursable, particularly if it were asserted that we contributed to the physician's referrals of unnecessary services to us. It is also possible that the government could attempt to hold us liable under fraud and abuse laws for improper claims submitted by an entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement that resulted in submission of the improper claims.\nWe continuously conduct internal audits on current and historical billings to protect against errors related to any of the above. One of these audits has led us to retain an independent consulting firm to assess if any violations to the foregoing regulations have occurred in the historical billings by our laboratories. If the review determines that any overpayment was received, we will inform the relative party and make arrangements to repay any overpayment.\nChanges in regulation and policies, including increasing downward pressure on health care reimbursement, may adversely affect reimbursement for diagnostic services and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nReimbursement levels for health care services are subject to continuous and often unexpected changes in policies, and we face a variety of efforts by government payers to reduce utilization and reimbursement for diagnostic testing services. Changes in governmental reimbursement may result from statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, administrative rulings, competitive bidding initiatives, and other policy changes.\nThe U.S. Congress has considered, at least yearly in conjunction with budgetary legislation, changes to the Medicare fee schedules under which we receive reimbursement. For example, currently there is no copayment or coinsurance required for clinical laboratory services. However, Congress has periodically considered imposing a 20 percent coinsurance on laboratory services. If enacted, this would require us to attempt to collect this amount from patients, although in many cases the costs of collection would exceed the amount actually received.\nThe CMS pays laboratories on the basis of a fee schedule that is reviewed and re-calculated on an annual basis. CMS may change the fee schedule upward or downward on billing codes that we submit for reimbursement on a regular basis; our revenue and business may be adversely affected if the reimbursement rates associated with such codes are reduced. Even when reimbursement rates are not reduced, policy changes add to our costs by increasing the complexity and volume of administrative requirements. Medicaid reimbursement, which varies by state, is also subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. Recently, state budget pressures have caused states to consider several policy changes that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility and service coverage, and imposing taxes on our services.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals and employer groups. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems.\nMissing, incomplete, or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing or even having to pay back amounts incorrectly billed and collected could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in CMS and other government programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nThere have been times when our accounts receivables have increased at a greater rate than revenue growth and, therefore, have adversely affected our cash flows from operations. We have taken steps to implement systems and processing changes intended to improve billing procedures and related collection results. However, we cannot assure that our ongoing assessment of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional provisions. Such additional provisions, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nDuring the last half of 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015, the Company experienced difficulty in delivering accurate electronic submissions to third party payers. The difficulties arose from a variety of factors, including pressure, scrutiny and requirement for additional information from payers related to toxicology services, difficulty complying with CMS\u2019s new HCPCS codes for toxicology services, difficulty in accurately billing for internal reference laboratory work, and complications arising from the implementation of new billing technology. These difficulties have a significant impact on the time it takes the Company to collect its receivables and consequently on its cash flow from operations. The Company believes that these difficulties were corrected in the fourth quarter of 2015, but there can be no assurance that CMS and other third party payers will not change their requirements resulting in further billing related difficulties.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.\nOur operations are always subject to adverse impacts resulting from extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services. The occurrence of any such event and/or a disruption of our operations as a result may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nWe operate in a business that is characterized by intense competition. Our major competitors include large national laboratories that possess greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel than we do. Many of our competitors have long established relationships. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the future.\nThe clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. Pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. As a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. We may also face competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. Additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nFailure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.\nThe Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, and infectious and hazardous waste materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of the Company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that the Company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of emergency controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the Company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the Company which may be costly.\nRegulations requiring the use of \u201cstandard transactions\u201d for health care services issued under HIPAA may negatively impact the Company's profitability and cash flows.\nPursuant to HIPAA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged.\nThe HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the Company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the Company by physicians. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the Company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the Company by physicians, the Company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments and the ICD-10-CM Code Set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement.\nFailure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the Company's reputation with customers, and cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation.\nPursuant to HIPAA and certain similar state laws, we must comply with comprehensive privacy and security standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information. Under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA, HIPAA was expanded to require certain data breach notifications, to extend certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly to business associates, to heighten penalties for noncompliance and to enhance enforcement efforts.\nThe Company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. In addition, the Company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise in the Company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the Company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the Company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. It could also result in litigation against the Company or the imposition of penalties.\nFailure of the Company, third party payers or physicians to comply with the ICD-10-CM Code Set and our failure to comply with other emerging electronic transmission standards could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The Company implemented Version 5010 of the HIPAA Transaction Standards, and believes it has fully adopted the ICD-10-CM code set. The compliance date for ICD-10-CM was October 1, 2015. Clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. The diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. The failure of the Company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, day's sales outstanding and cash collections.\nAlso, the failure of our IT systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology (\"HCIT\") standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information, including test orders and test results, could require costly modifications to our existing HCIT systems. While we do not expect HCIT standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply, if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing HCIT standards, we could lose customers and business opportunities.\nCompliance with the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the Company's costs.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u00b7 the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the Company's services, and its healthcare operations activities;\n\u00b7 a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;\n\u00b7 the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information;\n\u00b7 administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and\n\u00b7 the protection of computing systems maintaining Electronic Personal Health Information (\u201cePHI\u201d).\nThe Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish a \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, the Company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the Company may also be required to comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict the Company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Due to the enactment of HITECH and an increase in the amount of monetary financial penalties, government enforcement has also increased. It is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be, other than heightened scrutiny and emphasis on compliance. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to significant monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, the Company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information.\nThe clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions.\nAdvances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. Development of such technology and its use by the Company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues.\nCurrently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under CLIA. The cost of compliance with CLIA makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. Diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be \u201cwaived\u201d tests under CLIA and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. Other tests meeting certain FDA criteria also may be classified as \u201cwaived\u201d for CLIA purposes. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the CDC for classifying the complexity of tests for CLIA purposes. Increased approval of \u201cwaived\u201d test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the Company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues.\nHealth care reform and related programs (e.g. Health Insurance Exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nTesting services are billed to private patients, Medicare, Medicaid, commercial clients, managed care organizations (\u201cMCOs\u201d) and third-party insurance companies. Tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. Most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. Increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the Company's net revenues.\nThe various MCOs have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. Some MCOs contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. Other MCOs adopt broader networks with a largely uniform fee structure offered to all participating clinical laboratories. In addition, some MCOs have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated reimbursement mechanism, the clinical laboratory and the managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to pay for all authorized laboratory tests ordered during the month by the physician for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. Capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider.\nA portion of the third-party insurance fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. As patient cost-sharing increases, collectability may be impacted.\nIn addition, Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. Measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. Pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care plans has increased. The percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. Changes to, or repeal of, the Health Care Reform Law, the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, also may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable.\nThe Company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. If the Company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nAs an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the Company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. These changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. Given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to or repeal of the Health Care Reform Law, the exact impact to employers including the Company is uncertain.\nA failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the Company's ability to successfully grow its business.\nTo offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services and to otherwise grow its business, the Company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. In addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the Company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's net revenues and profitability. The Company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, timeliness of test reporting, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. The Company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the Company's ability to expand its customer base.\nIn addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. The Company's inability to create relationships with those provider systems and networks could impact its ability to successfully grow its business.\nA failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability.\nPart of the Company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the Company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the Company's capabilities and increase its presence in key geographic areas. Since January 1, 2013, the Company has acquired the Hospital Assets, clinical laboratories in California, New Jersey and New Mexico in addition to Clinlab, Medical Mime and CollabRx. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the Company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the Company's operating results. Furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u00b7 failure to obtain regulatory clearance;\n\u00b7 loss of key customers or employees;\n\u00b7 difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information, including lack of complete integration;\n\u00b7 unidentified regulatory problems;\n\u00b7 failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided;\n\u00b7 coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and\n\u00b7 diversion of management's attention from the present core business of the Company.\nThe Company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the Company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. Even if the Company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions.\nAdverse results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe Company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability, contracts and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial Federal and state government regulation and audit. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the Company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business.\nAs a company with limited capital and human resources, we anticipate that more of management's time and attention will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements than would be the case with a company that has well established controls and procedures. This diversion of management's time and attention may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, or if we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal control over financial reporting when we are required to do so, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock, if any, and ability to obtain any necessary equity or debt financing could suffer. In addition, in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal control over financial reporting in connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures, we may be unable to file our periodic reports with the SEC. This would likely have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock, if any, and our ability to secure any necessary additional financing, and could result in the delisting of our common stock. In such event, the liquidity of our common stock would be severely limited and the market price of our common stock would likely decline significantly.\nAn inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the Company's clinical laboratories and at the hospital could adversely affect the business. The success of the Company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team.\nIn addition, the success of the Company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. The Company will also need to recruit and hire a complete staff for the hospital, including doctors and other healthcare professionals. In the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the Company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. The Company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the Company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment.\nFailure in the Company's information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the Company's operations or customer relationships.\nThe Company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. Despite network security measures and other precautions, the Company\u2019s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. Sustained system failures or interruption of the Company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the Company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. Breaches with respect to protected health information could result in violations of HIPAA and analogous state laws, and risk the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Failure of the Company's information technology systems could adversely affect the Company's business, profitability and financial condition.\nA significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit.\nThe Company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, MCOs, and others. A significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. In addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the Company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future.\nIncreasing health insurance premiums and co-payments or high deductible health plans may cause individuals to forgo health insurance and avoid medical attention, either of which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nHealth insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles have generally increased in recent years. These increases may cause individuals to forgo health insurance, as well as medical attention. This behavior may reduce demand for testing by our laboratories.\nOur business has substantial indebtedness.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage. As of December 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding, excluding the effects of derivative liabilities and unamortized discounts, of approximately $9.1 million, all of which is short term. In addition, our capital lease obligations were approximately $3.6 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt, and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nFailure to achieve and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may result in our not being able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nOur management has determined that as of December 31, 2016, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the results of our remediation efforts regarding our material weaknesses are not successful, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.\nHardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement system enhancements or cyber security breaches may harm the Company.\nThe Company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. A failure of the network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, we currently do not have sufficient redundant facilities to provide IT capacity in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions the Company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to clients.\nIn addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the Company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. Such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to clients. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the Company's reputation and harm the business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the Company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. Although the Company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is in the process of renewing his visa to enter the United States.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is Seamus Lagan, who also acts as our interim Chief Financial Officer. In 2014, through Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) Mr. Lagan received an E2 Visa and worked at the Company\u2019s offices in West Palm Beach, Florida. His visa expired in late 2016. Mr. Lagan is now in the process of applying for a new E2 visa. Historical financing activities have been completed by our CEO. No assurance can be given as to when or if his new visa will be granted, and a continued lengthy absence of Mr. Lagan from the United States may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business or ability to secure additional financing.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders may consider in their best interests, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms to be fixed by our board of directors. Stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner. Issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us, and could effectively be used as an anti-takeover device.\nOur bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and require that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president or the board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nAs a public company, we incur significant administrative workload and expenses.\nAs a public company with common stock listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we must comply with various laws, regulations and requirements, including certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements, including our public company reporting requirements, continues to occupy a significant amount of the time of our board of directors and management and involves significant accounting, legal and other expenses. We will need to hire additional accounting personnel to handle these responsibilities, which will increase our operating costs. Furthermore, these laws, regulations and requirements could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nNew laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ Stock Market, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. We are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. We anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our Common Stock appreciates, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe may use our stock to pay, to a large extent, for future acquisitions or for the repayment of debt, which would be dilutive to investors.\nWe may choose to use additional stock to pay, to a large extent, for future acquisitions, and believe that doing so will enable us to retain a greater percentage of our operating capital to pay for operations and marketing. Price and volume fluctuations in our stock might negatively impact our ability to effectively use our stock to pay for acquisitions, or could cause us to offer stock as consideration for acquisitions on terms that are not favorable to us and our stockholders. If we did resort to issuing stock in lieu of cash for acquisitions under unfavorable circumstances, it would result in increased dilution to investors.\nOur Common Stock is subject to substantial dilution.\nThe Company has outstanding options, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt. Exercise of the options and warrants, and/or conversion of the convertible preferred stock and debt could result in substantial dilution of our Common Stock and a decline in its market price.\nThe following table presents the dilutive effect of our various potential common shares as of December 31, 2016, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split:", "PERMNO": 82530, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "RNVA"}
