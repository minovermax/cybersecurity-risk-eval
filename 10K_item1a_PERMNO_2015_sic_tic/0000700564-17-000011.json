Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Corporation's securities involves certain risks, including, among others, the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors.\nECONOMIC AND CREDIT RISKS.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the capital markets may materially adversely affect the Corporation's business and results of operations.\nThe Corporation's results of operations and financial condition are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. The Corporation's financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability, or increases in the cost, of credit and capital, changes in the rate of inflation, changes in interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, global economic conditions and geopolitical factors, or a combination of these or other factors.\nSpecifically, the business environment impacts the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay principal of, outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Corporation offers. If the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio declines, the Corporation may have to increase its provision for credit losses, which would negatively impact its results of operations, and could result in charge-offs of a higher percentage of its loans. Unlike large, national institutions, the Corporation is not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which the Corporation operates do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, its business could be adversely affected. In addition, increased market competition in a lower demand environment could adversely affect the profit potential of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation is subject to certain risks in connection with the establishment and level of its allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. While the Corporation believes that its allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2016 is sufficient to cover incurred losses in the loan portfolio on that date, the Corporation may need to increase its provision for credit losses due to changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, thereby negatively impacting its results of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management\u2019s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. Management\u2019s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio is dependent on the proper application of its methodology for determining its allowance needs. The most critical judgments underpinning that methodology include: the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner; proper collateral valuation of loans evaluated for impairment; proper measurement of allowance needs for pools of loans measured for impairment; and an overall assessment of the risk profile of the loan portfolio.\nThe Corporation determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including, but not limited to: the size and composition of the loan portfolio; changes in risk ratings; changes in collateral values; delinquency levels; historical losses; and economic conditions. In addition, as the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio grows, it will generally be necessary to increase the allowance for credit losses through additional provisions, which will impact the Corporation\u2019s operating results.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s assumptions and judgments regarding such matters prove to be inaccurate, its allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient, and additional provisions for credit losses might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such provisions for credit losses, the adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s earnings could be material.\nFurthermore, banking regulators may require the Corporation to make additional provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs or impairments following their periodic reviews of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio, underwriting procedures and allowance for credit losses. Any increase in the Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses.\"\nEconomic downturns and the composition of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio subject the Corporation to credit risk.\nNational, regional and local economic conditions can impact the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, such as a substantial decline in the stock market, could weaken the economies of the communities the Corporation serves. Weakness in the market areas served by the Corporation may depress the Corporation\u2019s earnings and consequently its financial condition because:\n\u2022\nBorrowers may not be able to pay interest on, and repay their principal of, outstanding loans;\n\u2022\nthe value of the collateral securing the Corporation's loans to borrowers may decline; and\n\u2022\ndemand for loans, as well as and other products and services the Corporation offers, may decline.\nApproximately $10.9 billion, or 74.5%, of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio was in commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans, and construction loans at December 31, 2016. Commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and consumer loans because they typically have larger balances and are likely to be more sensitive to broader economic factors and conditions. Because payments on these loans often depend on the successful operation and management of businesses and properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate markets, adverse economic conditions or changes in government regulation. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Commercial real estate prices, according to many U.S. commercial real estate indices, are currently above the 2007 peak levels that contributed to the financial crisis. Accordingly, the federal bank regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. The Corporation\u2019s failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect its ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses, from this portfolio. Furthermore, intense competition among lenders, coupled with moderate levels of recent economic growth, can increase pressure on the Corporation to relax its credit standards and/or underwriting criteria in order to achieve the Corporation\u2019s loan growth targets. A relaxation of credit standards or underwriting criteria could result in greater challenges in the repayment or collection of loans should economic conditions, or individual borrower performance, deteriorate to a degree that could impact loan performance. Additionally, competitive pressures could drive the Corporation to consider loans and customer relationships that are outside of the Corporation\u2019s established risk appetite or target customer base. See Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Loans.\"\nMARKET RISKS.\nThe Corporation is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Corporation cannot predict or control changes in interest rates. The Corporation is affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the FRB, which regulates the national money supply and engages in other lending and investment activities in order to manage recessionary and inflationary pressures, many of which affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of the Corporation's net income, accounting for approximately 74% of total revenues in 2016. In recent years, the narrowing of interest rate spreads, the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments and interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, has adversely affected the Corporation's net interest income.\nLow market interest rates have pressured the net interest margin in recent years. Interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, have been originated, acquired or repriced at lower rates, reducing the average rate earned on those assets. While the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, has also declined, the decline has not always occurred at the same pace as the decline in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets, resulting in a narrowing of the net interest margin.\nCompetition sometimes pressures the Corporation to lower rates charged on loans more than the decline in market rates would otherwise indicate. Competition may also pressure the Corporation to pay higher rates on deposits than market rates would otherwise indicate. Thus, although loan demand has improved in recent years, intense competition among lenders has contributed to downward pressure on loan yields, also narrowing the net interest margin. Further, due to historically low market interest rates, rates paid on deposits have tended to reach a natural floor below which it is difficult to further reduce such rates. See Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Net Interest Income.\"\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and certain investment securities, most notably mortgage-backed securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and certain investment securities, as borrowers or issuers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under those circumstances, the Corporation would be subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is not able to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on the loans and investment securities which are prepaid. Conversely, increases in interest rates may extend the average life of fixed rate assets, which could restrict the Corporation\u2019s ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of interest-earning investment securities. Generally, the value of interest-earning investment securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s portfolio of interest-earning investment securities was $2.5 billion. Net unrealized losses on these securities was $47.3 million at December 31, 2016. Whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of an investment security constitutes other-than-temporary impairment depends on a number of factors, including whether the Corporation has the intent and ability to retain the investment security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nChanges in interest rates can affect demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services.\nMovements in interest rates can cause demand for some of the Corporation\u2019s products and services to be cyclical. As a result, the Corporation may need to periodically increase or decrease the size of certain of its businesses, including its personnel, to more appropriately match increases and decreases in demand and volume. The need to change the scale of these businesses is challenging, and there is often a lag between changes in the businesses and the Corporation\u2019s reaction to these changes. For example, demand for residential mortgage loans has historically tended to increase during periods when interest rates were declining and to decrease during periods when interest rates were rising.\nPrice fluctuations in securities markets, as well as other market events, such as a disruption in credit and other markets and the abnormal functioning of markets for securities, could have an impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nThe market value of the Corporation's securities investments, which include mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities, auction rate securities, corporate debt securities and equity investments, as well as the revenues the Corporation earns from its trust and investment management services business, are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations and market events. Declines in the values of the Corporation\u2019s securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation\u2019s securities investments included $97.3 million of investments in student loan auction rate certificates (\"ARCs\"). Following the failures of periodic auctions for these ARCs, which began in 2008 and have continued since that time, there has not been an active market for these securities. Other than sporadic redemptions and tender offers made by the issuers of these ARCs, these securities are illiquid. Secondary market transactions involving ARCs typically represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for determining their fair value. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell the ARCs it holds and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of the ARCs it holds prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost, which may be at maturity. However, if the Corporation chose to liquidate these securities prior to their maturity, it would likely have to do so at \"distressed\" sale prices and would likely do so at a loss.\nA portion of the Corporation's securities portfolio includes holdings of equity investments, including stocks of publicly traded financial institutions. The portfolio of publicly traded financial institutions includes shares of a single financial institution which, as of December 31, 2016, had a fair value of $11.9 million. The Corporation's holdings of this financial institution\u2019s securities constituted approximately 50.5% of the fair value of the Corporation's aggregate holdings of publicly traded financial institutions\u2019 securities as of that date.\nThe Corporation's investment management and trust services revenue, which is partially based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios, can also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets. If the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. or international securities markets, in general, or otherwise, the Corporation's revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Corporation's ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers' level of confidence in securities markets. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nLIQUIDITY RISK.\nChanges in interest rates or disruption in liquidity markets may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s sources of funding.\nThe Corporation must maintain sufficient sources of liquidity to meet the demands of its depositors and borrowers, support its operations and meet regulatory expectations. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity management policies and practices emphasize core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments as its primary sources of liquidity. These primary sources of liquidity can be supplemented by FHLB advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank, proceeds from the sales of loans and use of liquidity resources of the holding company, including capital markets funding. Lower-cost, core deposits may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, and secondary sources of liquidity can be more costly to the Corporation than funding provided by deposit account balances having similar maturities. In addition, adverse changes in the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition, downgrades in the Corporation\u2019s credit ratings, regulatory actions involving the Corporation, or changes in regulatory, industry or market conditions could lead to increases in the cost of these secondary sources of liquidity, the inability to refinance or replace these secondary funding sources as they mature, or the withdrawal of unused borrowing capacity under these secondary funding sources.\nWhile the Corporation attempts to manage its liquidity through various techniques, the assumptions and estimates used do not always accurately forecast the impact of changes in customer behavior. For example, the Corporation may face limitations on its ability to fund loan growth if customers move funds out of the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries\u2019 deposit accounts in response to increases in interest rates. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, even as the general level of market interest rates remained low by historical standards, depositors frequently avoided higher-yielding and higher-risk alternative investments, in favor of the safety and liquidity of non-maturing deposit accounts. These circumstances contributed to significant growth in non-maturing deposit account balances at the Corporation, and at depository financial institutions generally. Should interest rates rise, customers may become more sensitive to interest rates when making deposit decisions and considering alternative opportunities. This increased sensitivity to interest rates could cause customers to move funds into higher-yielding deposit accounts offered by the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries, require the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to retain customer deposits or cause customers to move funds into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers. Technology and other factors have also made it more convenient for customers to transfer low-cost deposits into higher-cost deposits or into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers. Movement of customer deposits into higher-yielding deposit accounts offered by the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries, the need to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to retain customer deposits or the movement of customer deposits into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers could increase the Corporation\u2019s funding costs, reduce its net interest margin and/or create liquidity challenges.\nMarket conditions have been negatively impacted by disruptions in the liquidity markets in the past, and such disruptions or an adverse change in the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on secondary sources of liquidity. If the Corporation is not able to continue to rely primarily on customer deposits to meet its liquidity and funding needs, continue to access secondary, non-deposit funding sources on favorable terms or otherwise fails to manage its liquidity effectively, the Corporation\u2019s ability to continue to grow may be constrained and the Corporation\u2019s liquidity, operating margins, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity.\"\nLiquidity planning at both the bank and holding company levels has become an area of increased regulatory emphasis.\nDue to regulatory constraints on the Corporation\u2019s ability to rely on short-term borrowings, any significant movements of deposits away from traditional depository accounts which negatively impacts the Corporation\u2019s loan-to-deposit ratio could restrict its ability to achieve growth in loans or require the Corporation to pay higher interest rates on deposit products in order to retain deposits to fund loans.\nLiquidity must also be managed at the holding company level. Banking regulators carefully scrutinize liquidity at the holding company level, in addition to consolidated and bank liquidity levels. For safety and soundness reasons, banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from bank subsidiaries to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends. Generally, these limitations are based on the bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital levels and their net income. These factors have affected some institutions' ability to pay dividends and have required some institutions to establish borrowing facilities at the holding company level.\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or any failure to comply with laws and regulations.\nVirtually every aspect of the Corporation's and its bank subsidiaries\u2019 operations is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulatory agencies. Under this regulatory framework, regulatory agencies have broad authority in carrying out their supervisory, examination and enforcement responsibilities to address compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity and risk management, as well as laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, among other aspects of the Corporation\u2019s business.\nFederal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies continually review banking and other laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in federal or state laws, regulations or governmental policies, including income tax laws, affecting the Corporation and its business, and the effects of such changes, are difficult to predict and may produce unintended consequences. New laws, regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer, alter demand for existing products and services, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, increase compliance burdens, or otherwise adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Corporation has six bank subsidiaries, and the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by a relatively large number of federal and state regulatory agencies. This corporate structure presents challenges, specifically, the need for compliance with different, and potentially inconsistent, regulatory requirements and expectations. The time, expense and internal and external resources associated with regulatory compliance continue to increase, and balancing the need to address regulatory changes and effectively manage overall non-interest expenses has become more challenging than it has been in the past. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s compliance obligations increase the Corporation's expense, require increasing amounts of management's attention and can be a disadvantage from a competitive standpoint with respect to non-regulated competitors and larger bank competitors with more extensive resources.\nThe Corporation has announced that it is developing plans to seek regulatory approval to begin the process of consolidating its six bank subsidiaries. This multi-year consolidation process is expected to eventually result in the Corporation conducting its core banking business through a single bank subsidiary, which would reduce the number of government agencies that regulate the Corporation\u2019s banking operations. The timing of the commencement of this consolidation process will depend significantly on the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries making necessary progress in enhancing a largely centralized compliance program designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA, the Patriot Act and related anti-money laundering regulations (collectively, the \"BSA/AML Requirements\"). The Corporation will also need to establish, to the satisfaction of the Corporation\u2019s banking regulatory agencies, that those enhancements are sustainable to achieve compliance with the regulatory enforcement orders issued to the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries by their respective banking regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in that compliance program. There is no assurance that the regulatory approvals required for such consolidation can be obtained or that such consolidation would significantly reduce the time, expense and internal and external resources associated with regulatory compliance.\nCompliance with banking statutes and regulations is important to the Corporation\u2019s ability to engage in new activities and to consummate certain transactions. Banking regulators are scrutinizing banks through longer and more intensive bank examinations. Federal and state banking agencies possess broad powers to take supervisory actions, as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the Corporation\u2019s operations and expansion activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. As noted below and as examples of such limitations, the regulatory enforcement orders to which the Corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries are subject impose certain restrictions on the expansion activities of the Corporation and such bank subsidiaries.\nIn addition, in September 2016, the CFPB and the OCC entered into a consent order with a large national bank alleging widespread improper sales practices, which prompted the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct a horizontal review of sales practices throughout the banking industry. The elevated attention likely will result in continued additional regulatory scrutiny and regulation of incentive arrangements, which could adversely impact the delivery of services and increase compliance costs.\nFailure to comply with these regulatory requirements, including inadvertent or unintentional violations, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties, or the commencement of further informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries. Other negative consequences can also result from such failures, including regulatory restrictions on the Corporation's activities, including restrictions on the Corporation\u2019s ability to grow through acquisition, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the Corporation's securities, and increases in the Corporation's costs of doing business. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory enforcement orders requiring improvement in compliance functions and remedial actions.\nIn recent years, a combination of financial reform legislation and heightened scrutiny by banking regulators have significantly increased expectations regarding what constitutes an effective risk and compliance management infrastructure. To keep pace with these expectations, the Corporation has invested considerable resources in initiatives designed to strengthen its risk management framework and regulatory compliance programs, including those designed to comply with the BSA/AML Requirements.\nNonetheless, as mentioned above, the Corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory enforcement orders issued during 2014 and 2015 by their respective Federal and state bank regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s centralized BSA and anti-money laundering compliance program (the \u201cBSA/AML Compliance Program\u201d), which was designed to comply with the BSA/AML Requirements.\nThe regulatory enforcement orders, which are in the form of consent orders or orders to cease and desist issued upon consent (the \u201cConsent Orders\u201d), generally require, among other things, that the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries undertake a number of required actions to strengthen and enhance the BSA/AML Compliance Program, and, in some cases, conduct retrospective reviews of past account activity and transactions, as well as certain reports filed in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements, to determine whether suspicious activity and certain transactions in currency were properly identified and reported in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements.\nIn addition to requiring strengthening and enhancement of the BSA/AML Compliance Program, while the Consent Orders remain in effect, the Corporation is subject to certain restrictions on expansion activities, such as growth through acquisition or branching to supplement organic growth of the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries. Further, any failure to comply with the requirements of any of the Consent Orders involving the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries could result in further enforcement actions, the imposition of material restrictions on the activities of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries, or the assessment of fines or penalties.\nAdditional expenses and investments have been incurred as the Corporation expanded its hiring of personnel and use of outside professionals, such as consulting and legal services, and capital investments in operating systems to strengthen and support the BSA/AML Compliance Program, as well as the Corporation\u2019s broader compliance and risk management infrastructures. The expense and capital investment associated with all of these efforts, including in connection with the Consent Orders, have had an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations in recent periods and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations in one or more future periods.\nFinally, due to the existence of the Consent Orders, some counterparties may not be permitted to, due to their internal policies, or may choose not to do business with the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries. Should counterparties upon which the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries rely for the conduct of their business become unwilling to do business with the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely effected.\nWhile the Corporation believes that it has made significant progress in improving its BSA/AML Compliance Program, there is no assurance as to how long the Consent Orders will remain in effect.\nThe Corporation's largest subsidiary, Fulton Bank, is expected to have had total assets of $10 billion or more for four consecutive quarters as of March 31, 2017, which will subject it to additional regulation and increased supervision.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. The Corporation's largest bank subsidiary, Fulton Bank, had $10.7 billion in assets as of December 31, 2016, and had assets of $10 billion or more as of the end of each of the previous two quarters. If Fulton Bank has assets of $10 billion or more as of March 31, 2017, it will become subject to the following:\n\u2022\nSupervion, examination and enforcement jurisdiction by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nAdditional stress testing requirements;\n\u2022\nA modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear the cost of raising the FDIC reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022\nHeightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule; and\n\u2022\nEnhanced bank regulatory supervision as a larger financial institution.\nIn addition, the Corporation\u2019s other bank subsidiaries will also become subject to the supervision, examination and enforcement jurisdiction by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation.\"\nFinancial reform legislation continues to have a significant impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations; however, until more implementing regulations are adopted, the extent to which the legislation will impact the Corporation is uncertain.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010. The scope of the Dodd-Frank Act impacted many aspects of the financial services industry, and the Act required the development and adoption of many regulations, a number of which have not yet been adopted or fully implemented. The delay in the implementation of many of the regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act on the timelines contemplated by such legislation has resulted in a lack of clear regulatory guidance to banks with respect to certain matters. The resulting uncertainty can cause banks to take a cautious approach to certain business initiatives and planning. Additional uncertainty regarding the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act exists due to court decisions and the potential for additional legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Corporation has been impacted, and will likely continue to be in the future, by the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which reduced debit card interchange revenue of banks, and revised FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Corporation has also been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements, risk management, stress testing and regulation under consumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB. Among other things, the CFPB was given rulemaking authority over most providers of consumer financial services in the U.S., examination and enforcement authority over the consumer operations of large banks, as well as interpretive authority with respect to numerous existing consumer financial services regulations. The CFPB began exercising these oversight authorities over the largest banks during 2011. As an independent bureau funded by the FRB, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. These enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws, including practices or acts that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, with respect to all supervised institutions, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is relatively new under the law.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. These final rules prohibit creditors, such as the Corporation's bank subsidiaries, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability to repay, provide certain safe harbor protections for the origination of loans that meet the requirements for a \"qualified mortgage\" and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. These rules may subject the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries to increased potential liability related to their residential loan origination activities, as well as increase costs. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation.\"\nIn May 2016, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would prohibit banks from using a pre-dispute arbitration agreement to block consumer class actions in court and would require banks to insert language into their arbitration agreements reflecting this limitation. The proposed rule would also require banks that use pre-dispute arbitration agreements to submit certain records relating to arbitral proceedings to the CFPB. The proposed rule would generally apply to contracts entered into more than 180 days after the effective date of any final rule. If adopted as proposed, this rule could result in increased litigation and defense costs as plaintiff\u2019s class action firms would feel encouraged to seek clients as class representatives for alleged consumer harm that otherwise would have been the subject to the existing arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. This proposed rule, if adopted, and other CFPB regulations likely will continue to increase the Corporation\u2019s compliance expenses.\nFulton Bank and the Corporation\u2019s other bank subsidiaries are expected to become (as of March 31, 2017) subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB for compliance with the CFPB\u2019s regulations and policies. The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory regimen have yet to be fully determined, however they could result in material adverse effects on the Corporation\u2019s profitability.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and, for the first year since 2010, both Houses of Congress and the White House have majority memberships from the same political party. In recent years, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB, and consideration of significant changes to the federal income tax code. In addition, the new Administration and Congress may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Corporation\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nNegative publicity could damage the Corporation\u2019s reputation and business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to the Corporation's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the Corporation's business. Negative public opinion could result from the Corporation's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory, compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, and from actions taken by government agencies and community organizations in response to that conduct. Because the Corporation conducts the majority of its businesses under the \"Fulton\" brand, negative public opinion about one line of business could affect the Corporation's other lines of businesses.\nFrom time to time the Corporation and its subsidiaries may be the subject of litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings. Adverse outcomes of any such litigation or proceedings may have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and results of operations as well as its reputation.\nMany aspects of the Corporation\u2019s business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, the Corporation and its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies that were acquired). In addition, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. For example, the Corporation is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice in an investigation regarding potential violations of the fair lending laws by Fulton Bank, Fulton Bank of New Jersey, The Columbia Bank and Lafayette Ambassador Bank due to potential lending discrimination on the basis of race and national origin. Like other large financial institutions, the Corporation is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. These matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory actions against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to our business. The Corporation establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. However, the Corporation may still incur legal costs for a matter, even if a reserve has not been established.\nCurrently, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are the subject of regulatory proceedings in the form of the Consent Orders. The Corporation can provide no assurance as to the outcome or resolution of legal or administrative actions, and such actions may result in judgments against us for significant damages or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on our operations. Resolution of these types of matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in the outcomes of litigation and other proceedings.\nThe Corporation is subject to a variety of risks in connection with origination and sale of loans.\nThe Corporation originates residential mortgage loans and other loans, such as loans guaranteed, in part, by the U.S. Small Business Administration, all or portions of which are later sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or agencies, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and other non-government sponsored investors. In connection with such sales, the Corporation makes certain representations and warranties with respect to matters such as the underwriting, origination, documentation or other characteristics of the loans sold. The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan, or to reimburse the purchaser of a loan for any related losses, if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made at the time of the sale, and, in some cases, if there is evidence of borrower fraud, in the event of early payment default by the borrower on the loan, or for other reasons. The Corporation maintains reserves for potential losses on certain loans sold, however, it is possible that losses incurred in connection with loan repurchases and reimbursement payments may be in\nexcess of any applicable reserves, and the Corporation may be required to increase reserves and may sustain additional losses associated with such loan repurchases and reimbursement payments in the future. Increases to the reserves and losses incurred in connection with actual loan repurchases and reimbursement payments in excess of the amount of any applicable reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nSTRATEGIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation is in the process of transforming its business model and this transformation may not be successful.\nThe Corporation historically has followed a \"super-community\" banking strategy under which the Corporation has operated its bank subsidiaries autonomously to maximize the advantages of the community banking model in serving the needs of its customers. Reliance on this model has posed challenges to the Corporation's efforts to manage risk efficiently and effectively through a centralized risk management and compliance function. As a result of these challenges and a desire to refine its business strategy, the Corporation is in the process of transitioning to a business model that is primarily focused on alignment of services with the customer segments the Corporation serves and less oriented to geographic boundaries.\nThe transformation of the Corporation\u2019s business model, which is being implemented over a period of several years, may have some or all of the following unintended effects:\n\u2022\nThe efficiencies sought may not be achieved;\n\u2022\nSome customers may not receive the change in business model in a positive manner, and relationships with these customers may be jeopardized;\n\u2022\nThe changes in organizational structure and the evolution of the Corporation\u2019s culture that will be required to support the transition to the new business model may lead to dissatisfaction among employees which could make it more difficult for the Corporation to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nThe transition to the new business model may create operational and other challenges that are disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\nExpenses will be incurred in the implementation of the new business model, and the implementation process may distract the Corporation from achieving other fundamental business objectives.\nThe Corporation may not be able to achieve its growth plans.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business plan includes the pursuit of profitable growth. Under current economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, profitable growth may be difficult to achieve due to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022\nIn the current, prolonged low interest rate environment, the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin has been compressed, and it is possible that a net interest margin that is lower than historical levels could continue for some time. As a result, income growth will likely need to come from growth in the volume of earning assets, particularly loans, and an increase in non-interest income. However, customer demand and competition could make such income growth difficult to achieve;\n\u2022\nOperating expenses, particularly in the compliance and risk management areas, have been elevated, and such expenses may increase in the near future, as a result of Fulton Bank surpassing the $10 billion in assets threshold; and\n\u2022\nGrowth through acquisition or branching to supplement organic growth is unlikely to occur while the Consent Orders referenced above are in place, due to an inability to obtain the required regulatory approvals.\nThe competition the Corporation faces is significant and may reduce the Corporation's customer base and negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in the market areas served by the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation also competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the mutual funds industry, full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulation than the Corporation is with respect to the products and services they provide and have different cost structures. Some of the Corporation's competitors have greater resources, higher lending limits, lower cost of funds and may offer other services not offered by the Corporation. The Corporation also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside its market areas. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and, as a result, may be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, technology\nhas lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as transferring funds and paying bills.\nCompetition may adversely affect the rates the Corporation pays on deposits and charges on loans, and could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the income generated from those deposits, thereby potentially adversely affecting the Corporation's profitability and its ability to continue to grow. The Corporation's profitability and continued growth depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in the market areas it serves. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Competition.\"\nIf the goodwill that the Corporation has recorded in connection with its acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nIn the past, the Corporation supplemented its internal growth with strategic acquisitions of banks, branches and other financial services companies. If the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company's net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had $530.6 million of goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. The Corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to earnings in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in impairment charges.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the period. A summary of the accounting policies that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, because they require management\u2019s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill, income taxes, and fair value measurements, is set forth in Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and within \"Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nA variety of factors could affect the ultimate values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognized and reported in the Corporation\u2019s financial statements and these ultimate values may differ materially from those determined based on management\u2019s estimates and assumptions. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards from time to time change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements. Further, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions regarding how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Corporation records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, during 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, that will require the recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial assets based on an entity\u2019s current estimate of expected losses over the lifetime of each loan or other financial asset, referred to as the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model, as opposed to current accounting standards, which require recognition of losses on loans and other financial assets only when those losses are \"probable.\" The Corporation\u2019s adoption of this accounting standard, which is required for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, could materially affect the Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses methodology, financial condition, capital levels and results of operations, including expenses the Corporation may incur in implementing this accounting standard.See \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Standards\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational and other risks and the Corporation's framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of human error or fraud by employees and other third parties, intentional and inadvertent misrepresentation by loan applicants, unsatisfactory performance by employees and vendors, clerical and record-keeping errors, computer and telecommunications systems malfunctions or failures and reliance on data that may be faulty or incomplete. In an environment characterized by continual, rapid technological change, as discussed below, when the Corporation introduces new products and services, or makes changes to its information technology systems and\nprocesses, these operational risks are increased. Any of these operational risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk management framework is subject to inherent limitations, and risks may exist, or develop in the future, that the Corporation has not anticipated or identified. If the Corporation's risk management framework proves to be ineffective, the Corporation could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As noted above, the Corporation\u2019s historical decentralized banking strategy further challenges the Corporation's efforts to manage risk efficiently and effectively through a centralized risk management and compliance function.\nThe Corporation\u2019s operational risks include risks associated with third-party vendors and other financial institutions.\nThe Corporation relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations, including, notably, responsibility for the core processing system that services all of the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements could be disruptive to the Corporation\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations. Further, third-party vendor risk management has become a point of regulatory emphasis recently. A failure of the Corporation to follow applicable regulatory guidance in this area could expose the Corporation to regulatory sanctions.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, execution of transactions or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk\" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Corporation interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Corporation.\nAny of these operational or other risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal controls may be ineffective.\nOne critical component of the Corporation\u2019s risk management framework is its system of internal controls. Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporation\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. See Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the Corporation's operations, net income or reputation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is highly dependent on information systems and technology and the ability to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding customers, employees and others on a daily basis. While the Corporation performs some of the functions required to operate its business directly, it also outsources significant business functions, such as processing customer transactions, maintenance of customer-facing websites, including its online banking function, and developing software for new products and services, among others. These relationships require the Corporation to allow third parties to access, store, process and transmit customer information. As a result, the Corporation may be subject to cyber security risks directly, as well as indirectly through the vendors to whom it outsources business functions. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices, as well as cloud computing, may also heighten these and other operational risks. Cyber threats could result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of customer data, unavailability, degradation or denial of service, introduction of computer viruses and other adverse events, causing the Corporation to incur additional costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies). Cyber threats may also subject the Company to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties, all or any of which could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation.\nThe Corporation attempts to reduce its exposure to its vendors\u2019 cyber incidents by performing initial vendor due diligence that is updated periodically for critical vendors, negotiating service level standards with vendors, negotiating for indemnification from vendors for confidentiality and data breaches, and limiting third-party access to the least privileged level necessary to perform outsourced functions, among other things. The Corporation also uses monitoring and preventive controls to detect and respond to cyber threats to its own systems before they become significant. However, there can be no assurance that the measures employed by the Corporation to combat direct or indirect cyber threats will be effective. In addition, because the methods of cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, the Corporation may be unable to implement effective preventive control measures or proactively address these methods. The Corporation\u2019s or a vendor\u2019s failure to promptly identify and counter a cyber attack may result in increased costs and consequences of a successful cyber attack. Although the Corporation maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be inapplicable or otherwise insufficient to cover any or all losses.\nAccount data compromise events at large retailers, health insurers and others in recent years have resulted in heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact the Corporation\u2019s current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which the Corporation is subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict the Corporation\u2019s ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s profitability. The Corporation\u2019s failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation and its brand.\nThe Corporation continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. The costs of new technology, including personnel, can be high, in both absolute and relative terms. Many of the Corporation\u2019s financial institution competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. In addition, new payment services developed and offered by non-bank competitors pose an increasing threat to the traditional payment services offered by financial institutions. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, or effectively deploy new technologies to improve the efficiency of its operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance, given the past pace of change and innovation, that the Corporation\u2019s technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet or continue to meet the needs of the Corporation and the needs of its customers.\nIn addition, advances in technology, as well as changing customer preferences favoring access to the Corporation\u2019s products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of the Corporation\u2019s branch network and other assets. If customers increasingly choose to access the Corporation\u2019s products and services through digital channels, the Corporation may find it necessary to consolidate, close or sell branch locations or restructure its branch network. These actions could lead to losses on assets, expenses to reconfigure branches and the loss of customers in affected markets. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for talented personnel in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense, and the Corporation may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporation\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporation\u2019s markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nAs an example, and as noted above, the Corporation is engaged in an effort to enhance its compliance and risk management functions. Because many of the Corporation\u2019s peers are engaged in similar efforts, the competition for personnel with skills in these areas can be significant and, to the extent that the Corporation is able to attract qualified personnel, the expense associated with hiring and retaining such personnel may be substantial.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S SECURITIES.\nThe Corporation's future growth may require the Corporation to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may be available only at an excessive cost.\nThe Corporation is required by regulatory agencies to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. The Corporation anticipates that current capital levels will satisfy regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. The Corporation, however, may at some point choose to raise additional capital to support future growth. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of the Corporation's control. Accordingly, the Corporation may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to the Corporation, or at all. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to expand operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impacted. In the event of a material decrease in the Corporation's stock price, future issuances of equity securities could result in dilution of existing shareholder interests.\nCapital planning has taken on more importance due to regulatory requirements and the Basel III capital standards.\nConsistent with current regulatory guidance, the Corporation conducts an annual stress test using internal financial data and different economic scenarios provided by the FRB, and reports the results of the stress test to the FRB. The Corporation's board of directors and its senior management are required to consider the results of the annual stress test in the normal course of business, including as part of its capital planning process and the evaluation of the adequacy of its capital. The results of future stress testing processes may lead the Corporation to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components. In addition, the implementation of certain regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Corporation's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those who may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements.\nIn 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies implemented the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, including: (i) minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) increased minimum Tier 1 capital ratio (from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets), (iii) retention of the minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio at 4.00% of average assets and (iv) a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments. As a result of the implementation of the new capital standards, certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, are excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation\u2019s size and are included in Tier 2 capital instead.\nThe fully phased-in capital standards under the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules require banks to maintain more capital than the minimum levels required under former regulatory capital standards. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements began to apply to the Corporation on January 1, 2015. The required minimum capital conservation buffer began to be phased in incrementally on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the federal banking regulators placing limitations or conditions on the activities of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including limiting the ability of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase capital and terminating FDIC deposit insurance. In addition, the failure to comply with the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation's current capital levels met the fully phased-in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffers, as set forth in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.\"\nThe Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue and its ability to make dividend payments, distributions and other payments.\nThe Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries, and depends on the payment of dividends and other payments and distributions from its subsidiaries, principally its bank subsidiaries, for substantially all of its revenues. As a result, the Corporation's ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. There are various regulatory and prudential supervisory restrictions, which may change from time to time, that impact the ability of the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it. There can be no assurance that the Corporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future. If the Corporation does not receive sufficient cash dividends or is unable to borrow from its bank subsidiaries, then the Corporation may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends\nto its shareholders, repurchase its common stock or service its debt obligations. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Loans and Dividends from Subsidiary Banks.\"\nIn addition, as noted above, liquidity and capital planning at both the bank and holding company levels has become an area of increased regulatory emphasis. In recent years, the Corporation has pursued a strategy of capital management under which it has sought to deploy its capital, through stock repurchases, increased regular dividends and special dividends, in a manner that is beneficial to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders. This capital management strategy is subject to regulatory supervision.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\nFitch, Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and DBRS, Inc. continuously evaluate the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiary's long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the Corporation\u2019s and its subsidiaries' control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, the Corporation and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades by any of these credit rating agencies could have a significant and immediate impact on the Corporation's funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. A reduction in the Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could also increase the Corporation's borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\nDowngrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom the Corporation transacts could create the perception that the Corporation's financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. Additionally, the Corporation could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade of other financial institutions. Accordingly, ratings downgrades for other financial institutions could affect the market price of the Corporation's stock and could limit access to or increase its cost of capital.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Corporation's shareholders.\nProvisions of banking laws, Pennsylvania corporate law and of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Corporation or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Corporation. To the extent that these provisions discourage such a transaction, holders of the Corporation's common stock may not have an opportunity to dispose of part or all of their stock at a higher price than that prevailing in the market. These provisions may also adversely affect the market price of the Corporation\u2019s stock. In addition, some of these provisions make it more difficult to remove, and thereby may serve to entrench, the Corporation's incumbent directors and officers, even if their removal would be regarded by some shareholders as desirable.\nCertain provisions of Pennsylvania corporate law applicable to the Corporation and the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions which may be considered to be \"anti-takeover\" in nature because they may have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of control of the Corporation by means of a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or similar transaction. These provisions are intended to protect the Corporation's shareholders by providing a measure of assurance that the Corporation's shareholders will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid and by preventing a successful takeover bidder from exercising its voting control to the detriment of the other shareholders. Certain provisions in the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, taken as a whole, may also discourage a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy solicitation or similar transaction relating to the Corporation's common stock.\nThe ability of a third party to acquire the Corporation is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The BHCA requires any \"bank holding company\" (as defined in that Act) to obtain the approval of the FRB prior to acquiring more than 5% of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the FRB to acquire 10% or more of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 and, under certain circumstances, such approvals are required at an even lower ownership percentage. Any holder of 25% or more of the Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the BHCA. In addition, the delays associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for acquisitions of interests in bank holding companies also tend to make more difficult certain methods of effecting acquisitions. While these provisions do not prohibit an acquisition, they would likely act as deterrents to an unsolicited takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 88197, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FULT"}
