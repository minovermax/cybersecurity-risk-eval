RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some important risk factors that could affect our future financial performance or could cause our future earnings to be lower or our financial condition to be less favorable than we expect. In addition, other risks of which we are not aware, or which we do not believe are material, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nDifficult and unsettled market conditions may affect our profits and loan quality and may continue to do so for an unknown period.\nUnsettled market conditions may increase the likelihood and the severity of adverse effects discussed in the following risk factors, in particular:\n\u00b7\nThere may be less demand for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nCompetition in our industry could intensify as a result of increased consolidation of the banking industry;\n\u00b7\nIt may become more difficult to estimate losses inherent in our loan portfolio;\n\u00b7\nLoan delinquencies and problem assets may increase;\n\u00b7\nCollateral for loans may decline in value, increasing loan to value ratios and reducing our customers\u2019 borrowing power and the security for our loans;\n\u00b7\nDeposits and borrowings may become even more expensive relative to yields on loans and securities, reducing our net interest margin, and making it more difficult to maintain adequate sources of liquidity;\n\u00b7\nAsset based liquidity, which depends upon the marketability of assets such as mortgages, may be reduced; and\n\u00b7\nCompliance with banking regulations enacted in connection with stimulus legislation and other legislation may increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, and impair our ability to hire and retain talented managers.\nChanges in interest rates and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur net income depends to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income and net income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nMarket interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, international events, and events in world financial markets. We attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Changes in the market interest rates for types of products and services in our various markets also may vary significantly from location to location and over time based upon competition and local or regional economic factors. The results of our interest rate sensitivity simulation model depend upon a number of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk.\nChanges in local economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur commercial and commercial real estate lending operations are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City, Stillwater, Edmond, and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Fort Worth, Texas; Hutchinson and Wichita Kansas; and Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our success depends in part upon economic conditions in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthese markets. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could reduce our growth in loans and deposits, impair our ability to collect our loans, increase our problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nAdverse changes in healthcare-related businesses could lead to slower loan growth and higher levels of problem loans and charge-offs.\nWe have approximately $425.7 million in loans to individuals and businesses involved in the healthcare industry, including business and personal loans to physicians, dentists, and other healthcare professionals, and loans to for-profit hospitals, nursing homes, suppliers and other healthcare-related businesses, representing approximately 24% of total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Our strategy calls for continued commitment to healthcare lending. This concentration exposes us to the risk that adverse developments in the healthcare industry could hurt our profitability and financial condition as a result of increased levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs and reduced loan demand and deposit growth.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Educations Reconciliations Act of 2010, is expected to have effects on the provision of healthcare in the United States. We have assessed its potential outcome on the market for healthcare and our services for the healthcare industry, and believe it is too early to conclude the entire impact on them. However, some trends are emerging. We are beginning to see an evolution that favors larger healthcare providers, which is driving many strategic mergers and acquisitions. Also, reimbursement and service provider margins continue to be pressed. The law is complex and implementation requires the adoption of significant regulations. As a result, the new laws could have adverse effects on the growth and profitability of our healthcare business.\nOur market areas are dependent on, and we have credit exposure to, the oil and gas industry.\nThe economy in a large portion of our market areas is dependent on the oil and gas industry. Many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities. Additionally, we are a lender in the energy sector. As of December 31, 2015, we had $96.7 million in loan commitments, of which $63.4 million was funded debt, to borrowers in the oil and gas industry, representing approximately 4% of our total loans outstanding as of that date. As of December 31, 2015, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $37 compared to approximately $53 as of December 31, 2014, and further declined to as low as approximately $27 as of January 20, 2016. While approximately one-third of our funded energy credits have hedges in place through 2016, if oil prices remain at these low levels for an extended period, we could experience weaker energy loan demand and increased losses within our energy portfolio. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have a negative impact on the economies of energy-dominant states such as Oklahoma and Texas. As a result, a prolonged period of low oil prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We have the ability to adjust the borrowing base on outstanding commitments based on market price and condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is appropriate to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that are identified. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Additionally, future additions may be required based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of incorrect assumptions by management in determining the allowance. Federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of our total loan portfolio. These types of loans typically are larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the allowance for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe results of our most recent internal credit stress test may not accurately predict the impact on our financial condition if the economy\u2019s performance is worse than we expect.\nWe perform internal assessments of our capital and asset quality as part of our planning process. Our process includes stress tests using alternative credit quality assumptions in order to estimate their effects on loan loss provisions, net income, and regulatory capital ratios. The alternative assumptions include mild and severe credit quality stress scenarios.\nThe results of these stress tests involve assumptions about the economy, future loan losses and default rates, which may not accurately reflect the impact on our earnings or financial condition or actual future conditions. Actual future economic conditions may result in significantly higher credit losses than we assume in our stress tests, with a corresponding more negative impact on our earnings, financial condition, and capital than those predicted by our internal stress test.\nWe may not realize our deferred tax assets.\nWe may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets based on forecasts of taxable income quarterly. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based on approved business plans, eligible carryforward and carryback periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. and our industry may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred tax assets. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon earnings forecasts and prior period changes, among other things. A significant change in our assumptions could affect the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nOur earnings and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws, or the interpretation of them.\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles could have negative effects on our reported earnings and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws, rules, and regulations, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws, rules, and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental bodies, could affect us in significant and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, among other things. Failure to comply with tax laws, rules, and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and reputation damage.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on third-party services for communications, information systems, and the internet for nearly every spectrum of our business operations. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. We have taken steps designed to improve the security and redundancy of our networks and computer systems and our physical space. Despite these defensive measures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include interruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In some situations, we may not become aware of a cyber incident for some time after it occurs, which could increase our exposure.\nIn the event of a failure in our computer systems, we would rely on our disaster recovery system to keep our business operational. Any unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business efficiently and without significant additional expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds, depositors and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. Bank SNB is subject to regulation and supervision by the Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve. We are subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The burden imposed by federal and state regulations puts banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies.\nChanges in the laws, regulations, and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit our ability to increase or assess fees for services provided, increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect our ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at insured financial institutions up to certain limits. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Economic conditions in the past have contributed to bank failures. The FDIC may increase our deposit insurance costs by increasing regular assessment rates and levying special assessments, which may in the future significantly and adversely affect our net income.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act will likely continue to increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs, may place restrictions on certain products and services, and limit our future capital raising alternatives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made significant, wide-ranging changes in the regulation of the financial services industry that affect all financial institutions, including us. The Dodd-Frank Act is likely to continue to increase our regulatory compliance burden, increase the costs associated with regulatory examinations and compliance measures, and increase other operating costs.\nAmong other things, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the prohibition of paying interest on commercial demand deposits, which may increase our funding costs, and limits the use of new trust preferred securities as regulatory capital. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose regulations may adversely affect our business operations. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the Bureau may also apply to us through the adoption of similar policies by the Federal Reserve.\nSignificant elements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, but implementation of other elements of the Dodd-Frank Act requires additional regulations, some of which have not yet been established.\nExamination reports may include significant findings and assessments about our condition and operations that are not publicly disclosed. Assessments by bank examiners may cause us to increase our publicly reported problem assets and potential problem loans, charge-offs, or provisions for loan losses.\nExaminations by federal regulatory agencies include assessments of risk, financial health, capital adequacy, loan risk, and other factors that federal banking laws do not allow to be publicly disclosed. The assignment of loans to credit risk categories involves judgment and the application of credit policies. In their examinations, federal banking examiners may assign different risk categories to loans than those assigned by management. In that case, we must amend our risk\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncategorizations to match those assigned by the bank examiners, which may result in increases in publicly reported problem and potential problem loans, charge-offs, or provisions for loan losses.\nThe acquisition of banks, bank branches, and other businesses involves risks.\nWe recently acquired Bancshares and in the future we may acquire additional banks, branches or other financial institutions, or other businesses. Although the integration of Bancshares into our operations has been successfully completed, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage any such future acquisitions. The acquisition of banks, bank branches, and other businesses involves risk, including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities, the uncertainties of asset quality assessment, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies with ours, the potential negative effects on our other operations of the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks, businesses, or branches we acquire. Our failure to execute our internal growth strategy or our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.\nWe rely on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our executive management team. In addition, we will continue to depend on our ability to retain and recruit key commercial bankers. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nCompetition may decrease our growth or profits.\nWe compete for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with other banks and other financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and private lenders, many of which have substantially greater resources than ours. Credit unions have federal tax exemptions, which they may take advantage of to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease our net interest margin, may increase our operating costs, and may make it harder for us to compete profitably.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock at times they desire or at prices they find attractive.\nThe overall market and the price of our common stock fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, in addition to those described in the Risk Factors:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nChanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u00b7\nSpeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u00b7\nThe size of the public float of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nRepurchases by us under our stock repurchase program;\n\u00b7\nStrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions, or financings;\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nFuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u00b7\nProposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u00b7\nUnknown, anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u00b7\nDomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nGeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations as a result of general economic instability and recession. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including volatility resulting from reasons unrelated to their performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our future operating results. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate, and there can be no assurance about the levels of the market prices for our common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common shares, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading in our common shares has less liquidity than many other companies quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers for our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future. Additionally, general market forces may have a negative effect on our stock price, independent of factors affecting our stock specifically.\nFuture issuances or sales of our common stock or other securities may dilute the value of our common stock.\nIn many situations, our board of directors has the authority, without any vote of our shareholders, to issue shares of our authorized but unissued stock, including shares authorized and unissued under our 2008 Stock Based Award Plan. In the future, we may issue additional securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock or reduce the market price for our common stock.\nThe sale, or availability for sale, of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by law, contract, and banking agency discretion.\nIn January 2014, our board of directors reinstated quarterly common stock dividends with their approval of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share. This was the first time dividends on our common stock had been declared since 2009. In January 2015, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.06 per share, and in January 2016, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from Bank SNB. The amount of dividends Bank SNB may pay to us is limited by state and federal laws and regulations. We also may decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business. For information regarding our ability to pay dividends, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, \u201cNote 16 Capital Requirements and Regulatory Matters\u201d.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is further limited because the Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit payment of dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by financial holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a financial holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRestrictions on unfriendly acquisitions could prevent a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts that are not approved by our board of directors. The Oklahoma General Corporation Act includes provisions that make our acquisition more difficult. These provisions may prevent a future takeover attempt in which our shareholders otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices. These provisions include supermajority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations and certain provisions relating to meetings of shareholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes the issuance of additional shares without shareholder approval on terms or in circumstances that could deter a future takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 80007, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OKSB"}
