RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.\nRisks Associated With Our Business\nWe have operated at a loss and will likely continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future.\nWe have operated at a loss due to our ongoing expenditures for research and development of our product candidates and for general and administrative purposes, and lack of significant recurring revenues. We incurred a net loss of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 of $450.9 million. We are likely to continue to incur losses unless and until we are able to commercialize aldoxorubicin or one or more of our other existing or possible future product candidates. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development efforts, we are unable to predict when we may become profitable, if at all. If we do not become profitable or are unable to maintain future profitability, the market value of our common stock will be adversely affected.\nBecause we have no source of significant recurring revenue, we must depend on capital raising to sustain our operations, and our ability to raise capital may be severely limited.\nDeveloping products and conducting clinical trials require substantial amounts of capital. To date, we have relied primarily upon proceeds from sales of our equity securities under our \"shelf\" registration statements on Form S-3 filed with the SEC and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations. We will need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nfund development of product candidates based on our LADR\u2122 technology;\n\u25cf\nfinance our general and administrative expenses\n\u25cf\nacquire or license new technologies;\n\u25cf\nprepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend our patent and other proprietary rights; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop and implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to successfully commercialize any product for which we obtain marketing approval and choose to market ourselves.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #10#\nThe depressed market price of our common stock may severely limit our ability to continue to raise capital, because the aggregate or market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, referred to as our \"public float,\" as of the file date of this Annual Report is less than $75 million. As a result, under Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 the aggregate amount of securities that we can offer and sell under our \"shelf\" registration statements in any 12-month period cannot exceed one-third of our public float, or approximately $20.5 million as of March 16, 2018. If our public float increases to $75 million or more, we will no longer be subject to this limitation.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $37.6 million. Under the terms of the loan agreement, however, we are required to maintain cash equal to a minimum of the greater of three months projected cash burn or $10 million. Management believes that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. This estimate is based, in part, upon our currently projected expenditures for 2018 and the first three months of 2019 of approximately $27.8 million (unaudited), which includes approximately $1.5 million (unaudited) for our clinical programs, approximately $3.1 million (unaudited) for pre-clinical development of new high potency cytotoxic albumin-binding cancer drugs, approximately $0.7 million (unaudited) for general operation of its clinical programs, approximately $10.1 million (unaudited) for other general and administrative expenses and $12.4 million of interest and principal payments on our outstanding term loan. These projected expenditures are also based upon numerous other assumptions and subject to many uncertainties, and actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections. While these projections represent our current expected expenditures, we have the ability to reduce the amounts and alter the timing of research and development expenditures as needed to manage its liquidity needs while still advancing its research and development objectives. We will ultimately be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long-term business plans, although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with long term debt or capital. We cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are not successful in negotiating an agreement with a strategic partner to advance at least one lead compound from our Freiburg operations, we may reduce our headcount and discontinue certain development programs and drug discovery activities. For these reasons and others, our operating results may fluctuate from period to period, and the results of prior periods should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval and successfully commercialize aldoxorubicin, or another product candidate, we anticipate it will take a minimum of two years, and likely longer, for us to generate significant recurring revenue, and we will be dependent on future financing until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant recurring revenue. We have no commitments from third parties to provide us with any additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain future financing on favorable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result and new investors could have rights superior to holders of the shares issued in this offering. In addition, debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. If adequate funds are not available to us, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets or to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some portion or all of our development programs or clinical trials. We also may have to license to other companies our product candidates or technologies that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves.\nIf NantCell fails to successfully develop aldoxorubicin or our exclusive licensing arrangement with NantCell is otherwise unsuccessful, our business prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nIn July 2017, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with NantCell to complete the clinical development of and commercialization of aldoxorubicin. Under this agreement, NantCell has committed to provide substantial funding, as well as significant capabilities in clinical development, regulatory affairs, marketing and sales.\nIf, for any reason, NantCell does not devote sufficient time and resources to the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin, we will not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, if NantCell were to breach or terminate its arrangement with us, the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin could be delayed, curtailed or terminated, and we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin on our own.\nUnder our agreement with NantCell, they may opt out of a project by giving us twelve months' prior written notice. If NantCell were to exercise its right to opt out of a program or to terminate the licensing agreement, the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin would be adversely affected, our potential for generating revenue from this program would be adversely affected and attracting new partners would be made more difficult.\nMuch of the potential revenue from our existing and future arrangement with NantCell will consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving development and commercialization milestones and royalties payable on commercial sales of successfully developed aldoxorubicin. The milestone, royalty and other revenue that we may receive under this arrangement will depend upon our, and NantCell's ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell aldoxorubicin. We will not be directly involved in this process and will depend entirely on NantCell, which may fail to develop or effectively commercialize aldoxorubicin because they:\n\u00b7\ndecide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u00b7\ndo not have sufficient resources necessary to carry aldoxorubicin through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization;\n\u00b7\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for aldoxorubicin; or\n\u00b7\ndecide to pursue a competitive drug candidate.\nIf NantCell fails to develop or effectively commercialize aldoxorubicin or for any of the other reasons described above, we may not be able to develop and commercialize that drug independently, or replace NantCell with another suitable partner in a reasonable period of time and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #11#\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we estimate, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. Our financial projections also may prove to be materially inaccurate.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings.\nWe also may disclose projected expenditures or other forecasts for future periods. These and other financial projections are based on management's current expectations and do not contain any margin of error or cushion for any specific uncertainties, or for the uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting.\nThe actual timing of milestones and actual expenditures or other financial results can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet milestones or financial projections as announced from time to time, the development and commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. The assumptions management has used to produce these projections may significantly change or prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any of these financial projections.\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if our products are not successfully developed and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we may be forced to reduce or curtail our operations.\nAll of our product candidates in development must be approved by the FDA or corresponding foreign governmental agencies before they can be marketed. The process for obtaining FDA and foreign government approvals is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. This process typically includes the conduct of extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, including post-approval testing, which may take longer or cost more than we or our licensees, if any, anticipate, and may prove unsuccessful due to numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our product development efforts, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in enrolling patients in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u00b7\nrequirements for clinical trial design imposed by the FDA;\n\u00b7\nunexpected adverse reactions by patients in trials;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in obtaining clinical supplies of the product;\n\u00b7\nchanges in or our inability to comply with FDA or foreign governmental product testing, manufacturing or marketing requirements;\n\u00b7\nregulatory inspections of clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us or our manufacturers or licensees to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate the affected clinical trials if investigators find them not to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ninability to generate statistically significant data confirming the safety and efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u00b7\nmodification of the product during testing; and\n\u00b7\nreallocation of our limited financial and other resources to other clinical programs.\nIt is possible that none of the product candidates we develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them. The time required to obtain FDA and foreign governmental approvals is unpredictable, but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate. Any analysis we perform on data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #12#\nFurthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and good clinical practices, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u00b7\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. We will also be subject to periodic inspections and the potential for mandatory post- approval clinical trials required by the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals or to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular product candidate. The failure to comply with any post-approval regulatory requirements also could result in the rescission of the related regulatory approvals or the suspension of sales of the offending product.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. For example, aldoxorubicin has shown encouraging preliminary clinical results in our Phase 2b clinical trial as a treatment for STS; however, these conclusions may not be reproduced in future clinical trial results; for instance, the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial testing aldoxorubicin as a treatment for STS narrowly missed statistical significance although it demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS over investigator's choice in 312 patients treated in North America plus Australia . Accordingly, our development partner may ultimately be unable to provide the FDA with satisfactory data on clinical safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain FDA approval of aldoxorubicin for any indication.\nFurther, we may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. We do not know whether ongoing clinical trials will be completed on schedule or at all, or whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining institutional review board approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u00b7\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\nadding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #13#\nOur SPA with the FDA for our pivotal study of aldoxorubicin does not guarantee marketing approval in the U.S.\nWe have an SPA with the FDA for the pivotal trial of aldoxorubicin for the treatment of STS. The SPA means that the FDA agrees that the design and analyses proposed in a protocol are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. However, an SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate, and even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution, and analysis proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the sponsor fails to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for the SPA change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts. In addition, even after an SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement. Moreover, a final determination that the agreed-upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy and safety (positive benefit-risk ratio), or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data submitted to the FDA.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we and our collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have agreements with third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely heavily on these parties for execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these CROs fails to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations, and will require a large number of test subjects. Our or our CROs' failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for aldoxorubicin would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects\nWe rely upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical product supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidate, and our commercialization of any product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain approval of the FDA, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture any of our other product candidates, and we lack the resources and capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Accordingly, we are dependent upon third-party manufacturers, or potential future strategic alliance partners, to manufacture these supplies. Our failure to secure arrangements as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our future products or to commercialize them.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be completed after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of aldoxorubicin and are completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the FDA's requirements for manufacture of aldoxorubicin. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the FDA's strict regulatory requirements, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for the manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #14#\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nWe will be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we have rights to valid and enforceable patents or other proprietary rights that cover them. Although we have rights to patents and patent applications directed to our product candidates, these patents and applications may not prevent third parties from developing or commercializing similar or identical technologies. In addition, our patents may be held to be invalid if challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States and in many foreign countries. The application and enforcement of patent laws and regulations in foreign countries is even more uncertain. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively file, protect or defend our proprietary rights on a consistent basis. Many of the patents and patent applications on which we rely were issued or filed by third parties prior to the time we acquired rights to them. The validity, enforceability and ownership of those patents and patent applications may be challenged, and if a court decides that our patents are not valid, we will not have the right to stop others from using our inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents is upheld, a court may refuse to stop others on the ground that their activities do not infringe our patents.\nAny litigation brought by us to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition, make it more difficult for us to enter into strategic alliances with third parties to develop our products, or discourage our existing licensees from continuing their development work on our potential products. If our patent coverage is insufficient to prevent third parties from developing or commercializing similar or identical technologies, the value of our assets is likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also rely on certain proprietary trade secrets and know-how, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets and know-how are difficult to protect. Although we have taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and some of our contractors, it is possible that these persons may disclose our trade secrets or know-how or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets and know-how.\nIf our product candidates infringe the rights of others, we could be subject to expensive litigation or be required to obtain licenses from others to develop or market them.\nOur competitors or others may have patent rights that they choose to assert against us or our licensees, suppliers, customers or potential collaborators. Moreover, we may not know about patents or patent applications that our products would infringe. For example, because patent applications do not publish for at least 18 months, if at all, and can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates would infringe. In addition, if third parties file patent applications or obtain patents claiming technology also claimed by us or our licensors in issued patents or pending applications, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. If third parties file oppositions in foreign countries, we may also have to participate in opposition proceedings in foreign tribunals to defend the patentability of our foreign patent applications.\nIf a third-party claims that we are infringing on its proprietary rights, any of the following may occur:\n\u00b7\nwe may become involved in time-consuming and expensive litigation, even if the claim is without merit;\n\u00b7\nwe may become liable for substantial damages for past infringement if a court decides that our technology infringes a competitor's patent;\n\u00b7\na court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our product without a license from the patent holder, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or which may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and\n\u00b7\nwe may have to redesign our product candidates or technology so that it does not infringe patent rights of others, which may not be possible or commercially feasible.\nIf any of these events occurs, our business and prospects will suffer and the market price of our common stock will likely decline substantially.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies or early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier preclinical trials for our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates, we do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market them in any particular jurisdiction. If our clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for these drug candidates will be adversely impacted and the value of our stock may decline.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #15#\nAny products we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to sell our products that may be approved for marketing primarily to hospitals, which generally receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.\nWe currently expect that any drugs we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician. Under currently applicable law, drugs that are not usually self-administered may be eligible for coverage by the Medicare program if:\n\u00b7\nthey are \"incidental\" to a physician's services;\n\u00b7\nthey are \"reasonable and necessary\" for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standard of medical practice;\n\u00b7\nthey are not excluded as immunizations; and\n\u00b7\nthey have been approved by the FDA.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare program covers certain individuals aged 65 or older, disabled or suffering from end-stage renal disease. The Medicaid program, which varies from state-to-state, covers certain individuals and families who have limited financial means. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nMost third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to cover and reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost-effectiveness and the level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and product candidates.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenues and profitability. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, became law in the United States It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, (i) increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and addresses new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products; (ii) establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and (iii) enacts a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #16#\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recently enacted Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #17#\nWe are subject to intense competition, and we may not compete successfully.\nMany companies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with financial resources, research and development staffs, and facilities that may be substantially greater than those of ours or our strategic partners or licensees, are engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical products that could compete with our potential products. To the extent that we seek to acquire, through license or otherwise, existing or potential new products, we will be competing with numerous other companies, many of which will have substantially greater financial resources, large acquisition and research and development staffs that may give those companies a competitive advantage over us in identifying and evaluating these drug acquisition opportunities. Any products that we acquire will be competing with products marketed by companies that in many cases will have substantially greater marketing resources than we have. The industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and competitors may develop their products more rapidly and such products may be more effective than those currently under development or that may be developed in the future by our strategic partners or licensees. Competitive products for a number of the disease indications that we have targeted are currently being marketed by other parties, and additional competitive products are under development and may also include products currently under development that we are not aware of or products that may be developed in the future.\nAs a result, these competitors may:\n\u00b7\nsucceed in developing competitive products sooner than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u00b7\nobtain FDA or foreign governmental approvals for their products before we can obtain approval of any of our products;\n\u00b7\nobtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit the development and commercialization of our product candidate candidates;\n\u00b7\ndevelop products that are safer or more effective than our products;\n\u00b7\ndevote greater resources than us to marketing or selling products;\n\u00b7\nintroduce or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies and other scientific advances;\n\u00b7\nintroduce products that render our products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nwithstand price competition more successfully than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u00b7\nnegotiate third-party strategic alliances or licensing arrangements more effectively than us; and\n\u00b7\ntake better advantage than us of other opportunities.\nWe will be required to pay substantial milestone and other payments relating to the commercialization of our products.\nThe agreement relating to our worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin provides for our payment of up to an aggregate of $7.5 million upon meeting specified clinical and regulatory milestones up to and including the product's second, final marketing approval. We also will be obliged to pay:\n\u00b7\ncommercially reasonable royalties based on a percentage of net sales (as defined in the agreement);\n\u00b7\na percentage of any non-royalty sub-licensing income (as defined in the agreement); and\n\u00b7\nmilestones of $1,000,000 for each additional final marketing approval that we might obtain.\nUnder the merger agreement by which we acquired Innovive, we agreed to pay the former Innovive stockholders a total of up to approximately $18.3 million of future earnout merger consideration, subject to our achievement of specified net sales under the Innovive license agreements. The earnout merger consideration, if any, will be payable in shares of our common stock, subject to specified conditions, or, at our election, in cash or by a combination of shares of our common stock and cash. Our common stock will be valued for purposes of any future earnout merger consideration based upon the trading price of our common stock at the time the earnout merger consideration is paid.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #18#\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. We maintain sensitive data pertaining to our Company on our computer networks, including information about our development activities, our intellectual property and other proprietary business information. Our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract may be vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, despite the implementation of security measures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions to our operations, including material disruption of our development activities, result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information, and could require substantial expenditures to remedy. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our development programs could be delayed, any of which would harm our business and operations.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities from clinical testing and future product liability claims.\nIf any of our products are alleged to be defective, they may expose us to claims for personal injury by patients in clinical trials of our products or, if we obtain marketing approval and commercialize our products, by patients using our commercially marketed products. Even if one or more of our products is approved by the FDA, users may claim that such products caused unintended adverse effects. We maintain clinical trial insurance for our ongoing clinical trials, and we plan to seek to obtain similar insurance for any other clinical trials that we conduct. We also would seek to obtain product liability insurance covering the commercial marketing of our product candidates. We may not be able to obtain additional insurance, however, and any insurance obtained by us may prove inadequate in the event of a claim against us. Any claims asserted against us also may divert management's attention from our operations, and we may have to incur substantial costs to defend such claims even if they are unsuccessful.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire additional technologies or products. If we require additional technologies or products, our product development plans may change and the ownership interests of our shareholders could be diluted.\nWe may seek to acquire additional technologies by licensing or purchasing such technologies, or through a merger or acquisition of one or more companies that own such technologies. We have no current understanding or agreement to acquire any technologies, however, and we may not be able to identify or successfully acquire any additional technologies. We also may seek to acquire products from third parties that already are being marketed or have been approved for marketing, although we have not currently identified any of these products. We do not have any prior experience in acquiring or marketing products approved for marketing and may need to find third parties to market any products that we might acquire.\nWe have focused our product development efforts on our oncology drug candidates, which we believe have the greatest revenue potential. If we acquire additional technologies or product candidates, we may determine to make further changes to our product development plans and business strategy to capitalize on opportunities presented by the new technologies and product candidates.\nWe may determine to issue shares of our common stock to acquire additional technologies or products or in connection with a merger or acquisition of another company. To the extent we do so, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted accordingly.\nThe impact and results of our exploration of any strategic alternatives are uncertain and may not be successful.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic alternatives available to us to enhance shareholder value. Strategic alternatives could include acquisition transactions and/or strategic partnerships with one or more parties, the licensing of some of our proprietary technologies, or other possible transactions. Any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. Further, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations. We may incur significant costs in connection with seeking certain acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic alternative in the future, there is no assurance that we would fully realize the potential benefits of such a transaction. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable, and acquisition-related integration costs, including certain non-recurring charges, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, integrating assets and businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources, including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. If we fail to successfully integrate any assets and businesses we acquire, we may not fully realize the potential benefits we expect, and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we pay for an acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash available for operations or cause us to incur additional debt, and if we pay with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #19#\nIn the event of a dispute regarding our international drug development, it may be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in the foreign country of dispute, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures.\nThe resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming, similar to the situation in the United States. However, in a foreign country, we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures. We may not be entitled to a jury trial, as we might be in the United States. Further, to litigate in any foreign country, we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws. For these reasons, we may incur unforeseen expenses if we are forced to resolve a dispute in a foreign country.\nDrug discovery is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not succeed in creating new product candidates.\nConducting drug discovery and pre-clinical development of our albumin-binding technology is a complex and expensive process that will take many years. Accordingly, we cannot be sure whether or when our drug discovery and pre-clinical development activities will succeed in developing any new product candidates. In addition, any product candidates that we develop in pre-clinical testing may not demonstrate success in clinical trials required for marketing approval.\nAny deficiency in the design, implementation or oversight of our drug discovery and pre-clinical testing programs could cause us to incur significant additional costs, experience significant delays, prevent us from obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate that may result from these programs or abandon development of certain product candidates. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have a limited operating history in drug discovery, which is inherently risky, and we may not succeed in addressing these risks.\nWe have operated our drug discovery laboratory and LADR\u2122 development program since October 2014. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history in conducting our own drug discovery programs. Consequently, there is limited information for investors to use as basis for assessing the viability of our drug discovery efforts. Investors must consider the risks and difficulties inherent in drug discovery and pre-clinical activities, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties, complications, delays and other unanticipated factors in connection with the development of new drugs;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from companies that have substantially greater assets and financial resources than we have;\n\u00b7\nour ability to anticipate and adapt to a competitive market and rapid technological developments;\n\u00b7\nour need to rely on multiple levels of complex financing agreements with outside funding due to the length of drug development cycles and governmental approved protocols associated with the pharmaceutical industry; and\n\u00b7\nour dependence upon key scientific personnel, including Felix Kratz, Ph.D., our Vice President of Drug Discovery.\nWe cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks or that our drug discovery efforts will be successful. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We also may be required to reduce or discontinue altogether our drug discovery and pre-clinical programs.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \"ownership change\" occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \"5% shareholders\" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. As a result of a previous ownership change, our annual utilization of approximately $136.8 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards will be substantially limited. If we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, we may be further limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any such limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us on any net income that we may earn in the future.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #20#\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nTo raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share that you may pay for the shares of our common stock offered hereby. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share that you may pay for the shares of our common stock.\nWe may experience volatility in our stock price, which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock in 2017 ranged from $1.65 to $6.00 per share, and it may continue to experience significant volatility from time to time. Factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of interim or final results of our clinical trials or our drug discovery activities;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of regulatory developments or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our relationship with our licensors and other strategic partners;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nlitigation involving or affecting us;\n\u00b7\nshortfalls in our actual financial results compared to our guidance or the forecasts of stock market analysts;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in patent or other technology ownership rights;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\npublic concern regarding the safety of our products; and\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulation of drug pricing.\nOur outstanding options and warrants and the availability for resale of the underlying shares may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 2,865,512 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $10.62 per share and outstanding warrants to purchase 3,980,781 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.26 per share. Our outstanding options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions, since the holders of options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we may be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable to us than the terms of outstanding options and warrants. For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Many of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions pertaining to dividends with respect to our common stock. In the event that these anti-dilution provisions are triggered by us in the future, we would likewise be required to reduce the exercise price, and increase the number of shares underlying, those warrants, which would have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe have registered with the SEC the resale by the holders of all or substantially all shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants. The availability of these shares for public resale, as well as actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #21#\nWe cannot assure investors that our internal controls will prevent future material weaknesses.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not suffer from material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic and other reports with the SEC, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nWe are subject to legal actions that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that arise in ordinary course of business. Securities-related class action and derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies such as ours, which often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs.\nAs described further in Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report, our directors and certain of our officers are subject to stockholder derivative claims pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery and we and certain of our officers are subject to class-action complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Although we carry director's and officer's and other liability insurance, we must pay the first legal fees and other litigation expenses incurred up to the application retention, or deductible, amounts under our insurance policies, and the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the liabilities that we may incur in connection with the pending or possible future legal actions. As a result, the pending legal proceedings and any future legal actions may adversely affect out financial condition.\nOur anti-takeover measures may make it more difficult to change our management, or may discourage others from acquiring us, and thereby adversely affect stockholder value.\nWe have a stockholder rights plan and provisions in our restated by-laws, as amended, that are intended to protect our stockholders' interests by encouraging anyone seeking control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors. These provisions may discourage or prevent a person or group from acquiring us without the approval of our board of directors, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have a classified board of directors, which means that at least two stockholder meetings, instead of one, will be required to effect a change in the majority control of our board of directors. This applies to every election of directors, not just an election occurring after a change in control. The classification of our board increases the amount of time it takes to change majority control of our board of directors and may cause potential acquirers to lose interest in a potential purchase of us, regardless of whether our purchase would be beneficial to us or our stockholders. The additional time and cost to change a majority of the members of our board of directors makes it more difficult and may discourage our existing stockholders from seeking to change our existing management in order to change the strategic direction or operational performance of our company.\nOur by-laws provide that directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote at an election of directors. This provision prevents stockholders from removing any incumbent director without cause. Our by-laws also provide that a stockholder must give us at least 120 days notice of a proposal or director nomination that such stockholder desires to present at any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders. Such provision prevents a stockholder from making a proposal or director nomination at a stockholder meeting without us having advance notice of that proposal or director nomination. This could make a change in control more difficult by providing our directors with more time to prepare an opposition to a proposed change in control. By making it more difficult to remove or install new directors, these bylaw provisions may also make our existing management less responsive to the views of our stockholders with respect to our operations and other issues such as management selection and management compensation.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may also prevent or delay a takeover of us that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCytRx 2017 10-K Page #22#\nOur restated by-laws, as amended, designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our by-laws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit our stockholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated by-laws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Because we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment in our common stock except to the extent of any appreciation in the value of our common stock. Our common stock may not appreciate in value, or may decline in value.", "PERMNO": 10838, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CYTR"}
