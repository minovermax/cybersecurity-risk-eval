RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are some of the factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements made by us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. Most of these risks are generally beyond our control. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below, or any such other or additional risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes under Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur business is largely dependent on sales to the nuclear power industry. Any disruption in this industry would have a material adverse effect upon our revenue and profitability.\nIn 2017, 83% of our revenue was from customers in the nuclear power industry (73% in 2016). We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the nuclear power industry for the foreseeable future. Our ability to supply nuclear power plant simulators and related products and services is dependent on the continued operation of nuclear power plants and, to a lesser extent, on the construction of new nuclear power plants. A wide range of factors affect the continued operation and construction of nuclear power plants, including the political and regulatory environment, the availability and cost of alternative means of power generation, the occurrence of future nuclear incidents, such as the one which occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011, and general economic conditions. In addition, demand for our products and services may be affected by changes in the legal and regulatory environment within which the global nuclear power industry operates. Regulatory changes could materially affect demand for our products, the profitability of our service deliveries to nuclear power industry customers, and the overall efficacy of our current business model.\nOur sales to foreign customers expose us to risks associated with operating internationally.\nSales of products and services to end users outside the United States accounted for approximately 19% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 33% of consolidated revenue in 2016. Consequently, our businesses are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u00b7\nexport laws and regulations that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. regulations such as the UK Bribery Act;\n\u00b7\nthe burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards generally, as well as responding to changes in those regulations;\n\u00b7\ncontract award and funding delays;\n\u00b7\npotential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u00b7\npotential difficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations, including costs and potentially limited availability of viable hedging options;\n\u00b7\nimport and export duties and value added or other taxes;\n\u00b7\ntransportation and communication delays and interruptions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties involving strategic alliances and managing foreign sales agents or representatives;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u00b7\npotential military conflicts and political risks.\nWhile we have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of our foreign business, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have revenues greater than 10% from any individual foreign country.\nNuclear Industry Training and Consulting revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the following customers have provided more than 10% of this operating segment's revenues:\nEntergy provided 20.8% and 10.2% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nHyperspring and Absolute may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or is terminated by the customer prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of Hyperspring and Absolute's contracts are typically subject to expiration during each year, and they may lose any of these contracts if they are unable to extend, renew or renegotiate the contracts. The loss of any significant customer would adversely affect our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment's revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur expense levels are based upon our expectations as to future revenue, and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for a revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionate effect on our operating results.\nOur revenue was $70.9 million and $53.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had operating income of $0.2 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including purchasing patterns, timing of new products and enhancements by us and our competitors, and fluctuating global economic conditions. Since our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and includes certain fixed, pre-negotiated, and prepaid costs, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and such revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and may not be a reliable indicator of future revenues or earnings.\nBacklog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract or purchase order to purchase from us which have not yet been delivered or recognized as revenue. Our backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $71.4 million and $73.2 million, respectively. There can be no assurance that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Because of project cancellations or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us or poor project performance could increase the cost associated with a project. Delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce or eliminate the revenues and profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. Reductions in our backlog due to cancellation or modification by a customer or for other reasons may adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Many of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. However, we typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nWe are currently a party to multiple fixed price contracts and will continue to enter into similar contracts in the future. If we are not able to accurately estimate or control costs on such projects, the profitability of such projects could be reduced.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to contracts entered into on a fixed price basis, which allow us to benefit from cost savings, but we carry the burden of cost overruns. If our initial estimates are incorrect regarding our costs of performance under these contracts, or if unanticipated circumstances arise, we could experience cost overruns which would result in reduced profits or even result in net losses on these contracts. Our financial condition is dependent upon our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings or losses caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nUnder time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and are paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based. However, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs even under a time and materials contract.\nOur inability to successfully estimate and manage costs on each of these contract types may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur simulation business is dependent on product innovation and research and development, which costs are incurred prior to realization of revenue for new products and improvements.\nWe believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line, develop new products, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer needs. Our product development activities are aimed at the development and expansion of our library of software modeling tools, the improvement of our display systems and workstation technologies, and the advancement and upgrading of our simulation technology. The life cycles for software modeling tools, graphical user interfaces, and simulation technology are variable and largely determined by competitive pressures and the evolution of software and standards that may be controlled by third parties. Consequently, we will need to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance and expand our capabilities in these areas and to maintain our competitive advantage. We cannot control, and we may be unable to predict accurately, the development and evolution of these competitive pressures and external software and standards.\nWe use derivative instruments in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses and exposure to other risks that negatively impact our net income (loss) and business operational efficiency.\nWe periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign-denominated trade receivables. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a derivative instrument counterparty fails to perform. We attempt to minimize credit exposure by limiting counterparties to internationally recognized financial institutions, but even these counterparties are subject to default and contract risk and this risk is beyond our control. Additionally, we may need or wish to avail ourselves of other forms of hedging or derivative instruments in the future depending on our business needs, and these other types of derivative instruments may be subject to the same and other risk, and may not be available to us on a cost-effective or risk-controlled basis, if at all. The unavailability of viable and cost effective risk management, hedging, or similar instruments now or in the future could adversely impact our business operational efficiency or results.\nWe issue performance, advance payment, and bid bonds in the normal course of our business which could result in financial losses that negatively impact our net income (loss).\nWe may be required to issue performance, advance payment, and bid bonds to our customers and potential customers as a normal part of our business activities. Our customers may have the ability to draw upon these performance bonds in the event we fail to cure a material breach of the contract within 30 days of receiving notice from the customer regarding the nature of the breach. As of December 31, 2017, we had issued advance payment and performance bonds on three contracts totaling $0.9 million, all of which have been cash collateralized; the largest of these performance bonds was for $0.5 million. Although we expect no material breaches to occur on these contracts, if such a breach were to occur and we failed to cure such breach, we could incur a loss of up to $0.9 million.\nWe rely upon our intellectual property rights for the success of our business; however, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate.\nAlthough we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are important to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position, our business depends, in part, on the strength of our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology and information. We rely upon a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark law, contractual arrangements and technical means to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, joint venture and alliance partners, customers and other third parties that are granted access to our proprietary information, and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that we have protected or will be able to protect our proprietary technology and information adequately, that the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary information will be prevented, that others have not or will not develop similar technology or information independently, or, to the extent we own any patents in the future, that others have not or will not be able to design around those future patents. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries in which our products are sold do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement, dilution, or loss could make it more difficult for us to generate revenue from the offer, licensure, and sale of our products and services and could enable third parties to compete with us more effectively.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. This competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace at which our costs increase.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive environments with both domestic and foreign competitors, many of whom have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. The principal factors affecting competition in our industries include price, technological proficiency, ease of system configuration, product reliability, applications expertise, engineering support, local presence and financial stability. We believe competition in the simulation fields may further intensify in the future as a result of advances in technology, consolidations and strategic alliances among competitors, increased costs required to develop new technology and the increasing importance of software content in systems and products. As our business has a significant international component, changes in the value of the dollar could adversely affect our ability to compete internationally and could reduce our profitability on international business opportunities that we do win.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and intend to acquire, companies with compatible or related products. These acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies, which include, among other things:\n\u00b7\npotential exposure to unknown liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies, especially if the acquired operations are geographically distant or culturally different;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management time and attention;\n\u00b7\nfailure to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in adopting and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nloss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and\n\u00b7\npossible dilution to our shareholders.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any of our acquisitions, and if we are not successful, our financial results may be materially impacted.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of or the inability to attract and retain one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting business segment is particularly dependent on key personnel and their key strategic relationships. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. If we are not able to attract and retain key skilled personnel, our business could be harmed.\nA failure to attract and retain technical personnel could reduce our revenue and our operational effectiveness.\nThere is a continuing demand for qualified technical personnel in the industries within which we operate. We believe that our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel. Our design and development efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel. An inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our contract performance or on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.\nThe nuclear power industry, our largest customer group, is associated with a number of hazards which could create significant liabilities.\nOur business could expose us to third party claims with respect to product, environmental and other similar liabilities. Although we have sought protection from these potential liabilities through a variety of legal and contractual provisions as well as through liability insurance, the effectiveness of such protections has not been fully tested. Certain of our products and services are used by the nuclear power industry primarily in operator training. Although our contracts for such products and services typically contain provisions designed to protect us from potential liabilities associated with such use, there can be no assurance that we would not be materially adversely affected by claims or actions which may potentially arise due to factors that may be outside of our direct control.\nCyber security incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cyber security threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cyber security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cyber security incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, loss of intellectual property, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nThird-party claims that we allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services. Third parties may bring claims of infringement against us. Because our software is integrated with our customers' networks and business processes, as well as other software applications, third parties may bring claims of infringement against us, as well as our customers and other software suppliers, if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined.\nClaims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms, if at all, even if they are ultimately adjudicated to have no merit, dismissed, or settled. Defending against claims of infringement may be time-consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, including our management's attention to our business. Furthermore, a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re-engineer some or all of our products. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements. We may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events were to occur, and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we have agreed, and may agree in the future, to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others. Although we carry general liability insurance, our current insurance coverage may not apply to, and likely would not protect us entirely or at all from, liability that may be imposed under any of the types of claims described above.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and foreign laws, regulations and policies. Changes to laws or regulations may require us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more restricted, subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright. Particular risks include regulatory risks arising from federal laws, such as laws regarding export of sensitive technologies or technical information. Our business and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nThe existence of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u00b7\nproviding that our Board of Directors fixes the number of members of the board and fills all vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nproviding for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the right of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\nA sustained decline in the price of our common stock or weaker than forecasted operating results could result in write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets and capitalized software development costs.\nIn conjunction with business acquisitions, we record goodwill and other intangible assets and review their fair value for impairment annually as of December 31, or on an interim basis if impairment indicators are present, such as a significant reduction in our market capitalization, significant declines in operating performance or disruptions to the business that could reduce our future cash flow. On November 14, 2014, we recorded $5.6 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Hyperspring. On September 20, 2017, we recorded $2.8 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of Absolute. We tested our goodwill at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and there was no indication of impairment. We can provide no assurance that we will not have an impairment charge in future periods as the result of changing conditions. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our goodwill.\nWe capitalize certain computer software development costs and, accordingly, the capitalized costs are reported on our balance sheet. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years. On an annual basis, and more frequently as conditions indicate, we assess the status of our development programs and the recoverability of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product. If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs we will write-down these costs to their estimated fair value based on the future undiscounted cash flows. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to operations.\nTreatment of goodwill and capitalized software development costs in the current and future accounting periods may have an impact on the value of the company, results of operations, and price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforward and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or tax liabilities may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.", "PERMNO": 81869, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "GVP"}
