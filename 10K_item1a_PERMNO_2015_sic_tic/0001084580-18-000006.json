{"cik": "1084580", "company": "Jefferies Group LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-01-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nThe following factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. In addition to the specific factors mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism and natural disasters.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRecent legislation and new and pending regulation may significantly affect our business.\nIn recent years, there has been significant legislation and increased regulation affecting the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and certain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nMany of these new laws and rules are the result of commitments made since 2008 by leaders of the nations constituting the Group of Twenty, or G-20, to reduce the systemic risk arising from financial derivatives. Title VII of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations adopted and to be adopted by the SEC and CFTC introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps and security-based swaps and parties that deal in such swaps and security-based swaps. Two of our subsidiaries are provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. We may also register one or more additional subsidiaries as security-based swap dealers with the SEC in the future. Title VII and related impending regulations subject certain swaps and security-based swaps to clearing and exchange trading requirements and subject swap dealers and security-based swap dealers to significant new burdens. We have already incurred significant compliance and operational costs as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and when all the final rules contemplated by Title VII have been implemented, our swap dealer entities will also be subject to mandatory capital and margin requirements that will likely have an effect on our business. While there continues to be uncertainty about the full impact of these changes, we will continue to be subject to a more complex regulatory framework, and will incur costs to comply with new requirements as well as to monitor for compliance in the future.\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) relating to derivatives entered into force during August 2012 and, in common with the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S., introduced certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts including: (i) the mandatory clearing of OTC derivative contracts declared subject to the clearing obligation; (ii) risk mitigation techniques in respect of uncleared OTC derivative contracts, including the mandatory margining of uncleared OTC derivative contracts; and (iii) reporting and record keeping requirements in respect of all derivative contracts. EMIR\u2019s requirements primarily apply to \u201cfinancial counterparties\u201d such as European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) authorized investment firms, credit institutions, insurance companies, UCITs and alternative investment funds managed by EU authorized alternative investment fund managers, and \u201cnon-financial counterparties\u201d (being an EU entity which is not a financial counterparty). EMIR also applies to non-EU regulated entities which transact derivatives with in-scope EU counterparties, if such non-EU regulated entities would be classified as financial counterparties or non-financial counterparties if they were established in the EU. As a result, members of our group who are EU-regulated entities or subsidiaries and, when transacting with in-scope EU counterparties, members of our group who are non-EU regulated entities or subsidiaries may be subject to additional obligations and/or costs that may not otherwise have applied.\nDuring January 2018, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive came into force (collectively referred to as \u201cMiFID II\u201d). MiFID II imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives including new market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements, requirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial instruments (which includes certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way investment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on regulatory sanctions. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions we may be unable to trade shares or derivatives with in-scope counterparties other than as provided by MiFID II. The EU is also currently considering or executing upon significant revisions to laws covering: resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructure; administration of financial benchmarks; credit rating activities; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; remuneration principles and proportionality; new amendments to capital and liquidity standards; disclosures under the Basel regime aiming to increase market transparency and consistency and corporate governance in financial firms.\nIn May 2018, the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation will replace the existing EU Data Protection Directive, and it will have a significant impact on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals, including the requirement for business to self-report personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority and, under certain circumstances, to the affected data subjects, and provide additional rights to individuals whose data is processed, including the \u201cright to erasure\u201d (also commonly known as the right to be forgotten) by having their records erased and the right to data portability. Penalties for non-compliance are also significantly higher, with the maximum fine being the higher of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global turnover for the preceding year. In addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies.\nNegative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act and/or insufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms in other jurisdictions.\nIn addition, the scope, timing and final implementation of regulatory reform is uncertain and could negatively impact our business.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nExtensive regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in every country in which we operate. Firms that engage in securities and derivatives trading, wealth and asset management and investment banking must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.\nEach of our regulators supervises our business activities to monitor compliance with such laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigation or similar reviews. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations and such investigations and similar reviews will not result in adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions and/or fines.\nAny violation of these laws, rules and regulations could subject us to one or more of the following events: civil and criminal liability; sanctions, which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries\u2019 registrations as Registered Investment Advisors or broker-dealers; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors; censures; fines; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements, such as the Net Capital Rule, that could impact various capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of our broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with the Net Capital Rule may restrict our broker-dealers\u2019 ability to engage in capital-intensive activities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, conflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nChanging financial, economic and political conditions could result in decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences.\nAs a global securities and investment banking firm, global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nA market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial, economic or political conditions.\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and investment income from managed funds and losses on our own capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors.\n\u2022\nLimitations on the availability of credit can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.\n\u2022\nNew or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses or on balance sheet items may adversely affect our profits.\n\u2022\nShould one of our customers or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.\nThe referendum held in the U.K. on June 23, 2016 resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the EU. In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU, commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. The uncertainty surrounding the timing, terms and consequences of the U.K.\u2019s exit could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility and adversely affect our businesses, including our revenues from trading and investment banking activities, particularly in Europe, and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate substantial parts of our EU businesses from entities based in the U.K. Upon the U.K. leaving the EU, the regulatory and legal environment that would then exist, and to which our U.K. operations would then be subject, will depend on, in certain respects, the nature of the arrangements the U.K. agreed with the EU and other trading partners. It is highly likely that changes to our legal entity structure and operations in Europe will be required as a result of these arrangements, which might result in a less efficient operating model across our European legal entities. We are in the process of finalizing plans to ensure our continued ability to operate in the U.K. and the EU beyond the expected exit date.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of us or our parent.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation has made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including the taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, limiting interest deductions, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, disallowing certain deductions that had previously been allowed, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. The legislation is highly complex and unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Additionally, the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Thus, the impact of certain aspects of the legislation on us or our parent is currently unclear and could have an adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of us or our parent.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. Our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nA credit-rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our business.\nMaintaining an investment grade credit rating is important to our business and financial condition. If our credit ratings were downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could adversely affect our client relationships. Additionally, we intend to access the capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a decrease in our credit ratings or outlook could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact the prices of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss.\nA considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high yield, international, convertible, and equity securities, loans and futures and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nWe are exposed to market risk.\nWe are, directly and indirectly, affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread, the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for sources of funding, which, in turn, impacts our net interest revenue and earnings. Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. In our brokerage operations, a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread. Conversely, in those operations, a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings, corporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSee Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management within Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limit reflects our risk tolerance for a certain activity. Our framework includes inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital and performance analysis. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management within Part II. Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. While we employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent for liquidity from payments from our subsidiaries, many of which are subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulation that restrict dividend payments or reduce the availability of the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAll aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of bank holding companies and commercial banks, other broker-dealers, investment banking firms and other financial institutions. In addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition involve market focus, reputation, the abilities of professional personnel, transaction execution abilities, relative prices of the products and services being offered, bundling of products and services and the quality of products and service. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business.\nOur ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee\u2019s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee\u2019s decision to join us. As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur information and technology systems are critical components of our business and operations, and a failure of those systems or other aspects of our operations infrastructure may disrupt our business, cause financial loss, increase our legal liability and constrain our growth.\nOur business and operations rely extensively on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and devote significant resources to maintaining and upgrading our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion and detection prevention systems, monitoring firewalls to safeguard critical business applications and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, if a client\u2019s computer system, network or other technology is compromised by unauthorized access, we may face losses or other adverse consequences by unknowingly entering into unauthorized transactions. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, such events may cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, including the transmission and execution of unauthorized transactions. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not covered or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as well as cloud computing may also heighten these and other operational risks. Similar to other firms, we and our third party providers continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses and malware, and cyber attacks designed to disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage and denial of service. Additional challenges are posed by external parties, including foreign state actors. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future or could occur more frequently and on a larger scale.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others. Any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk.\nIn the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even when transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.\nWe expect the growth of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that our financial controls, the level and knowledge of our personnel, our operational abilities, our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and our growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nCertain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which we conduct our business activities and the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our business, including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability to us. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur financial instruments, including certain trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, investments, including certain loans and private equity investments, among other items, require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means, which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment. Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods.", "PERMNO": 86804, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LUK2"}
