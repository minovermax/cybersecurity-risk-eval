{"cik": "1076930", "company": "NOVANTA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses and levels of business activities.\nA large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers\u2019 need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers\u2019 financial condition and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. In particular, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in Europe as Britain negotiates the terms of its withdrawal from the EU, and ongoing related negotiations, as well as political and economic uncertainty in the U.S. adversely impacted our customers\u2019 financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels, and have reduced the demand for our products in 2019. Continued or worsening conditions in these or other markets could further reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur business depends significantly upon our customers\u2019 capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations.\nCertain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment markets, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products.\nWe have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, in 2019, our sales into the advanced industrial end market declined as a result of a wide spread downturn in this end market that is continuing. We cannot predict when slowdowns will recur or that the impact of such slowdowns will be more or less significant compared to historical fluctuations.\nOur business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility toward future business declines.\nDuring a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand could prompt customers to look for alternative sources of supply or leave our customers without a supply, both of which events could harm our reputation and make it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn periods of weak demand, we may be required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase or manufacture inventories of products that we are unable to sell.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate and to manage transitions to new product innovations.\nTechnology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers\u2019 requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business.\nWe cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. If any of our new or enhanced products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, or if our competitors release similar products or enhancements at the same time that are more widely accepted by our customers, our revenue and results of operations for one or more reporting periods could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nOur research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanging product specifications and customer requirements;\n\u2022\ninability to manufacture new products cost effectively;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations;\n\u2022\nchanging market or competitive product requirements; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated engineering complexities.\nNew products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, and may have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be difficulty in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful. Any of these adverse developments could lead to loss of market share and inability to achieve our anticipated revenue growth targets.\nCustomer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period.\nChanges in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our customers\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\ntiming and recognition of revenues from customer orders;\n\u2022\ntiming and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\navailability of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors;\n\u2022\ndecisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prices of our products or of our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe received in the past, and may receive in the future, several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers\u2019 businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods.\nDelays in shipments near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period.\nIn addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nAs a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial, customer and employee information. Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions. Certain other events could also result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement action, or other liability risks that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our information technology systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security of our information technology systems, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws, regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nLegislation in various countries around the world with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection is rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, has caused more stringent data protection requirements in the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects how their personal information is to be used; imposes limitations on retention of personal data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we have business operations or are otherwise subject to the GDPR. Certain breaches of the GDPR requirements could result in substantial fines, which can be up to four percent of worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well as potential civil claims, including class action type litigation where individuals suffered harm. Similarly, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Any liability from our failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our GDPR compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts in general. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR or other applicable regimes.\nAs we transact a portion of our sales, and maintain significant cash balances, in foreign currencies, changes in interest rates, credit ratings or foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U. S., the U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds or Japanese Yen, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors.\nAdditionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks.\nOur reliance on international operations in foreign countries subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 59% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping costs;\n\u2022\nlonger customer payment cycles;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nuse of incompatible systems and equipment;\n\u2022\nproblems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures;\n\u2022\ntrade tariffs;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers and export/import controls;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ngovernment currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations, including those that potentially conflict with other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe impact of recessionary foreign economies; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, wars, health epidemics and acts of terrorism.\nWe also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct, which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws.\nOur facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as health epidemics.\nWe may be impacted by health epidemics or other events outside of our control. For example, beginning in late 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus surfaced in China. In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern,\u201d prompting precautionary government-imposed travel restrictions and temporary closures of business operations. We have manufacturing, sales, and service offices in China and has significant direct and indirect customer exposure and supply chain exposure to the China market. Our facility in Suzhou, China was closed for a brief period of time as a result of a local government mandate, before it reopened in February 2020. The business interruption has negatively impacted our near-term results and may negatively impact our long-term results, depending on the length of the disruption. These disruptions have come in the form of part shortages related to our supply chain, labor shortages, and disruptions in demand from our customers in and outside of China, which will negatively affect our revenue and profitability. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty\nrelating to the extent of the impact of the novel coronavirus on our business and potential impacts on our business in the future. Infections may become more widespread, including to other countries where we have operations, and factory closures and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which would worsen the negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the U.S. leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business.\nWe are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China, Southeast Asia and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries and public health crises could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products, or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property.\nIncreases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 59% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. We also manufacture certain of our products and purchase a portion of our raw materials and components from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and other countries have escalated in recent years. U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are or were subject to these tariffs, which has increased our manufacturing costs and could make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been and may in the future be subject to retaliatory tariffs in China, which increases our cost and makes our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. In addition, the U.S. administration previously threatened to impose tariffs on all products imported from China, which would impact all of our products and supplies imported from China to the U.S.; and the Chinese government threatened to levy additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods. If these were to occur, we may not be able to mitigate the impacts of these tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain other foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making our products uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Although a temporary agreement has been reached between the U.S. and Chinese governments to cease further escalation of trade tariffs, there is no guarantee that any of the existing tariffs will be repealed or reduced. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and the actions of the current U.S. government may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of our common shares.\nWe are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations in the U.K., Germany and China. Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the U.K. government, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period during which it will continue its ongoing and complex negotiations with the European Union relating to the future trading relationship between the parties. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before the withdrawal, as well as about the possibility that a so-called \u201cno deal\u201d separation will occur if negotiations are not completed by the end of the transition period. These developments in turn may increase our costs and inhibit our sales of products, mobility of our personnel and our access to capital.\nThe policies of the current U.S. government regarding U.S. trade, tax and health care policies, among other things, have led to substantial uncertainty in global financial markets. The current U.S. government has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, has re-negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and has made various comments suggesting the possible re-negotiation of, or withdrawal from, other trade agreements, has imposed significant tariffs on imports from China and other countries, and has suggested the potential imposition of other significant new import barriers. The current U.S. government has also enacted comprehensive tax law reform and attempted to repeal the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), and may continue to seek repeal of the PPACA. These developments and the lack of clarity regarding future U.S. tax, trade and health care policies have created significant uncertainty that could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any major changes in these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares. Because of the global nature of our business, and our strategy to increase our sales to the medical market, our business may be particularly impacted by any major changes in U.S. trade, tax and health care policies.\nOthers may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights.\nOur future success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any application filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources.\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors.\nOur operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties.\nWe have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. If a successful claim were brought against us and we were found to have infringed a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences.\nSome of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change, Ingenia, Zettlex, WOM, Laser Quantum and ThingMagic, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management\u2019s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team.\nFurther, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate operations into our businesses. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their\nprofitability, in which case our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIf we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales.\nWe have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expenses and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings. We may need to take additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions for a variety of reasons, including deterioration in global economic conditions or significant declines in demand for our products. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results.\nProduct defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors\u2019 products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation.\nWe produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation.\nIn addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors\u2019 products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nThe production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single source of supply. If a single source supplier decides to stop producing a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is otherwise delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such decisions or delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nWe use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on multiple factors, including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers.\nProduction difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. If production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were disrupted by a natural disaster, health epidemic, and act of terrorism or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of:\n\u2022\nmistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations;\n\u2022\nchanging process technologies;\n\u2022\nramping production;\n\u2022\ninstalling new equipment at our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nimplementing new information technology systems;\n\u2022\nshortage of key components; and\n\u2022\nloss of electricity or employees\u2019 access to the manufacturing facilities due to man-made and natural disasters.\nFrom time to time, we determine to consolidate certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping delays, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the key package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers.\nWe are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.\nSome of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive) and to obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant period of time;\n\u2022\nrequire substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\nrequire changes to products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products.\nIn addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.\nIn addition, on April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (the \u201cMDR\u201d) which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. As the MDR becomes effective on May 25, 2020, new medical devices will have to meet requirements of the MDR in order to be placed in the European market after the effective date. Devices holding a certificate from a European Notified Body under the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) have an additional grace period and may continue to be placed on the market until May 26, 2024. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, the regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d) for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will, however, only become applicable three years after publication. Once applicable, the new regulations will, among other things:\n\u2022\nstrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022\nestablish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022\nimprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022\nset up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u2022\nstrengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nWe face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and EU competent authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years.\nThe FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes \"off-label\" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements.\nRegulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future changes. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our\nproducts. Any new statutes, regulations, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs, lengthen regulatory review time for, or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of our products. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval, changes to manufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products, or require additional record keeping.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and operations are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties.\nOur products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sale, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPPA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician \u201cSunshine Act\u201d requirements under PPACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicated Services (the \u201cCMS\u201d) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nOur business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products.\nSeveral of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurs, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results.\nIn addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. Various elements of healthcare reforms, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may have material adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in government regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed.\nWe are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could result in significant costs.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or the recycling of products we manufacture. We are subject to regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to regulatory fines.\nFuture developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on centralized information systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become familiar with the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information\nto key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of upgrades and new ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $440.9 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets.\nAdverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCustomers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers\u2019 failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition.\nOur reliance upon third party distribution channels subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control.\nWe sell many of our products through resellers, distributors, and system integrators. As these third parties tend to have more limited financial resources than OEM and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk. Any downturn in the business of our resellers, distributors, and systems integrators would in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales also depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Taxes\nNovanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation.\nNovanta, Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta, Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends, royalties and certain types of interest.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, and/or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure\nWe may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, maintaining or expanding research and development projects, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt of $224.6 million under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cThird Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) and $226.6 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares.\nOur existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $224.6 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, changes in the general economic environment, and market changes in the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder.\nThe market price for our common shares may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nconditions in the markets we serve; or\n\u2022\ngeneral market, political or economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nRisks Relating to Our Internal Controls\nIf we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business.\nWhile our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company\u2019s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take for our recently acquired businesses or any businesses that we may acquire in the future. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls in order to make such improvements. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources, including management time and attention, from other activities.", "PERMNO": 82261, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "NOVT"}
