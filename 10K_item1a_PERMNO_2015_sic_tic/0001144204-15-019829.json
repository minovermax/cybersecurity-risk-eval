{"cik": "1000683", "company": "BLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The following \u201cRisk Factors\u201d highlight some of these risks. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company now deems immaterial may also affect the Company and the value of its Common Stock. The risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Solely for purposes of the risk factors in this Item 1A, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nAny substantial decrease in sales to our largest customers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2014 and 2013, sales to Toner Cable Equipment Inc. accounted for approximately 16% and 22% of our revenues, respectively. In addition, a major electronics retailer accounted for 16% of our revenues in 2014. Also, Bright House Networks accounted for 12% of our revenues in 2014. Further, sales to XRS Corporation accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues in 2013. There can be no assurance that any sales to these customers will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. As disclosed above in \u201cBusiness - Introduction - Recent Developments,\u201d XRS Corporation has redesigned its product and we were not successful in our bid to win the initial contract for the manufacture of such product. In addition, we do not expect to have recurring sales to Bright House Networks and the major electronics retailer at these levels in the long-term. We anticipate, however, that Toner Cable will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods, although they are not obligated to purchase any specified amount of products (beyond outstanding purchase orders) or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period.\nWith respect to our direct sales to system integrators, the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better-financed integrators grow more rapidly than others. Our success with those customers will depend in part on:\n\u2022 the viability of those customers;\n\u2022 our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects; and\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers.\nApproximately 59% of our revenues in 2014 were derived from sales to our five largest customers. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our leading customers, the financial failure of any of these entities, their inability to pay their trade accounts owing to us, or our inability to develop solid relationships with integrators that may replace the present leading customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn inability to reduce expenses or increase revenues may cause continued net losses.\nWe have had annual net losses each year since 2010, including a net loss of $902,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. In 2014, our net sales revenue of $29.1 million, less cost of goods sold of $18.2 million, did not cover our operating expenses of approximately $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. While management believes its plan to reduce expenses and increase revenues will improve profitability, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. Failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually analyze our slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices, we establish reserves. If we do not meet our sales expectations, these reserves are increased. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value. Although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value, there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future. Significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn inability to develop, or acquire the rights to technology, products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability.\nBoth the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. To be successful, we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs, through the timely development and introduction of new products, enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties. This is particularly true at this time as the Company must develop and market new digital products to offset the continuing decline in demand for, and therefore sales of, analog products. Although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products, we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and/or cost-effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own, or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party. There can, however, be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us. There can be no assurance that:\n\u2022 we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally;\n\u2022 we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs;\n\u2022 technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed; or\n\u2022 successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance.\nIf we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAnticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll aspects of our business are highly competitive. We compete with national, regional and local manufacturers and distributors, including companies larger than us, which have substantially greater resources. Various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace. Because of the convergence of the cable, telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development, new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us. Many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we have. We expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through:\n\u2022 price reductions;\n\u2022 loss of market share;\n\u2022 delays in the timing of customer orders; and\n\u2022 an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market.\nOur sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the cable infrastructure operators that we serve in the MDU, lodging and institutional cable markets.\nThe vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 came from sales of our products for use by cable infrastructure operators. Demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading their systems. Capital spending by private cable operators and, therefore, our sales and profitability, are dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures;\n\u2022 demand for their cable services;\n\u2022 availability of alternative video delivery technologies; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions.\nIn addition, our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over-build existing cable system infrastructures, or constructing, rebuilding, maintaining and upgrading their systems. There can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining, or upgrading their systems. Any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions.\nDuring 2014 and 2013, the U.S. economy continued to feel the effects of the significant economic downturn that began in 2008, resulting in elevated levels of financial market volatility, customer uncertainty and widespread concerns about the U.S. and world economies. The macroeconomic environment and recovery from this downturn has been challenging and inconsistent. The ongoing effects of these circumstances may continue to negatively impact the demand for our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the economic crisis has had a material and direct impact on financial institutions, resulting in tighter credit standards, giving rise to a deterioration of liquidity in the capital markets, particularly as it relates to the credit needs of smaller companies that have faced challenges during this period. This liquidity crunch could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers to borrow funds to support operations or other liquidity needs (including the ability to finance capital expenditures) or otherwise borrow or raise capital. Moreover, our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business, financial condition or results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn.\nThe terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operating and financial flexibility and could adversely affect our financial and operational results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $5.1 million of outstanding debt under our Santander Financing, which is scheduled to expire on February 1, 2016. While we anticipate extending or refinancing all or a portion of this debt obligation on or before February 1, 2016, there can be no assurances that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions. Our inability to refinance our debt obligation on acceptable terms (or at all) would likely have a material adverse on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Santander Agreement that is in effect with respect to this debt includes covenants that, among other things, may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022 engage in mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions;\n\u2022 redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022 create, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 create, incur, assume or permit any liens on any asset;\n\u2022 make loans and investments;\n\u2022 issue additional shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022 change our organizational documents; and\n\u2022 change the nature of our business.\nThese restriction may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, the Santander Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. From time to time during the past two years, we have been unable to meet certain of such financial covenants and we may be unable to comply with certain of such covenants under our credit agreement in the future. Previously, the bank has permitted us to amend the Santander Agreement as it relates to such financial covenants when it appears that we may not be able to meet them, but no assurance can be given that the bank will permit further amendments or provide waivers of these requirements if we are unable to meet them in the future. Accordingly, a failure to comply with the financial covenants under the Santander Agreement could result in an event of default. In the event of a default our lender could elect to declare all borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees outstanding, due and payable, and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, which would likely have a material adverse on our results of operations and financial condition. See also the discussion regarding a material decrease in our liquidity in the first quarter of 2015 in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nAny significant casualty to our facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations.\nWe primarily operate out of one manufacturing facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the \u201cOld Bridge Facility\u201d). While we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance, a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of our ability to manufacture at, or otherwise use, the Old Bridge Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices.\nWe purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by:\n\u2022 an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components;\n\u2022 our receipt of a significant number of defective components;\n\u2022 an increase in component prices; or\n\u2022 our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products.\nOur contract manufacturing in the PRC may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political, regulatory, legal and labor conditions in the PRC.\nWe manufacture and assemble some of our products in the PRC, under a contract manufacturing arrangement with a certain key Chinese manufacturer. Our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to, or any other problems arising from, having our products manufactured in the PRC, including the following risks:\n\u2022 political, economic and labor instability;\n\u2022 changes in foreign or United States government laws and regulations, including exchange control regulations;\n\u2022 increased costs related to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 infringement of our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 difficulties in managing foreign manufacturing operations.\nAlthough the PRC has a large economy, its potential economic, political, legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks. In the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to manufacture in the PRC after products have been successfully transitioned out of the United States, our business could suffer.\nShifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense.\nOver time we may shift additional portions of our manufacturing operations to the PRC in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency. This could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future, which in turn could entail significant one-time earnings charges to account for severance, equipment write-offs or write downs and moving expenses.\nOur earnings would be reduced if our goodwill or intangible assets recorded as part of the RLD Acquisition were to become impaired.\nWe recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as part of the RLD Acquisition in February 2012. Goodwill is generated when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We also have certain intangible assets with indefinite lives. We assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If our goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the RLD Acquisition were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill or intangible assets would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity.\nWe may face risks relating to currency fluctuations and currency exchange.\nHistorically the Company has had limited exposure to currency fluctuations since transactions with customers located outside the United States have generally been denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result of the RLD Acquisition, however, the Company recognized sales in Canada in 2014 and 2013, denominated in Canadian Dollars and anticipates that it will continue to recognize sales in Canada denominated in Canadian Dollars in future periods. The Company incurs certain expenses which are denominated in Canadian Dollars in connection with its sales and product distribution in Canada. The Company's functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, any revenue and expense denominated in Canadian Dollars needs to be translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. We do not engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. The Company anticipates that sales in Canada during 2015 should be less than $2,000,000. Currency fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nCompetitors may develop products that are similar to, and compete with, our products due to our limited proprietary protection.\nWe possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology. We rely on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know-how. There can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Therefore, existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products. Such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent infringement claims against us or our customers, whether or not successful, may cause us to incur significant costs.\nWhile we do not believe that our products (including products and technologies licensed from others) infringe valid intellectual property rights of any third parties, there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or our customers. Damages for infringement of valid intellectual property rights of third parties could be substantial, and if determined to be willful, can be trebled. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation. Regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers, we could seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance, however, that under such circumstances, a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all. The failure to obtain a license to a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2012, K Tech Telecommunications, Inc. (\u201cK Tech\u201d) filed a patent infringement claim against the Company and RLD seeking an injunction and damages, as described in more detail below under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nAny increase in governmental regulation of the markets that we serve, including the cable television system, MDU, lodging and institutional markets, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cable television, MDU, lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry, which represents the vast majority of our business, while in some cases subject to certain FCC licensing requirements, is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations. It is possible, however, that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on these markets resulting in, among other things, barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures. Any such regulations, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivate cable system operation is not presently burdened with significant government regulation, other than, in some cases, certain FCC licensing and signal leakage requirements. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries. It is possible, however, that regulations could be adopted which would re-impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in, among other things, the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas. Any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending 2015 for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us. Further, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations. Any failure by us to obtain required permits for, control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended. Such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLosing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees, or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees, could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering, manufacturing, marketing and managerial personnel. The competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees, in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Common Stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock, to determine the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated Preferred Stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The Preferred Stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the Common Stock. Furthermore, such Preferred Stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to the Common Stock, and as a result, the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation:\n\u2022 eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting;\n\u2022 does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u2022 does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings;\n\u2022 provides for a classified board of directors; and\n\u2022 imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions.\nThese provisions and the Board\u2019s ability to issue Preferred Stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire our company, preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Common Stock, or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company. We are also afforded the protection of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could:\n\u2022 delay or prevent a change in control of our company;\n\u2022 impede a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022 discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nAny of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our Common Stock.\nIt is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our loan agreement with Santander Bank, N.A. prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded and subject to volatility, which may adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock.\nAlthough our Common Stock is traded on the NYSE MKT, it may remain relatively illiquid, or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d which can increase share price volatility and make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares in the public market without materially affecting the quoted share price. Investors may be unable to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.\nThe prevailing market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our competitors or third parties;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations;\n\u2022 failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations;\n\u2022 market conditions for cable industry stocks in general; and\n\u2022 broader market trends unrelated to our performance.\nOur share ownership is highly concentrated.\nOur directors and officers beneficially own or have the rights to vote approximately 47% of our Common Stock and will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors.\nDelays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement or other difficulties in our relationship with our union employees may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations.\nAll of our direct labor employees located at the Old Bridge, New Jersey facility are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, Local 2066 (the \u201cUnion\u201d), under a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in February 2017. In connection with any renewal or renegotiation of the labor agreement upon its termination, there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur or that we will be able to agree upon terms for future agreements with the Union. Any work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. Our systems are designed to detect security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property, confidential business or personal information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees\u2019, licensees\u2019, or customers\u2019 confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.", "PERMNO": 82768, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "BDR"}
