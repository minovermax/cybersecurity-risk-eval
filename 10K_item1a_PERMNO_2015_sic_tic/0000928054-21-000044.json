{"cik": "928054", "company": "FLOTEK INDUSTRIES INC/CN/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Readers of this Annual Report should not consider any descriptions of these risk factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Company. These factors should be carefully considered together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and the other reports and materials filed by the Company with the SEC. Further,\nmany of these risks are interrelated and, as a result, the occurrence of certain risks could trigger and/or exacerbate other risks. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or liquidity.\nThis Annual Report contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements discuss Company prospects, expected revenue, expenses and profits, strategic and operational initiatives, and other activities. Forward-looking statements also contain suppositions regarding future oil and natural gas industry and other conditions, both domestically and internationally. The Company\u2019s results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including risks described below and elsewhere. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s business is largely dependent upon its customers\u2019 spending, both in the oil and gas industry and in the sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant sector. Spending could be adversely affected by industry conditions or by new or increased governmental regulations; global economic conditions; spending on sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant products; sentiment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic; the availability of credit; and oil and natural gas prices.\nThe Company\u2019s CT and DA segments are dependent upon customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures and purchasing decisions related to the Company\u2019s products. Expectations of a decline in future oil and natural gas market prices or lessened focus on sanitation chemicals could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which the Company has no control, including the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and international economic conditions, availability and effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine, general focus on sanitization and cleansing, and mergers and divestitures among the Company\u2019s target customer base.\nDemand for and prices of the Company\u2019s products are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022global demand for energy as a result of population growth, economic development, and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022the timing and rate of economic recovery from the effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022the need for sanitization products related to concern over COVID-19 and similar diseases and related consumer behavior;\n\u2022the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and the impact of non-OPEC producers on global supply;\n\u2022availability and quantity of natural gas storage;\n\u2022import and export volumes and pricing of liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022domestic and international refining activity;\n\u2022availability of vaccines and other therapeutic treatments for COVID-19;\n\u2022pipeline capacity to critical markets and out of producing regions;\n\u2022political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;\n\u2022cost of exploration, production and transport of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022technological advances impacting energy production and consumption; and\n\u2022weather conditions.\nThe volatility of commodity prices and the consequential effect on the activities of the Company\u2019s target customer base could adversely impact the activity levels of the Company\u2019s customers.\nVolatile economic conditions could weaken customer expenditures, causing reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results. It is difficult to predict the pace of industry growth, the direction of oil and natural gas prices, the direction and magnitude of economic activity, the effects or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant products, and to what extent these conditions could affect the Company. However, reduced cash flow and capital availability could adversely impact the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers, which could result in customer project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to the Company. This could cause a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, if certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers were to experience significant cash flow constraints or become insolvent as a result of such conditions, a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could occur, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services and may continue to have a prolonged material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant and continued reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. These effects have materially and adversely affected, and may continue to materially and adversely affect, the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our oil and gas related services and products. The decline in our customers\u2019 demand for our oil and gas related services and products has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we have adopted social distancing and work-from-home procedures, which have had and may continue to have an impact on the ability of employees and management of the Company to communicate and work efficiently. We expect such impact will continue to have certain negative effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe timing of the effectiveness of vaccines, economic uncertainty, and future developments and effects are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity and/or capital levels.\nReduced unconventional oil production could lessen the positive effects of a general recovery of the oil and gas industry.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s product offerings in its CT segment, other than sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant products, are used in unconventional oil and gas operations. The Company has little to no exposure to conventional or offshore sectors. In the event that an industry recovery is disproportionately driven by conventional and offshore oil and gas operations, the Company may not have a resulting increase in its operational results.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to develop and/or introduce new products or differentiate existing products could have an adverse effect on its ability to be responsive to customers\u2019 needs and could result in a loss of customers, as well as adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future success and profitability.\nThe industries in which the Company does business are characterized by technological advancements that have historically resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the scope and quality of specialty chemistries and analytical services. Consequently, the Company\u2019s future success is dependent, in part, upon the Company\u2019s continued ability to timely develop innovative products and services. Successful introduction of new technology requires time and resources, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to commercialize new technology in a timely manner. If the Company fails to successfully develop and introduce innovative products and services that appeal to customers, or if existing or new market competitors develop superior products and services, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could deteriorate. The Company develops, markets and produces certain green alternatives to many existing products. If these green alternatives do not perform as well as existing conventional products, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIncreased competition could exert downward pressure on prices charged for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nThe Company operates in a competitive environment characterized by large and small competitors. Competitors with greater resources and lower cost structures or who are trying to gain market share may be successful in providing competing products and services to the Company\u2019s customers at lower prices than the Company currently charges. Employees of the Company may leave and compete directly with the Company. This may require the Company to lower its prices, resulting in an adverse impact on revenues, margins, and operating results. Thus, competition could have a detrimental impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company is unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights or is found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, or is unable to maintain the registrations and certifications of its products and facilities, the Company\u2019s business is likely to be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other methods to access markets and create a competitive advantage. Although the Company believes that existing measures are reasonably adequate to protect intellectual property rights, there is no assurance that the measures taken will prevent misappropriation of proprietary information or dissuade others from independent development of similar products or services. Moreover, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to prevent competitors from copying, reverse engineering, modifying or otherwise obtaining and/or using the Company\u2019s technology and proprietary rights to create competitive products or services. The Company may not be able to enforce intellectual property rights outside of the U.S. Additionally, the laws of certain countries in which the Company\u2019s products and services are manufactured or marketed may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Furthermore, other third parties may infringe, challenge, invalidate or circumvent the Company\u2019s patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. In each case, the Company\u2019s ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s products and services are without patent protection. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee validity or enforceability. The Company\u2019s patents may not necessarily be valid or enforceable against third parties. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee that the Company has the right to use the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent the Company from marketing the Company\u2019s own patented products and services and utilizing the Company\u2019s patented technology.\nThe Company is exposed and, in the future, may be exposed to allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement from others. The Company may allege infringement of its patents and other intellectual property rights against others. Under either scenario, the Company could become involved in costly litigation or other legal proceedings regarding its patent or other intellectual property rights, from both an enforcement and defensive standpoint. Even if the Company chooses to enforce its patent or other intellectual property rights against a third party, there may be risk that the Company\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights become invalidated or otherwise unenforceable through legal proceedings. If intellectual property infringement claims are asserted against the Company, the Company could defend itself from such assertions or could seek to obtain a license under the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in order to mitigate exposure. In the event the Company cannot obtain a license, third parties could file lawsuits or other legal proceedings against the Company, seeking damages (including treble damages) or an injunction against the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of the Company\u2019s products and services. These could result in the Company having to discontinue the use, manufacture and sale of certain products and services, increase the cost of selling certain products and services, or result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. An award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction order against the use, manufacture and sale of any of the Company\u2019s products and services found to be infringing, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products and facilities, especially those related to the sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant business, have been registered with the EPA and/or FDA. The failure of the Company to maintain such EPA and FDA registrations could result in the inability of the Company to market or sell its products. In the event that the Company cannot maintain its registrations or licenses or is unable to procure new licenses or registrations for new products or in response to changes to regulatory requirements, the ability of the Company to sell its products and obtain revenue may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of key customers could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could result in a decline in the Company\u2019s revenue.\nIn the CT segment, in the aggregate, revenue derived from the Company\u2019s three largest customers as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled 50% and 40%, respectively. Customer relationships are historically governed by purchase orders or other short-term contractual obligations as opposed to long-term contracts. Losses of customers also may occur due to product, service or pricing issues, as well as industry consolidation. The Company competes in a highly competitive environment and must work diligently to create and maintain productive customer relationships, and the failure to maintain those relationships could result in the loss of one or more key customers. The loss of one or more key customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could result in a decline in the Company\u2019s revenue.\nLoss of key suppliers, the inability to secure raw materials on a timely basis, or the Company\u2019s inability to pass commodity price increases on to its customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers\u2019 needs and could result in a significant loss of customers.\nMaterials used in servicing and manufacturing operations, as well as those purchased for sale, are generally available on the open market from multiple sources. Acquisition costs and transportation of raw materials to the Company\u2019s facilities have historically been impacted by extreme weather conditions. Certain raw materials used by the Company\u2019s CT segment are available only from limited sources; accordingly, any disruptions to critical suppliers\u2019 operations could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations. Prices paid for raw materials could be affected by energy products and other commodity prices; weather and disease associated with our crop dependent raw materials; tariffs and duties on imported materials; foreign currency exchange rates; and phases of the general business cycle and global demand. The Company\u2019s CT segment secures short- and long-term supply agreements for most of its critical raw materials from both domestic and international vendors.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products use citrus terpene as a raw material. While the Company believes that its existing supply and contractual arrangements are sufficient for its current usage, a loss of current supply may require the Company to find alternative raw materials or alternative sources of citrus terpene, each of which could have an adverse effect on the cost of the Company to produce its products.\nThe prices of key raw materials are subject to market fluctuations, which at times can be significant and unpredictable. Availability of key raw materials, weather events, natural disasters, and health epidemics in countries from which the Company sources raw materials may significantly impact prices. The Company may be unable to pass along price increases to its customers, which could result in a materially adverse impact on margins and operating profits. The Company currently uses purchasing strategies designed, where possible, to align the timing of customer demand with the Company\u2019s supply commitments. However, the Company currently does not hedge commodity prices, but may consider such strategies in the future, and there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s purchasing strategies will prevent cost increases from resulting in materially adverse impacts on margins and operating profits.\nThe Company\u2019s DA segment is dependent on its ability to source appropriate technical components for its Verax measurement system, certain of which are specialty products that are sole-sourced and are not easily replaceable with other sources. Any inability to source appropriate components in the future could result in significant difficulty supplying equipment or services to the Company\u2019s customers.\nRemoval of members of management or directors may be difficult or costly.\nThe Company\u2019s management, employees and directors may have retention, employment or severance agreements in place. In the event that our employees, management or directors do not have the proper skills for management or operation of the Company, or the Company otherwise wishes to remove them from their position(s), the Company may be required to pay severance or similar payments. Removal of some management and employees by the Company may also be difficult and require negotiations by the Company.\nFailure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or effectively prevent fraud, the Company\u2019s reputation and operating results could be harmed. If the Company is unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to provide reliable financial reports, which in turn could affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, limit the ability of the Company to access capital markets in the future, and require additional costs to improve internal control systems and procedures. The Company disclosed material weaknesses in internal controls during 2020. The failure to properly remediate each of the material weaknesses, or the discovery of additional material weaknesses, could affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cause the Company to be unable to meet its reporting obligations.\nNetwork disruptions, security threats and activity related to global cyber-crime pose risks to the Company\u2019s key operational, reporting and communication systems.\nThe Company relies on access to information systems for its operations. Failures of, or interference with, access to these systems, such as network communications disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations and could directly impact consolidated reporting. Phishing attacks could result in sensitive or confidential information being released by the Company. Security breaches pose a risk to confidential data and intellectual property, which could result in damages to our competitiveness and reputation. The Company\u2019s policies and procedures, system monitoring and data back-up processes may not prevent or mitigate the effects of these potential disruptions or breaches. There can be no assurance that existing or emerging threats will not have an adverse impact on our systems or communications networks. While the Company does carry cybersecurity insurance, the coverage and amount of such insurance may not be sufficient to adequately compensate the Company for cybersecurity loss.\nThe Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic divestitures, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s past and potential future acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures involve risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Negotiations of potential acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic relationships, integration of newly acquired businesses, and/or sales of existing businesses could be time consuming and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Acquisitions and joint ventures could also expose the Company to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with new markets or businesses. Unforeseen operational difficulties related to acquisitions and joint ventures could result in diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources. Additionally, acquisitions could result in the commitment of capital resources without the realization of anticipated returns. Divestitures could result in the loss of future earnings without adequate compensation and the loss of unrealized strategic opportunities.\nIf the Company does not manage the potential difficulties associated with expansion successfully, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company believes future success will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to adapt to market opportunities and changes, to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses acquired, expansion of existing product and service lines, and potentially expand into new product and service areas in which the Company may not have prior experience. Factors that could result in strategic business difficulties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022failure to effectively integrate acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances;\n\u2022failure to effectively plan for risks associated with expansion into areas in which management lacks prior experience;\n\u2022lack of experienced management personnel;\n\u2022increased administrative burdens;\n\u2022lack of customer retention;\n\u2022technological obsolescence; and\n\u2022infrastructure, technological, communication and logistical problems associated with large, expansive operations.\nIf the Company fails to manage potential difficulties successfully, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to grow and compete could be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available.\nThe ability of the Company to grow and be competitive in the marketplace is dependent on the availability of adequate capital. Access to capital is dependent, in large part, on the Company\u2019s cash flows and the availability of and access to equity and debt financing. The Company cannot guarantee that internally generated cash flows will be sufficient, or that the Company will to be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, the Company may not be able to finance strategic growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or to respond to competitive pressures. The Company\u2019s existing shelf registration statement does not have extra capacity for equity offerings, and there is no guarantee that the Company will file a new shelf registration statement. The Company\u2019s ability to procure debt financing, is dependent on, among other things, the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to lend into the Company\u2019s industry and on their evaluation of the Company\u2019s credit risk. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to procure debt financing or, in the event that it is able to procure debt financing, that the financing will be on favorable terms and conditions or at favorable rates of interest.\nFailure to adapt to changing buying habits at the Company\u2019s potential and existing customers could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain business.\nThe demographics and habits of the purchasing departments of many of the Company\u2019s customers and potential customers is changing. Key decision makers are less experienced and show different buying habits and approaches. Customers are increasingly using advanced analytics to make purchasing decisions. If the Company does not adapt to these changing purchasing trends, the Company may not be able to attract or retain business.\nFailure to collect for goods and services sold to key customers could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe Company performs credit analyses on potential customers; however, credit analysis does not provide full assurance that customers will be willing and/or able to pay for goods and services purchased from the Company. Furthermore, collectability of international sales can be subject to the laws of foreign countries, which may provide more limited protection to the Company in the event of a dispute over payment. Because sales to domestic and international customers are generally made on an unsecured basis, there can be no assurance of collectability. If one or more major customers are unwilling or unable to pay its debts to the Company, it could have an adverse effect of the Company\u2019s financial results, liquidity and cash flows.\nUnforeseen contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company is, and from time to time may become, a party to legal proceedings incidental to the Company\u2019s business involving alleged injuries arising from the use of Company products, exposure to hazardous substances, patent infringement, employment matters, commercial disputes, claims related to adverse physical reactions to the Company\u2019s products such as rashes or allergic reactions and shareholder lawsuits. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses, divert management\u2019s attention, and may require the Company to pay damages that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that the Company may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect against potential loss exposures.\nThe Company\u2019s current insurance policies may not adequately protect the Company\u2019s business from all potential risks.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to risks inherent in the specialty chemical industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, explosions, fires, severe weather, oil and chemical spills, and other hazards. These conditions can result in personal injury or loss of life, damage to property, equipment and the environment, as well as suspension of customers\u2019 oil and gas operations.\nThese events could result in damages requiring costly repairs, the interruption of Company business, including the loss of revenue and profits, and/or the Company being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. The Company does not have insurance against all foreseeable risks. Consequently, losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory pressures, environmental activism, and legislation could result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations restricting volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) exist in many states and/or communities which limit demand for certain products. Although citrus oil is considered a VOC, its health, safety, and environmental profile is preferred over other solvents (e.g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), which is currently creating new market opportunities around the world. Changes in the perception of citrus oils as a preferred VOC, increased consumer activism against hydraulic fracturing or other regulatory or legislative actions by governments could potentially result in materially reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to complex foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, which expose the Company to liabilities that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to, among other things, the protection of natural resources, injury, health and safety considerations, chemical exposure assessment, waste management, and transportation of waste and other hazardous materials. The Company\u2019s operations expose the Company to risks of environmental liability that could result in fines, penalties, remediation, property damage, and personal injury liability. In order to remain compliant with laws and regulations, the Company maintains permits, authorizations, registrations, and certificates as required from regulatory authorities. Sanctions for noncompliance with such laws and regulations could include assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits, and issuance of corrective action orders.\nThe Company could incur substantial costs to ensure compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Laws protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and are expected to continue to evolve and become more complex and restrictive into the future. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in material expense associated with future environmental compliance and remediation. The Company\u2019s costs of compliance could also increase if existing laws and regulations are amended or reinterpreted. Such amendments or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for, and production of, oil and natural gas which, in turn, could limit demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Some environmental laws and regulations could also impose joint and strict liability, meaning that the Company could be exposed in certain situations to increased liabilities as a result of the Company\u2019s conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Remediation expense and other damages arising as a result of such laws and regulations could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in law and regulation relating to hydraulic fracturing may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s revenue in its CT segment is derived from customers engaged in hydraulic fracturing services, a process that creates fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable natural gas or oil to flow more easily through the rock pores to a production well. Some states have adopted regulations which require operators to publicly disclose certain non-proprietary information. These regulations could require the reporting and public disclosure of the Company\u2019s proprietary chemistry formulas. In addition, the Biden administration has proposed additional restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any future federal or state laws or local requirements, or the implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process, could increase the difficulty of oil and natural gas well production activity and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and/or climate change could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nCertain scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d which include carbon dioxide, methane, and other volatile organic compounds, may be contributory to the warming effect of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing worldwide attention.\nExisting or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change, and indoor air quality, including energy conservation or alternative energy incentives, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations, if regulations resulted in a reduction in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas. Other results could be increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions, each of which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company and the Company\u2019s customers are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including political risk, foreign exchange risk, and other uncertainties.\nThe Company and its customers are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to:\n\u2022governmental instability;\n\u2022corruption;\n\u2022war and other international conflicts;\n\u2022civil and labor disturbances;\n\u2022requirements of local ownership;\n\u2022cartel behavior;\n\u2022partial or total expropriation or nationalization;\n\u2022currency devaluation; and\n\u2022foreign laws and policies, each of which can limit the movement of assets or funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or appropriation of property without fair compensation.\nCollections from international customers and agents could also prove difficult due to inherent uncertainties in foreign law and judicial procedures. The Company could experience significant difficulty with collections or recovery due to the political or judicial climate in foreign countries where Company operations occur or in which the Company\u2019s products are used.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations must be compliant with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. laws. The Company could become liable under these laws for actions taken by employees or agents. Compliance with international laws and regulations could become more complex and expensive thereby creating increased risk as the Company\u2019s international business portfolio grows. Further, the U.S. periodically enacts laws and imposes regulations prohibiting or restricting trade with certain nations. The U.S. government could also change these laws or enact new laws that could restrict or prohibit the Company from doing business in identified foreign countries. The Company conducts, and will continue to conduct, business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Historically, the Company has not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s profitability could be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company has no control over and can provide no assurances that future laws and regulations will not materially impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct international business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss and tax attribute carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to utilize pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). An ownership change could limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize existing NOLs and tax attribute carryforwards for taxable years including or following an identified \u201cownership change.\u201d Transactions involving the\nCompany\u2019s common stock, even those outside the Company\u2019s control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the CARES Act provided the ability for taxpayers to carryback NOLs arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to each of the five years preceding the year of the loss. In addition, under the 2017 Tax Act, the ability to carry back NOLs to prior taxable years is generally eliminated, and while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, these post-2017 NOLs may only reduce 80% of the Company\u2019s taxable income in a tax year. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs and tax credits to offset future taxable income could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the NOLs and tax attributes and could require the Company to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of that which would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nGeneral economic declines or recessions, limits to credit availability, and industry specific factors could have an adverse effect on energy industry activity resulting in lower demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nWorldwide economic uncertainty can reduce the availability of liquidity and credit markets to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. The shortage of liquidity and credit combined with pressure on worldwide equity markets could continue to impact the worldwide economic climate. Geopolitical unrest around the world may also impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services both domestically and internationally.\nDemand for many of the Company\u2019s products and services is dependent on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is particularly sensitive to levels of activity in the upstream, downstream and midstream sectors, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. One indication of drilling and completion activity and spending is rig count, which the Company monitors to gauge market conditions. In addition, the U.S. Energy Information Administration and other industry data sources report completion activity, which is utilized by the Company. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or drop in rig and/or completion count could depress current levels of exploration, development, and production activity. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas related products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nThe demand for our sanitizer products is dependent on many factors, including human behavior in response to COVID-19 and market participants in the sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant space. A change in general behavior in response to widespread vaccine availability, relaxed attitudes towards sanitization, consumer reception of our products, or entrants into the sanitizer, surface cleaner and disinfectant space, may materially and adversely affect the demand for our products.\nEvents in global credit markets can significantly impact the availability of credit and associated financing costs for many of the Company\u2019s customers. Many of the Company\u2019s upstream customers finance their drilling and completion programs through third-party lenders or public debt offerings. Lack of available credit or increased costs of borrowing could cause customers to reduce spending on drilling programs, thereby reducing demand and potentially resulting in lower prices for the Company\u2019s products and services. Also, the credit and economic environment could significantly impact the financial condition of some customers over a prolonged period, leading to business disruptions and restricted ability to pay for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nA continuing period of depressed oil and natural gas prices could result in further reductions in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products, especially oil and gas markets, have historically been volatile. Such volatility in oil and natural gas prices, or the perception by the Company\u2019s customers of unpredictability in oil and natural gas prices, could adversely affect spending levels. The oil and natural gas markets may be volatile in the future. The demand for the Company\u2019s\nproducts and services is, in large part, driven by general levels of exploration and production spending and drilling activity by its customers. Future declines in oil or gas prices could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew and existing competitors within the Company\u2019s industries could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe industries in which the Company competes are highly competitive. The Company\u2019s principal competitors include numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in the Company\u2019s markets on a local basis, as well as a number of large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than does the Company. Larger competitors may be able to devote greater resources to developing, promoting, and selling products and services. The Company may also face increased competition due to the entry of new competitors including current suppliers that decide to sell their products and services directly to the Company\u2019s customers. As a result of this competition, the Company could experience lower sales or greater operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s margins and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s industry has a high rate of employee turnover. Difficulty attracting or retaining personnel or agents could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company operates in an industry that has historically been highly competitive in securing qualified personnel with the required technical skills and experience. The Company\u2019s services require skilled personnel able to perform physically demanding work. Due to industry volatility, the demanding nature of the work, and the need for industry specific knowledge and technical skills, current employees could choose to pursue employment opportunities outside the Company that offer a more desirable work environment and/or higher compensation than is offered by the Company. As a result of these competitive labor conditions, the Company may not be able to find qualified labor, which could limit the Company\u2019s growth. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining qualified personnel has increased over the past several years due to competitive pressures. In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, the Company may be required to offer increased wages and benefits. If the Company is unable to increase the prices of products and services to compensate for increases in compensation, or is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, operating results could be adversely affected.\nSevere weather could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather conditions. Hurricanes, tropical storms, flash floods, blizzards, cold weather, and other severe weather conditions could result in curtailment of services, damage to equipment and facilities, interruption in transportation of products and materials, and loss of productivity. If the Company\u2019s customers are unable to operate or are required to reduce operations due to severe weather conditions, and as a result curtail purchases of the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflicts involving the U.S. could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent the Company from meeting financial and other obligations. The Company could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors, or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, impair the ability to raise capital, or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize certain business strategies.\nOur DA segment may be materially and negatively affected by government regulations and/or facility disruptions.\nThe demand for our equipment and services offerings in our DA segment could be materially affected by additional regulations on the upstream, midstream, and downstream portions of the oil and gas sectors. Additional regulation on oil and gas production, transportation, or processing of hydrocarbons may result in significantly reduced demand for our offerings, either individually or as a result of a decline in the overall oil and gas markets in the United States and abroad. In addition, our products are subject to export control laws and regulations, and changes to those laws and regulations may negatively impact\nour ability to pursue international opportunities. Disruptions to pipelines and refineries, whether due to regulation, weather, demand, or other factors, may also have a materially adverse effect on our ability to derive revenue from our DA segment. Adjustments to our DA segment\u2019s commercial strategy, with a shift towards subscription revenue and away from equipment sales, and the market\u2019s response to that strategy, may materially and adversely affect revenues in the near term, even if the strategic shift is successful, due to longer payback periods on subscription models.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Securities\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has historically been subject to significant fluctuations. The following factors, among others, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate due to:\n\u2022variations in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of companies in the Company\u2019s industry;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volume;\n\u2022fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022issuances of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022announcements by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors of new business, acquisitions, or joint ventures; and\n\u2022negative statements made by external parties about the Company\u2019s business in public forums.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected the price of common stock of companies within many industries including the oil and natural gas industry. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little to do with the Company\u2019s operational performance, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the Company\u2019s stock price. The Company could be a defendant in a legal case related to a significant loss of value for the shareholders. This could be expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and Company resources, as well as have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows, financial condition or securities.\nIf the Company cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if it is not able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, which require, among other things, that the average closing price of our common stock be above $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, the Company\u2019s common stock may be delisted. If the Company is unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, its common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of its common stock could negatively impact the Company by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of the its common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the Company\u2019s common stock, which could negatively impact its ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of the Company; and limiting the Company\u2019s ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, delisting from the NYSE might negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation and, as a consequence, its business, operating results, cash flows, financial condition or securities.\nAn active market for the Company\u2019s common stock may not continue to exist or may not continue to exist at current trading levels.\nTrading volume for the Company\u2019s common stock historically has been very volatile when compared to companies with larger market capitalization. The Company cannot presume that an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will continue or be sustained. Sales of a significant number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market could lower the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the Company\u2019s business or publish negative reports, the Company\u2019s securities prices and trading volumes could decline and affect the price at which investors could sell securities.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s securities may be affected by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about the Company or its business. The Company does not have any control over these analysts. If analysts do not cover the Company on a regular basis or if one or more analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports about the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the Company\u2019s securities prices or trading volumes to decline. If one or more of such analysts publish negative reports about the Company, the Company\u2019s securities prices would likely decline. These occurrences could affect the price investors could receive from the sale of the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe Company has no plans to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, and, therefore, investors will have to look to stock appreciation for return on investments.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock within the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend, among other things, on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations deemed relevant by the board of directors. Investors must rely on sales of common stock held after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on their investment. The lack of plans for dividends may make the common stock of the Company an unattractive investment for investors who are seeking dividends.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and applicable Delaware law could discourage or prevent others from acquiring the Company, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022permit the Company to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock, in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of the series;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022limit the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022require advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law limits business combinations with owners of more than 15% of the Company\u2019s voting stock without the approval of the board of directors. Aforementioned provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company exclusive of negotiation. The Company\u2019s board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer deemed not beneficial to or synergistic with the Company\u2019s strategic outlook. If an acquirer were discouraged from offering to acquire the Company or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these anti-takeover measures, stockholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nFuture issuance of additional shares of common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect the Company\u2019s common stock price.\nThe Company is currently authorized to issue up to 140,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company may, in the future, issue previously authorized and unissued shares of common stock, which would result in the dilution of current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests. Additional shares are subject to issuance through various equity compensation plans or through the exercise of currently outstanding equity awards. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in order to raise capital or effectuate\nother business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have an adverse effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may issue a substantial amount of securities in connection with future acquisitions, and the sale of those securities could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or other securities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may issue additional securities, or securities that have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to our other securities. We may file future shelf registration statements with the SEC that we may use to sell securities from time to time in connection with acquisitions. To the extent that we are able to grow through acquisitions and are able to pay for such acquisitions with shares of our common stock or other securities, the number of outstanding shares of common stock or other securities that will be eligible for sale in the future is likely to increase substantially. Persons receiving shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell large quantities of their common stock or other securities, which may influence the price of our common stock or other securities. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock or other securities and result in a lower price than would otherwise be obtained.\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSubject to the rules of the NYSE, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and to set the terms of the issuance without seeking approval from holders of common stock. Currently, there are 100,000 preferred shares authorized, with no shares currently outstanding. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank senior to common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums, and may have greater voting rights than holders of common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf the Company loses the services of key members of management, the Company may not be able to manage operations and implement growth strategies.\nThe Company depends on the continued service of the Chief Executive Officer and President, the Chief Financial Officer and other key members of the executive management team, who possess significant expertise and knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and industry. Furthermore, the Chief Executive Officer and President serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members. Any loss or interruption of the services of key members of the Company\u2019s management could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s ability to manage operations effectively and implement strategic business initiatives. During 2020, the Company replaced its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and lead sales executive. The failure of the new executives to effectively provide services to the Company and build experience and knowledge of the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and ability to compete.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are subject to audit by tax authorities. Taxing authorities may make claims for back taxes, interest and penalties. Changes in U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to income, property, excise, employment, and other taxes in the U.S. and a variety of other jurisdictions around the world. Tax rules and regulations in the U.S. and around the world are complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, taxing authorities conduct audits of the Company\u2019s tax filings and may make claims for increased taxes and, in some cases, assess interest and penalties. The assessments for back taxes, interest, and penalties could be significant. If the Company is unsuccessful in contesting these claims, the resulting payments could result in a drain on the Company\u2019s capital resources and liquidity. In addition, there may be material adverse effects resulting from new or future U.S. tax reforms that have not been identified and that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDisclaimer of Obligation to Update\nExcept as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company assumes no obligation (and specifically disclaims any such obligation) to update these risk factors or any other forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 90783, "SIC": 2891, "TIC": "FTK"}
