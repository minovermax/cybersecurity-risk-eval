RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe are dependent on the success of our lead drug candidates, which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nRXI-109, our lead drug candidate and first RNAi-based product candidate, is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor (\u201cCTGF\u201d), a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis. Samcyprone\u2122, our second drug candidate, is a proprietary topical formulation of the small molecule diphenylcyclopropenone (\u201cDPCP\u201d), an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response. We began the clinical program to reduce the formation of hypertrophic scars with RXI-109 in June 2012, and are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for RXI-109 in this indication and a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in retinal scarring. We initiated our Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of cutaneous warts with Samcyprone\u2122 in December 2015. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) may require additional information from the Company regarding our current or planned trials at any time, and such information may be costly to provide or cause potentially significant delays in development. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop RXI-109, Samcyprone\u2122 or any other product candidate.\nWe have no commercial products and currently generate no revenue from commercial sales or collaborations and may never be able to develop marketable products. The FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies must approve our non-cosmetic products in development before they can be marketed. The process for obtaining FDA approval is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and successful clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. For example, although the results of our Phase 1 clinical trials and preliminary results of our Phase 2 clinical trials of RXI-109 are promising, additional clinical trials will be required to establish the safety and efficacy of RXI-109. While DPCP has been used by physicians for decades, we have not yet shown safety or efficacy in humans for Samcyprone\u2122 or for any of our other product candidates. A failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these products may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. Preliminary observations made in early stages of clinical trials with small numbers of subjects are inherently uncertain. Investors are cautioned that initial clinical trial results are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained when full data sets are analyzed or in subsequent clinical trials.\nA number of different factors could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, or an Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time for various reasons, including if we or they believe the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a drug candidate on subjects in a clinical trial could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspending or terminating the trial and refusing to approve a particular drug candidate for any or all indications of use.\nClinical trials of a new drug candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of subjects, including subjects who are suffering from the disease or condition the drug candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of subject enrollment are affected by many factors, and delays in subject enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times.\nClinical trials also require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our drug development efforts, including the following:\n\u2022\nDelays in filing or acceptance of initial drug applications for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in securing centers to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022\nConditions imposed on us by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nProblems in engaging IRBs to oversee trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB approval of studies;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in enrolling subjects in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u2022\nThird-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nOur drug candidates having unexpected and different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than in laboratory testing and interacting with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways;\n\u2022\nThe need to suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nInsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our drug candidates or other necessary materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nEffects of our drug candidates not being the desired effects or including undesirable side effects or the drug candidates having other unexpected characteristics;\n\u2022\nThe cost of our clinical trials being greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nNegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for similar drug candidates or inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u2022\nChanges in the FDA\u2019s requirements for testing during the course of that testing;\n\u2022\nReallocation of our limited financial and other resources to other clinical programs; and\n\u2022\nAdverse results obtained by other companies developing similar drugs.\nIt is possible that none of the product candidates that we may attempt to develop will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary to begin selling them or that any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable, but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate.\nWe also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside of the United States.\nThe approach we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using RNAi is unproven and may never lead to marketable products.\nRNA interference is a relatively new scientific discovery. Our RNAi technologies have been subject to only limited clinical testing. To date, no company has received regulatory approval to market therapeutics utilizing RNAi, and a number of clinical trials of RNAi technologies by other companies have been unsuccessful. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. To successfully develop RNAi-based products, we must resolve a number of issues, including stabilizing the RNAi material and delivering it into target cells in the human body. We may spend large amounts of money trying to resolve these issues and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, any compounds that we develop may not demonstrate in subjects the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or even harmful ways.\nSamcyprone\u2122 represents a novel approach, topical immunotherapy, to the treatment of skin disorders that presents development challenges to us and may never lead to marketable products.\nAlthough DPCP, the active ingredient in Samcyprone\u2122, has been used by physicians for several decades to stimulate regrowth of hair in patients with alopecia areata and to clear common warts, it has never been reviewed or approved by a regulatory authority as a drug. Other immunomodulatory compounds, such as Imiquimod and Picato\u00ae, have been approved for topical use in other indications by the FDA. Our formulation of DPCP, Samcyprone\u2122, has been subject to only limited clinical testing. Further testing may show that Samcyprone\u2122 may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen or ineffective ways. In addition, to successfully develop Samcyprone\u2122 we must resolve a number of development challenges, including developing a consistent process for the safe administration of the product and establishing a consistent manufacturing process in line with the good manufacturing practice regulations. We may spend significant amounts of money to resolve these development challenges and to obtain regulatory approval for Samcyprone\u2122 and may never succeed in doing so.\nWe have limited experience as a company in the cell-based cancer immunotherapy field.\nPrior to the Company\u2019s acquisition of MirImmune Inc. (\u201cMirImmune\u201d) in January 2017, the Company\u2019s efforts were focused on the development of therapeutics in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology. While we are currently conducting multiple research studies using our sd-rxRNA technology for use in developing ex vivo cell-based cancer immunotherapies, we have limited experience as a company in developing immunotherapy technologies. Because of the number of companies and intense competition in immunotherapy, we may not have the ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties that companies face in this field. In part because of this lack of experience, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies.\nThe use of our RNAi compounds in cell-based cancer immunotherapy is a new approach to the treatment of cancer which may present us with development challenges.\nOur approach to immunotherapy builds on well-established methodologies of adoptive cell transfer. Immune cells, such as T-lymphocytes, are isolated from specific patients or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks and then expanded and sometimes processed to express tumor-binding receptors. To successfully develop drugs based on our approach, we must overcome a number of challenges such as developing a consistent process for the safe administration of enhanced cells to be returned to the patient, developing a manufacturing process in line with good manufacturing practices and demonstrating that our therapies achieve an adequate response compared to their risks. While there have been a number of immunotherapy drugs approved by the FDA, there have been no FDA drug approvals using the approach that we are taking. We will be subjected to thorough regulatory review by the FDA and there is limited experience in this area with a few precedents. We may spend large amounts of money trying to resolve these issues and may never succeed in doing so.\nThe FDA could impose a unique regulatory regime for our therapeutics.\nThe compounds we intend to develop may represent a new class of drug, and the FDA has not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. While we expect any product candidates that we develop will be regulated as a new drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to regulate them or other products we may develop as biologics under the Public Health Service Act. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by defining requirements that we may not have anticipated.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted commercially, which may prevent us from becoming profitable.\nThe product candidates that we are developing are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches. For example, RNAi products may be more expensive to manufacture than traditional small molecule drugs, which may make them costlier than competing small molecule drugs. Additionally, RNAi products do not readily cross the so-called blood brain barrier, are rapidly eliminated from circulating blood and, for various applications, are likely to require injection or implantation, which will make them less convenient to administer than drugs administered orally. Key participants in the pharmaceutical marketplace, such as physicians, medical professionals working in large reference laboratories, public health laboratories and hospitals, third-party payors and consumers may not accept products intended to improve therapeutic results based on our technologies. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use our products or to provide favorable reimbursement. If medical professionals working with large reference laboratories, public health laboratories and hospitals choose not to adopt and use our technologies, our products may not achieve broader market acceptance.\nAdditionally, although we expect that we will have intellectual property protection for our technology, certain governments may elect to deny patent protection for drugs targeting diseases with high unmet medical need (e.g., as in the case of HIV) and allow in their country internationally unauthorized generic competition. If this were to happen, our commercial prospects for developing any such drugs would be substantially diminished in these countries.\nWe are subject to significant competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe believe that numerous companies are investigating or plan to investigate a variety of proposed anti-scarring therapies or cell-based cancer immunotherapies in clinical trials or are working in the RNAi area generally. Many other companies are pursuing non-RNAi-based therapies for one or more fibrotic disease indications, including ocular scarring or other indications that we may seek to pursue. The companies include large and small pharmaceuticals, chemical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities, government agencies and other private and public research organizations.\nWe do not believe that there are any companies developing treatments for cutaneous warts that would be considered direct competitors with the Company, however, there are several existing treatments with which Samcyprone\u2122 could potentially compete.\nMost of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have, and we may not be able to successfully compete with them. In addition, even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, in order to compete successfully we may need to be first to market or to demonstrate that our products are superior to therapies based on different technologies. A number of our competitors have already commenced clinical testing of product candidates and may be more advanced than we are in the process of developing products. If we are not first to market or are unable to demonstrate superiority, any products for which we are able to obtain approval may not be successful.\nWe are dependent on technologies we license, and if we lose the right to license such technologies or fail to license new technologies in the future, our ability to develop new products would be harmed.\nMany patents in the fields we are pursuing have already been exclusively licensed to third parties, including our competitors. If any of our existing licenses are terminated, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses could be delayed or terminated and we may not be able to negotiate additional licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights licensed from other parties; our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent third parties from using our technologies or developing competing products; and we may need to license additional intellectual property from others.\nTherapeutic applications of gene silencing technologies, formulations, delivery methods and other technologies that we license from third parties are claimed in a number of pending patent applications, but there is no assurance that these applications will result in any issued patents or that those patents would withstand possible legal challenges or protect our technologies from competition. The United States Patent and Trademark Office and patent granting authorities in other countries have upheld stringent standards for the RNAi patents that have been prosecuted so far. Consequently, pending patents that we have licensed and those that we own may continue to experience long and difficult prosecution challenges and may ultimately issue with much narrower claims than those in the pending applications. Third parties may hold or seek to obtain additional patents that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to develop products based on our technologies without obtaining a license to such patents, which licenses may not be available on attractive terms, or at all.\nIn addition, others may challenge the patents or patent applications that we currently license or may license in the future or that we own and, as a result, these patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which would negatively affect our ability to exclude others from using the technologies described in these patents. There is no assurance that these patent or other pending applications or issued patents we license or that we own will withstand possible legal challenges. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any patents issued to us or our licensors may not provide us with any competitive advantages, and there is no assurance that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. Our efforts to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights may not be successful and may result in substantial costs and diversion of management time. Even if our rights are valid, enforceable and broad in scope, competitors may develop products based on technology that is not covered by our licenses or patents or patent applications that we own.\nThere is no guarantee that future licenses will be available from third parties for our product candidates on timely or satisfactory terms, or at all. To the extent that we are required and are able to obtain multiple licenses from third parties to develop or commercialize a product candidate, the aggregate licensing fees and milestones and royalty payments made to these parties may materially reduce our economic returns or even cause us to abandon development or commercialization of a product candidate.\nOur success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies.\nThe applications based on RNAi technologies claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, delivery and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Because this field is so new, very few of these patent applications have been fully processed by government patent offices around the world, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about which patents will issue, when, to whom and with what claims. Although we are not aware of any blocking patents or other proprietary rights, it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference and opposition proceedings in various patent offices, relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. It is possible that we may become a party to such proceedings.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing and may not be able to develop our product candidates.\nWe believe that our existing cash will likely be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next 12 months. However, in the future, we may need to incur debt or issue equity in order to fund our planned expenditures as well as to make acquisitions and other investments. We cannot assure you that debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot, or are limited in the ability to, incur debt, issue equity or enter into strategic collaborations, we may be unable to fund the discovery and development of our product candidates, address gaps in our product offerings or improve our technology.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise substantial amounts of money to fund a variety of future activities integral to the development of our business, which may include but is not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nTo conduct research and development to successfully develop our technologies;\n\u2022\nTo obtain regulatory approval for our products;\n\u2022\nTo file and prosecute patent applications and to defend and assess patents to protect our technologies;\n\u2022\nTo retain qualified employees, particularly in light of intense competition for qualified scientists;\n\u2022\nTo manufacture products ourselves or through third parties;\n\u2022\nTo market our products, either through building our own sales and distribution capabilities or relying on third parties; and\n\u2022\nTo acquire new technologies, licenses or products.\nIf we cannot obtain additional financing in the future, our operations may be restricted and we may ultimately be unable to continue to develop and potentially commercialize our product candidates.\nFuture financing may be obtained through, and future development efforts may be paid for by, the issuance of debt or equity, which may have an adverse effect on our stockholders or may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation. In such event, there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled, there may be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of common stock. In addition, if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, whether through private placements or public offerings, such an issuance would dilute your ownership in us.\nThe terms of debt securities may also impose restrictions on our operations, which may include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock, or to make certain acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios, and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult for us to attain profitability, and may lead to uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe expend substantial funds to develop our technologies, and additional substantial funds will be required for further research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials of any product candidates, and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale. Because the successful development of our products is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate enough revenue, even if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable.\nIf we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to secure additional financing, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due, raising substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our common stockholders losing their entire investment. There is no guarantee that we will become profitable or secure additional financing. Our financial statements contemplate that we will continue as a going concern and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern. Changes in our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our expansion plans, increased expenses, potential acquisitions or other events will all affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will rely upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical and cosmetic product candidates.\nWe do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture supplies of any of our potential product candidates for clinical trials or for consumer testing. Accordingly, we depend on a limited number of manufacturers to obtain supplies and we will need to either develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturers for these supplies. If for any reason we are unable to obtain the supplies for our potential product candidates, we would have to seek to obtain it from another major manufacturer. There is no assurance that we will be able to timely secure needed supply arrangements on satisfactory terms, or at all. Our failure to secure these arrangements as needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates or, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, to commercialize them.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop or potentially commercialize some or all of our product candidates.\nWe expect to depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to manufacture our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for or maintain relationships with collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, vendors and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to successfully negotiate such agreements will depend on, among other things, potential partners\u2019 evaluation of the superiority of our technology over competing technologies, the quality of the preclinical and clinical data that we have generated and the perceived risks specific to developing our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates. We cannot necessarily control the amount or timing of resources that our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion. We may not be able to readily terminate any such agreements with contract partners even if such contract partners do not fulfill their obligations to us.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities from clinical testing and future product liability claims.\nIf any of our future products are alleged to be defective, they may expose us to claims for personal injury by subjects in clinical trials of our products. If our non-cosmetic products are approved by the FDA, users may claim that such products caused unintended adverse effects. We will seek to obtain clinical trial insurance for clinical trials that we conduct, as well as liability insurance for any products that we market. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in the amounts we seek, or at all. We anticipate that licensees who develop our products will carry liability insurance covering the clinical testing and marketing of those products. There is no assurance, however, that any insurance maintained by us or our licensees will prove adequate in the event of a claim against us. Even if claims asserted against us are unsuccessful, they may divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and we may have to incur substantial costs to defend such claims.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf approved, we intend to sell our products to physicians, plastic surgeons and dermatologists, as well as hospitals, oncologists and clinics that receive reimbursement for the healthcare services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Most third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, was used for an unapproved indication or if they believe the cost of the product outweighs its benefits. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, because our programs are still in development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost-effectiveness and the level or method of reimbursement for them. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe currently expect that any drugs we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician. Under currently applicable law, drugs that are not usually self-administered may be eligible for coverage by the Medicare program if:\n\u2022\nThey are \u201cincidental\u201d to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u2022\nThey are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standard of medical practice;\n\u2022\nThey are not excluded as immunizations; and\n\u2022\nThey have been approved by the FDA.\nInsurers may refuse to provide insurance coverage for newly approved drugs, including drugs in our clinical pipeline, or insurance coverage may be delayed or be more limited than the purpose for which the drugs are approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for insurance coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to develop products and our overall financial condition.\nAdditionally, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products. If our customers are not reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComprehensive healthcare reform legislation, which became law in 2010, and any revisions to this legislation, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Among other provisions, the legislation provides that a \u201cbiosimilar\u201d product may be approved by the FDA on the basis of analytical tests and certain clinical studies demonstrating that such product is highly similar to an existing, approved product and that switching between an existing product and the biosimilar product will not result in diminished safety or efficacy. This abbreviated regulatory approval process may result in increased competition if we are able to bring a product to market. The legislation also includes more stringent compliance programs for companies in various sectors of the life sciences industry with which we may need to comply and enhanced penalties for non-compliance with the new healthcare regulations. Complying with new regulations may divert management resources, and inadvertent failure to comply with new regulations may result in penalties being imposed on us.\nSome states and localities have established drug importation programs for their citizens, and federal drug import legislation has been introduced in Congress. The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan legislation, which became law in 2003, required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations for drug reimportation from Canada into the United States under some circumstances, including when the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States. The Secretary, however, retained the discretion not to implement a drug reimportation plan if the Secretary finds that the benefits do not outweigh the costs, and has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nWith the new U.S. administration and Congress, there may be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market drugs and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will remain subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that are reported after our drug products are\nmade available to patients. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or vigilance required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug products will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with the product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the drug from the market. We would continue to be subject to the FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information for all of our product candidates, even those that the FDA had approved. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and other adverse consequences.\nIf we fail to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to design, develop, market or sell our products or successfully manage our business.\nOur business prospects are dependent on our management team and all of our employees. The loss of any of our key employees, including Drs. Cauwenbergh, Pavco and Eliseev, who serve as our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Development Officer and our Chief Business Officer, respectively, or our inability to identify, attract, retain and integrate additional qualified key personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business successfully and achieve our business objectives.\nCompetition for skilled research, product development, regulatory and technical personnel is intense, and we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need. The loss of the services of any key research, product development, regulatory and technical personnel, or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills, could restrict our ability to develop our product candidates.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock markets, in general, and the markets for drug delivery and pharmaceutical company stocks, in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could be extremely expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and the Company\u2019s resources.\nWe may not be able to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn February 2, 2017, we received written notice (the \u201cNotification Letter\u201d) from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notification Letter, we no longer meet the minimum bid price requirement.\nThe Notification Letter does not impact our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. The Notification Letter states that we have 180 calendar days, or until August 1, 2017, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the bid price of our common stock must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time prior to August 1, 2017. In the event that we do not regain compliance by August 1, 2017, we may be eligible for additional time to reach compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, if we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price listing requirement or fail to maintain compliance with all other applicable continued listing requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; limiting our ability to issue additional securities in the future; and limiting our ability to fund our operations.\nWe have issued preferred stock in the past and possibly may issue more preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. There were no shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 1,082,114 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at March 15, 2017, respectively. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. The issuance of our preferred stock could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding preferred stock or common stock. In particular, rights granted to holders of certain series of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could dilute your ownership interest in the Company.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other complementary businesses and technology licensing arrangements. We also may pursue strategic alliances. We have limited experience with respect to acquiring other companies and with respect to the formation of collaborations, strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to integrate such acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. We also could experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition related charges, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles and impairment charges relating to write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets from time to time following the acquisition. Integration of an acquired company requires management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license or strategic alliance. For example, in January 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of MirImmune. The assets and development programs acquired from MirImmune are at an early stage of development and will require a significant investment of time and capital if we are to be successful in developing them. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing such assets, and a failure to successfully develop such assets could diminish our prospects.\nTo finance future acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock as consideration, which would dilute your ownership interest in us. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders. Any future acquisitions by us also could result in large and immediate write-offs, the incurrence of contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to acquired intangible assets, any of which could harm our operating results.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings in the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nProvide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 14468, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PHIO"}
