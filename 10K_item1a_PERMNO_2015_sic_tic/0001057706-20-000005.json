{"cik": "1057706", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /PR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere follows a discussion about significant risks and uncertainties that could impact the Corporation\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including by causing the Corporation\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to the Corporation or its management and those that the Corporation or its management currently deems to be immaterial, could also affect the Corporation in a materially adverse way in future periods. Thus, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties the Corporation may face. See the discussion under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION\u2019S BUSINESS\nOur pending acquisition of BSPR exposes us to increased regulatory, business, reputational, and other risks that may adversely affect our business and our future results of operations.\nOur pending acquisition of BSPR in an all cash stock purchase, which was announced on October 21, 2019, subjects us to increased risks, including the following:\n\uf0b7our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition on terms acceptable to us;\n\uf0b7the risk that, during the time period when regulatory approval is being sought, customers of BSPR may establish relationships with different financial institutions or that prospective customers may delay engaging our services or seek alternative financial services;\n\uf0b7significant costs, expenses, and resources associated with the acquisition and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention that could otherwise have been devoted to our existing operations or to alternative transactions;\n\uf0b7the risk that, if the acquisition is completed, the businesses will not be integrated successfully;\n\uf0b7the risk that the cost savings and any other synergies from the acquisition may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and\n\uf0b7potential disruption from the acquisition making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of the BSPR acquisition depends upon obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. There can be no assurance as to when or whether these regulatory approvals will be received, or the conditions associated with any approval.\nThe financial services industry in the markets in which we operate is highly competitive. During the time period when regulatory approval is being sought, customers of BSPR may establish relationships with different banks or other financial institutions for a number of reasons, including any expectation of disruptions in customer service or uncertainty regarding how the acquisition will affect them. If that occurs, we may not obtain the number of customers from the acquisition that we currently anticipate obtaining. Further, potential customers may delay or defer engaging the Corporation\u2019s services or may seek out other banks or financial institutions due to the uncertainty of the acquisition of BSPR.\nIf the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained and the transaction closes, the acquisition will require integration of systems, procedures, and personnel of BSPR into FirstBank. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and may also be disruptive to the customers of BSPR. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, the Corporation may lose customers or employees of BSPR, the Corporation may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of the acquisition within the expected time frame, or at all. The Corporation may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful. In addition, the Corporation will have to integrate BSPR\u2019s internal controls into the Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which may be difficult, may take longer than anticipated or may be ineffective.\nThe pending acquisition of BSPR has resulted in significant financial, legal and other professional service fees and has required substantial time and attention from our management, all of which could have been devoted to our existing operations or other opportunities. In addition, activities surrounding the satisfaction of all conditions to closing and other obligations under the purchase agreement, and the integration process may result in further significant expenses or may further divert our management\u2019s time and attention. Even if the Corporation is successful in its integration of BSPR, delays in the process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Corporation made assumptions and estimates concerning the fair value of assets and liabilities to be acquired in evaluating the potential acquisition and the purchase price. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from the Corporation\u2019s assumptions and estimates, which could result in the Corporation\u2019s inability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nLastly, events outside of our control, including changes in the regulatory environment and laws, as well as economic trends, could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, revenue, expenses, operating results and financial condition.\nOur level of non-performing assets may adversely affect our future results from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we continued to have a high level of nonaccrual loans, even though the level decreased by $121.4 million to $210.7 million as of December 31, 2019, or 37%, from $332.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Our nonaccrual loans represent approximately 2% of our $9.0 billion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we had a high level of total non-performing assets, even though they decreased by $149.7 million to $317.4 million as of December 31, 2019, or 32%, from $467.1 million as of December 31, 2018. If we are unable to effectively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nFirstBank relies primarily on customer deposits, the issuance of brokered CDs, and advances from the FHLB of New York to maintain its lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we had $435.1 million in brokered CDs outstanding, representing approximately 5% of our total deposits, and a reduction of $120.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $231.4 million in brokered CDs mature over the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, and the average term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was approximately 1.3 years. None of these CDs are callable at the Corporation\u2019s option.\nAlthough FirstBank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions change. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nAlternate sources of funding may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from FirstBank have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our TRuPs and other obligations. Our banking subsidiary is limited by law in its ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on its earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking subsidiary to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.\nCredit quality may result in additional losses.\nThe quality of our loans has continued to be under pressure as a result of continued recessionary conditions in the Puerto Rico region that have led to, among other things, high unemployment levels, low absorption rates for new residential construction projects and declines in property values. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments. When the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases or the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, our business, financial condition, allowance levels, asset impairments, liquidity, capital and results of operations are adversely affected.\nWe had a commercial and construction loan portfolio held for investment in the amount of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Furthermore, given the slowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of if they are foreclosed. We may incur losses over the near term, either because of continued deterioration of the quality of loans or because of sales of problem loans, which would likely accelerate the recognition of losses. Any such losses would adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital ratios, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject, among other things, to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and purchase. We recognize periodic credit loss expenses on loans, which leads to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans at a level that our management deems to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan and lease portfolios. Management may fail to accurately estimate the level of loan and lease losses or may have to increase our credit loss expense on loans in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans, future increases in nonaccrual loans, foreclosure actions and loan modifications, changes in current and expected economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses on loans and may require an increase in the credit loss expense on loans or the recognition of additional classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates based upon various assumptions and judgments as to specific credit risks, its evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio and, since the beginning of 2020, reasonable and supportable forecasts. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses on loans may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our credit loss expense on loans could increase substantially.\nAny such increases in our credit loss expense on loans or any loan losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses on loans would have an adverse effect on our future capital ratios, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in collateral values of properties located in stagnant or distressed economies may require increased reserves.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 1%, 16% and 33% of our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of construction, commercial mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively.\nWhether the collateral that underlies our loans is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI, or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Puerto Rico, where most of the collateral is located, has been in an economic recession since 2006. Sustained weak economic conditions that have affected Puerto Rico over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values.\nConstruction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2019, our commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans held for investment in Puerto Rico amounted to $1.0 billion, or 67% of the total $1.6 billion commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans, which constituted 17% of the total loan portfolio held for investment.\nWe measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter. In addition, appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics, such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal and loan-to-value ratios. The appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans has required and, in the future, may require increases in our credit loss expense on loans. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s force-placed insurance policies could be disputed by the customer.\nThe Corporation maintains force-placed insurance policies that have been put into place when a borrower\u2019s insurance policy on a property was canceled, lapsed or was deemed insufficient and the borrower did not secure a replacement policy. A borrower may make a claim against the Corporation under such force-placed insurance policy and the failure of the Corporation to resolve such a claim to the borrower\u2019s satisfaction may result in a dispute between the borrower and the Corporation, which if not adequately resolved, could have an adverse effect on the Corporation.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income.\nShifts in short-term interest rates have reduced net interest income in the past and, in the future, may reduce net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences in the re-pricing structure of our assets and liabilities may result in changes in our profits when interest rates change.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce demand for mortgage and other loans.\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce future demand for such loans, which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of loan interest income due to declines in volume.\nAccelerated prepayments may adversely affect net interest income.\nIn general, fixed-income portfolio yields would decrease if the re-investment of pre-payment amounts is at lower rates. Net interest income could also be affected by prepayments of MBS. Acceleration in the prepayments of MBS would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon the acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration in the prepayments of MBS would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by our investment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities.\nChanges in interest rates on loans and borrowings may adversely affect net interest income.\nBasis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the difference, also referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or basis, between the rates for two or more different instruments with the same maturity and occurs when market rates for different financial instruments or the indices used to price assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts. For example, the interest expense for liability instruments might not change by the same amount as interest income received from loans or investments. To the extent that the interest rates on loans and borrowings change at different rates and by different amounts, the margin between our variable rate-based assets and the cost of the interest-bearing liabilities might be compressed and adversely affect net interest income.\nIf all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated statement of financial condition is determined to be related to credit factors, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we recognized a total of $12.2 million, $50 thousand and $0.5 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairments. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized or unrecognized losses in our investment securities portfolio of $38.4 million as of December 31, 2019 is determined to be related to credit factors, we would recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and capital ratios could be adversely affected. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with this portfolio is related to credit factors, increases in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment towards us. Any negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital or credit markets or might increase our cost of capital. In addition, beginning on January 1, 2020, new authoritative accounting guidance requires the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses for certain assets measured at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity debt securities. Valuation and credit losses determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates, severity rates and macro-economic factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing funds.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding could be adversely affected by downgrades in our credit ratings. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity is to a certain extent contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation\u2019s current credit ratings and any downgrades in such credit ratings can hinder the Corporation\u2019s access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties relating to the loans sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and relate to, among other things:\n\uf0b7compliance with laws and regulations;\n\uf0b7underwriting standards;\n\uf0b7the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan files; and\n\uf0b7the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and may not be saleable or may be saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but certain employees may make mistakes or may deliberately violate our lending policies.\nWe are subject to certain regulatory restrictions that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.\nUnder federal law, financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a broader range of \u201cfinancial\u201d activities than those permitted to bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. A financial holding company that ceases to meet certain standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances, including the prohibition from undertaking new activities or acquiring shares or control of other companies. If we fail to comply with the requirements from our regulators, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement action and other adverse regulatory actions that might have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted and periodically improve various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. Any improvements to our controls, procedures, policies and systems, however, may not be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage, or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.\nOur operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters. In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nThird parties perform key aspects of our business operations, such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we believe that we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any significant problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, the provision by a vendor of poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years, especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels, and the sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties have increased. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third-party providers, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks, such as computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information.\nWe have a robust and thourough Information Security Program which continuously monitors cyber-related risks and ultimately ensures protection for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, a formal vendor management program is in place to oversee third-party and vendor risks. The Corporation\u2019s system of internal controls also incorporates an organization-wide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, to ensure effective and efficient resolution and, if necessary, disclosure of any matters. The Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors is actively engaged in the oversight of the Corporation\u2019s continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.\nCompetition for our executives and other key employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of uncertainty concerning compensation restrictions applicable to banks but not applicable to other financial services firms. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience and, in some cases, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Similarly, the loss of our executives or other key employees, either individually or as a group, could result in a loss of customer confidence in our ability to execute banking transactions on their behalf.\nOur compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, the regulation of our compensation practices may change in the future.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. As discussed above, the Corporation currently is subject to the 2010 interagency guidance governing the incentive compensation activities of regulated banks and bank holding companies. Our failure to satisfy these restrictions and guidelines could expose us to adverse regulatory criticism, lowered supervisory ratings, and restrictions on our operations and acquisition activities. In addition, the federal banking agencies have proposed new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that place restrictions on the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations with $1 billion or more in assets.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.\nFurther increases in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or in FDIC required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to certain limits (currently, $250,000 per depositor account). The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the DIF. In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and, if necessary, pays all insured deposits up to the statutory deposit insurance limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will require institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, such as FirstBank, to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35 percent (the ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020.\nOn September 30, 2018, the DIF Reserve Ratio reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. According to FDIC regulations upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as FirstBank, ceased during 2019; and (2) small banks received assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent.\nThe FDIC may increase FirstBank\u2019s premiums or impose additional assessments or prepayment requirements in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC free to set this cap going forward.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.\nFrom time to time, our customers, or the government on their behalf, makes claims and takes legal actions relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. We have also faced employment lawsuits and other legal claims. In any such future claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us, resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgements may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which has occurred in the past and may again occur, resulting in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us in the future could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters, when unfavorable, has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationships with many of our customers are predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, or our ability to attract and retain customers or obtain sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses, the market places in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If we fail to promptly address matters that bear on our reputation, our reputation may be materially adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). The FASB has issued financial accounting and reporting standards that will govern key aspects of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where the Corporation is required to make assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB\u2019s new accounting standard on credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d), which became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020, requires earlier recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The new accounting model requires that lifetime \u201cexpected credit losses\u201d of financial assets not recorded at fair value through net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the multiple existing impairment models under GAAP which generally require that a loss be \u201cincurred\u201d before it is recognized. Accordingly, the new accounting model presents operational challenges and requires the Corporation to change how it makes assumptions and estimates on loan and lease losses as well as other financial assets. The Corporation expects that the adoption of this new accounting standard will result in a combined increase of approximately $93 million in our allowance for credit losses for all applicable on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures and a corresponding decrease, net of applicable income taxes, in retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. For additional information on this and other accounting standards, see Note 1, \u201cNature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or regulators, could also present operational challenges and could require the Corporation to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumption and estimates are used in preparing the Corporation\u2019s financial statements, see Note 1, \u201cNature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. We conducted our most recent evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the book value of our goodwill was $28.1 million, which was recorded at the Bank.\nIf an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Banks\u2019 earnings and thereby restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $264.8 million (net of a valuation allowance of $86.6 million, including a valuation allowance of $55.6 million against the deferred tax assets of the Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiary FirstBank). Under Puerto Rico law, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including FirstBank, are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Accordingly, to obtain a tax benefit from NOLs, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income. To obtain the full benefit of the applicable deferred tax asset attributable to NOLs, FirstBank and its pass-through entities must have sufficient taxable income within the applicable carryforward period. Pursuant to the 2011 PR Code, the carryforward period for NOLs incurred during taxable years that commenced after December 31, 2004 and ended before January 1, 2013 is 12 years; for NOLs incurred during taxable years commencing after December 31, 2012, the carryover period is 10 years. Accounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. Due to significant estimates utilized in determining the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, in the future, the Corporation may not be able to reverse the remaining valuation allowance or may need to increase its current deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s judgments regarding tax accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Corporation provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP.\nFluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. In addition, the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (\u201cPRTD\u201d), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions and we may estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under applicable GAAP. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate and could result in a material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nChanges in the Tax Law in multiple jurisdictions can materially affect our operations, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nFirst BanCorp. is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, it is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those regions. The USVI jurisdiction imposes income taxes based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code under the \u201cmirror system\u201d established by the Naval Service Appropriations Act of 1922. However, the USVI jurisdiction also imposes an additional 10% surtax on the USVI tax liability, if any.\nThese tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. In addition, legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOn December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed Act 257 into law to amend some of the provisions of the 2011PR Code. Act 257 introduced various changes to the current income tax regime applicable to individuals and corporations, and the sales and use taxes, which took effect on January 1, 2019, including, among others, (i) a reduction in the Puerto Rico corporate tax rate from 39% to 37.5%; (ii) an increase in the net operating and capital losses usage limitation from 80% to 90%; (iii) amendments to the provisions related to \u201cpass-through\u201d entities that provide that corporations that own 50% or more of a partnership will not be able to claim a current or carryover non partnership NOL deduction against a partnership distributable share; adversely impacting a tax action taken in 2017 for FirstBank Insurance under which the Corporation was previously allowed to offset pass-through income earned by FirstBank Insurance with net operating losses at the holding company level; and (iv) other limitations on certain deductions, such as meals and entertainment deductions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Corporation recorded a one-time charge of $9.9 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets resulting from the aforementioned reduction in the corporate tax rates (net of the $5.6 million related impact in the valuation allowance).\nChanges in applicable tax laws in Puerto Rico, the U.S. or other jurisdictions or tax authorities\u2019 new interpretations could result in increases in our overall taxes and the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be limited.\nThe Corporation has Puerto Rico, U.S. and USVI sourced NOL carryforwards. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) limits the ability to utilize U.S. and USVI NOLs for income tax purposes, respectively, at such jurisdictions following an event of an ownership change. Generally, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage over a three-year testing period. Section 1034.04(u) of the 2011 PR Code is significantly similar to Section 382. However, Act 60-2019 amended the PR Code to repeal the corporate NOL carryover limitations upon change in control for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018.\nUpon the occurrence of a Section 382 ownership change, the use of NOLs attributable to the period prior to the ownership change is subject to limitations and only a portion of the U.S. and USVI NOLs, as applicable, may be used by the Corporation to offset the annual U.S. and USVI taxable income, if any. In 2017, the Corporation completed a formal ownership change analysis within the meaning of Section 382 covering a comprehensive period, and concluded that an ownership change, for U.S. and USVI purposes only, had occurred during such period. The Section 382 limitation has resulted in higher U.S. and USVI income tax liabilities than we would have incurred in the absence of such limitation.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the utilization of our U.S. and USVI NOLs could be further limited due to future changes in our stock ownership, as a result of either sales of our outstanding shares or issuances of new shares that could separately or cumulatively trigger an ownership change and, consequently, a Section 382 limitation. Any further Section 382 limitations may result in greater U.S. and USVI tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such a limitation and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. We may be able to mitigate the adverse effects associated with a Section 382 limitation in the U.S. and USVI to the extent that we could credit any resulting additional U.S. and USVI tax liability against our tax liability in Puerto Rico. However, our ability to reduce our Puerto Rico tax liability through such a credit or deduction will depend on our tax profile at each annual taxable period, which is dependent on various factors.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Furthermore, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive to implement than we anticipate.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the real estate market in Puerto Rico could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. During periods of rising interest rates, the refinancing of many mortgage products tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values.\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the economic slowdown in the U.S. in the late 2000s and early 2010s and in Puerto Rico since 2006. Unemployment, volatile interest rates and declines in housing prices have had a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our ability to sell loans, the prices we receive for loans, the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.\nHurricanes and other natural disaster or health epidemics events could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur operations are located in regions susceptible to hurricanes and vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. In the past, events such as the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 have caused disruptions to our operations and have had adverse effects on our overall results of operations. At the end of December 2019 and in early January 2020, the southwestern part of Puerto Rico was struck by a series of seismic events. The largest and most damaging of these events occurred on January 7, 2020, an earthquake that had a magnitude of 6.4 on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale. This earthquake and related aftershocks damaged several structures, including residences, historical buildings, and high-rise buildings in the affected areas. However, damages to the Corporation\u2019s facilities and OREO properties in the affected areas were minor and we do not believe that such damages would be material to our financial position. While we maintain insurance for natural disasters, including coverage for profits and extra expense, there is no protection against any disruption to the markets that we serve resulting from any such a catastrophe. Further, natural disasters in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us, and the value of properties and facilities of the Corporation, other real estate owned properties, or other assets. Although on extraordinary situations, certain of our clients may also be affected for the outbreak of health epidemics that could disrupt their operations.\nThe severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disaster or health epidemic event are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future natural disaster events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if our borrowers are adversely affected by health epidemics, or a health crisis affects economic growth, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, despite having no direct operations in the epicenter of an epidemic.\nThe Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition, and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic challenges in Puerto Rico.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006. Based on the most recent information available included in the Fiscal Plan submitted by the Puerto Rico government and certified by the PROMESA oversight board on May 9, 2019 (the \u201cNew Fiscal Plan\u201d), the Puerto Rico government projects growths in Puerto Rico\u2019s gross national product (\u201cGNP\u201d) of 4.0% and 1.5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and a contraction of 0.9% for fiscal year 2021.\nThe Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index (the \u201cEDB-EAI\u201d) in November 2019 was 121.8, an increase of 0.3% compared to November 2018, the second year-over-year consecutive positive growth after four year-over-year consecutive declines, and increased by 0.1% when compared to October 2019. The EDB-EAI is a coincident index of economic activity for Puerto Rico made up of four indicators (cement sales, gasoline consumption, electric power generation and non-farm payroll employment). The cement sales for November 2019 totaled 1.2 million 94-pound bags, an increase of 4.0% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 1.6%. Estimated gasoline consumption in November 2019 was 73.7 million gallons, a 6.0% decrease when compared with October 2019, and a decrease of 9.1% compared to the same period in 2018. Electric power generation for November 2019 totaled 1,597.6 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 0.3% over the prior month, and an annual increase of 4.4% compared with the same period in 2018. Total non-farm payroll employment for November 2019 averaged 874,600 employees, an upturn of 0.4% compared to October 2019, and an annual increase of 0.8% compared with the same period in 2018. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 8.4% in December 2019, compared to 7.9% in November 2019. The average of the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico was 44.7% from 1990 until 2019, reaching an all-time high of 49.8% in February 2007 and a record low of 38.5% in October 2017. The New Fiscal Plan projects that inflation rates will reach 1.09%, 1.43%, 1.47%, 1.46% and 1.47% for fiscal years 2020 through 2024, respectively.\nBased on information published by the Puerto Rico Treasury, the net revenues of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s General Fund in November 2019 totaled approximately $531 million, a decrease of approximately $26 million, or 4.65%, when compared with November 2018. The net revenue to the General Fund for the first five months of the fiscal year 2019-20 (July - November) was $4.2 billion, an increase of $680 million or 19.2%, compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year.\nThe New Fiscal Plan approved by the PROMESA oversight board on May 9, 2019 uses a six-year horizon and projects an 8.4% decline in population over the next six years (when compared to Fiscal Year 2018), with the assumption that the low historical rate of immigration into Puerto Rico will continue. In addition, the New Fiscal Plan established an annual emergency reserve of $130 million for 10 years. The New Fiscal Plan also assumes approximately $83 billion in disaster relief funding and projects to create a temporary fiscal surplus through fiscal year 2024. The New Fiscal Plan includes and maintains a series of structural reforms in areas such as: (i) human capital and labor; (ii) ease of doing business; (iii) power sector reform; and (iv) infrastructure reform. The New Fiscal Plan projects that the $83 billion of disaster relief funding from federal and private sources will be disbursed in the reconstruction effort. It will provide funding for individuals (e.g., for the reconstruction of houses, personal expenditures related to the hurricane, such as clothing and supplies) and the public (e.g., for the reconstruction of major infrastructure, roads, and schools), and will be used to cover part of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\u2019s (the \u201cCommonwealth\u201d) share of the cost of disaster relief funding (recipients often must match some portion of federal public assistance spend). Approximately $49 billion of the Commonwealth\u2019s share is estimated to come from the Federal Emergency Management Administration\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund for public assistance, hazard mitigation, mission assignments, and individual assistance. An estimated $8 billion will come from private and business insurance payouts, and $6 billion is related to other federal funding. The New Fiscal Plan includes approximately $20 billion of funding from the Community Development Block Grants Disaster Relief program (\u201cCDBG\u201d), of which approximately $2.4 billion is estimated to be allocated to offset the Commonwealth\u2019s and its entities\u2019 expected cost-share requirements. This portion of CDBG funding will go towards covering part of the approximate 10% cost share burden on expenditures attributable to the Commonwealth, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d), Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, and the Highways and Transportation Authority from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2025, given statutory requirements regarding the timeline of CDBG spending. The New Fiscal Plan also allocates $1.8 billion to the Commonwealth-funded cost share, which includes $100 million per year from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2025 to cover local costs in the event that fewer CDBG funds than anticipated become available.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $204.5 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $214.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $182.5 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, compared to $191.9 million as of December 31, 2018. Approximately 76% of the Corporation\u2019s municipality exposure consisted primarily of senior priority obligations concentrated in three of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. The municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. During the second quarter of 2019, the PROMESA oversight board announced the designation of the Commonwealth\u2019s 78 municipalities as covered instrumentalities under PROMESA. Meanwhile, the latest fiscal plan certified by the PROMESA oversight board did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities but the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls, as well as measures included in fiscal plans of other government entities. In addition to municipalities, the total direct exposure also included a $13.8 million loan to an affiliate of PREPA and obligations of the Puerto Rico government, specifically bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (the \u201cPRHFA\u201d), at an amortized cost of $8.2 million (fair value of $7.3 million as of December 31, 2019) as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $106.9 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the PRHFA, compared to $112.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the PRHFA are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal for all loans under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently-released audited financial statements of the PRHFA, as of June 30, 2016, the PRHFA\u2019s mortgage loans insurance program covered loans in an aggregate of approximately $576 million. The regulations adopted by the PRHFA require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loan insurance fund. As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date as to which information is available, the PRHFA had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $826.9 million of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico, compared to $677.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Approximately 37% is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 63% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies in Puerto Rico.\nFurther deterioration in economic activity, delays in the receipt of disaster relief funds allocated to Puerto Rico, and the potential impact on asset values resulting from past or future natural disaster events, when added to Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position.\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the U.S. Virgin Islands could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe USVI government is experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. Preliminary data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, showed that the USVI real GDP increased 1.5% in 2018 after decreasing 0.6% in 2017. In mid- February 2017, the USVI was facing a financial crisis due to a very high debt level of $2 billion and a structural budget deficit of $110 million. Despite recent improvements in general fund revenues, several challenges remain present, including the need to close the USVI government structural deficit gap, implement measures to address the solvency of the USVI government employee retirement system, and regain access to capital markets at reasonable terms. In addition, the most senior bonds of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority were downgraded by Moody\u2019s to eight steps below investment grade. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities.\nTo the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI government continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of the USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $64.1 million in loans to USVI government instrumentalities and public corporations, compared to $55.8 million as of December 31, 2018. Of the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019, public corporations of the USVI owed approximately $40.8 million and an independent instrumentality of the USVI government owed approximately $23.2 million. As of December 31, 2019, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments. The Corporation cannot predict at this time the ultimate effect that the current fiscal situation of the USVI government will have on the economic activity and the Corporation\u2019s clients. Adverse developments in the economic activity of this region could result in adverse effects on the Corporation\u2019s profitability and credit quality.\nDifficult market conditions have affected the financial industry and may adversely affect us in the future.\nGiven that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the U.S. and given the degree of interrelation between Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and that of the U.S., we are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, including factors such as unemployment and underemployment levels in the U.S. and real estate valuations. The deterioration of these conditions adversely affected us in the past and, in the future, could adversely affect the credit performance of mortgage loans, and result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks:\n\uf0b7Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\uf0b7The models used to estimate losses inherent in the credit exposure, particularly those under the new credit loss accounting model which took effect on January 1, 2020, require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the models.\n\uf0b7Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties (including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government-sponsored entities and repurchase agreements) on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital or credit markets or other events, including deteriorating investor expectations.\n\uf0b7Competitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\n\uf0b7Expected future regulation of our industry may increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\uf0b7There may be downward pressure on our stock price.\nAny future deterioration of economic conditions in the U.S. and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty Regarding the Possible Discontinuation of LIBOR after 2021\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not assured after 2021. Therefore, regulators and market participants in various jurisdictions have been working to recommend alternative rates to LIBOR for each respective currency that are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission\u2019s standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. The Federal Reserve started to publish the SOFR in April 2018. The SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\uf0b7Adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the Corporation\u2019s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, primarily commercial and construction loans, private label MBSs, the Corporation\u2019s junior subordinated debentures, and certain other financial arrangements such as repurchase agreements, money market deposit accounts, and derivatives. As of December 31, 2019, the most significant of the Corporation\u2019s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities consists of $1.7 billion of commercial and construction loans (approximately 44% of the Corporation\u2019s commercial and construction loan portfolio), approximately $82 million of U.S. agencies debt securities and private label MBS held as part of the Corporation\u2019s available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, $107.3 million of Puerto Rico municipalities bonds held as part of the Corporation\u2019s held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio, and $184.2 million of junior subordinated debentures;\n\uf0b7Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Corporation\u2019s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and\n\uf0b7Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts.\nThe transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to, or development of, appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Corporation\u2019s risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as SOFR. The Corporation has developed a LIBOR Transition Working Group (\u201cLTWG\u201d) to define the scope and potential impact that the replacement of LIBOR will have across the Corporation's LIBOR-based assets and liabilities outstanding. The LTWG is composed by officers of the major areas affected, including: Treasury, Legal, Corporate Loans, Credit, Operations, Systems, Asset-Liability Management, Risk, Accounting, Financial Reporting, Public Relations, and Strategic Planning. The LIBOR impacted areas are developing a LIBOR Transition workplan and timetable of their areas; identifying the systems, models, and applications impacted by the transition; and the resources necessary for the transition. There can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.\nThe manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine financing transactions could be adversely affected by future failures of financial institutions and the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies and other institutional clients. In certain of these transactions, we are required to post collateral to secure the obligations to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral, or we may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty or under other circumstances.\nIn addition, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. The credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any losses resulting from our routine funding transactions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 resulted in regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding by temporarily enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances and increasing insurance on bank deposits.\nThese programs have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation are periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress that, if encacted, could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nRegulatory uncertainty caused by financial deregulation measures proposed by the Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s short-term legislative agenda includes certain deregulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry, including changes to the Volcker Rule, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Basel III capital requirements, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (the \u201cFSOC\u2019s\u201d) authority and other aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review U.S. financial laws and regulations in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order. Limited scope financial services legislation enacted into law in May 2018 made some changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and other banking laws that were deregulatory in nature, but overall did not have a material impact on banking organizations with the Corporation\u2019s business and risk profile.\nWhile the Senate is controlled by the Republican party, the Democratic party has control of the House of Representatives. In turn, whether additional financial services legislation will be enacted in the current session of Congress or signed by the president remains unclear. In the absence of legislative change, the Trump administration may seek to influence the substance of regulatory supervision through, among other things, the appointment of individuals to the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the CFPB. The administration nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, and Randal Quarles as a Governor and new Vice Chairman for Supervision. Further, President Trump is expected to nominate persons to fill other of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s seven seats. In turn, the appointment of new Federal Reserve Board members may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will modify the capital and liquidity requirements for U.S. banking organizations to levels that are more stringent than those that have been agreed upon at the international level, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s Basel III framework. The Trump administration also nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Jelena McWilliams, a former Senate Banking Committee senior staff member and banking industry executive, as Chair of the FDIC.\nIn addition, the Trump administration nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Kathy Kraninger, a former senior official at the Office of Management and Budget, as the new permanent director of the CFPB. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who, prior to Ms. Kraninger\u2019s appointment, was acting Director of the CFPB, took actions as acting Director that were largely consistent with the announced deregulatory agenda of the Trump administration and Ms. Kraninger may elect to continue pursuing that agenda. The impact of these and other future actions on the CFPB\u2019s regulatory and enforcement activities as they affect FirstBank, however, cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time.\nDetermining the full extent of the impact on us of any such potential financial reform legislation, or whether any such particular proposal will become law, or the impact of regulatory changes in the absence of legislation at this point in time is highly speculative. However, any such changes may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or Board or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted.\nFinancial services legislation and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations and on our credit ratings.\nAs discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations developed, and to be developed, thereunder include or will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike. In addition, U.S. banking organizations, including the Corporation and FirstBank, are subject to stringent regulatory capital requirements that generally increase the amounts of capital that we need to hold, as compared to pre-Dodd-Frank Act requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $178.6 million in TRuPs that are now subject to the full phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.\nAlthough First BanCorp. and FirstBank were able to meet general well-capitalized capital ratios upon implementation of the requirements, and we expect both companies will continue to exceed the minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements for well-capitalized status under the current capital rules, we cannot assure that we will remain at such levels.\nAdditional regulatory proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, could change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The ultimate effect that such legislation, if enacted, or regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, the Corporation and our banking subsidiary must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain certain capital levels, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements for bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or any of the other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of our compliance with trade and economic sanctions requirements and rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nIssuance of additional equity securities in the public markets and other capital management or business strategies that we may pursue could depress the market price of our common stock and could result in dilution of the interest of holders of our common stock.\nGenerally, we are not restricted from issuing additional equity securities, including common stock. We may choose to sell additional equity securities, or we could be required in the future to identify, consider and pursue additional capital management strategies to bolster our capital position. We may issue equity securities (including convertible securities, preferred securities, and options and warrants on our common or preferred stock securities) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, such as to make acquisitions, adjust our leverage ratio, address regulatory capital concerns, or restructure currently outstanding debt or equity securities. Future issuances of our equity securities, including common stock, in any transaction that we may pursue may dilute the interests of our existing holders of our common stock and preferred stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe stock markets have frequently experienced high levels of volatility since 2008. These market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and volatility because of factors specifically related to our businesses and may continue to fluctuate or may decline.\nFactors that could cause fluctuations, volatility or a decline in the market price of our common stock, many of which could be beyond our control, include the following:\n\uf0b7uncertainties and developments related to the resolution of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal problems;\n\uf0b7any regulatory actions against us;\n\uf0b7changes or perceived changes in the condition, operations, results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes;\n\uf0b7announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, including any failures of banks;\n\uf0b7changes in governmental regulations or proposals, or new governmental regulations or proposals, affecting us;\n\uf0b7a continuing recession in the Puerto Rico market and a lack of growth in our other principal markets in the USVI, the BVI and the U.S.;\n\uf0b7the departure of key employees;\n\uf0b7changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets;\n\uf0b7operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\uf0b7operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\uf0b7failure to obtain the regulatory approvals in connection with the pending acquisition of BSPR or failures to effectively complete the integration of operations and personnel of BSPR into FirstBank; and\n\uf0b7the public perception of the banking industry and its safety and soundness.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the other trading markets for the securities of commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or Puerto Rico\u2019s economic environment. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nSuspension of dividends may adversely affect our stock price and could result in the expansion of our Board of Directors.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy. If the Corporation does not pay preferred dividends in full for eighteen monthly dividend periods (whether consecutive or not), the holders of the Series A through E Preferred Stock as to which dividends have not been paid for eighteen-months, acting as a single class, will be entitled to appoint two additional members to our Board of Directors. Any member of the Board of Directors appointed by the holders of Series A through E Preferred Stock is required to vacate his or her office if the Corporation resumes the payment of dividends in full for twelve consecutive monthly dividend periods.", "PERMNO": 11018, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBP"}
