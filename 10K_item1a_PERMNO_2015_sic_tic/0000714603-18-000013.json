{"cik": "714603", "company": "DST SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or share price in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nTrends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services and the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant clients could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients primarily in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, other financial service (e.g., insurance, banking and financial planning), healthcare and pharmacy industries. Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons. If demand for our products or services decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 23.7% of our consolidated operating revenues. For the same period, the Healthcare Services segment\u2019s five largest clients accounted for approximately 48.7% of our revenues in that segment, including 18.6% from its largest clients. Because of our significant client concentration, particularly in the Healthcare Services segment, our revenues could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant clients, and a delay or default in payment by any significant client could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nEvents that adversely affect our clients\u2019 businesses, rates of growth or numbers of clients they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process. Events that could adversely affect our clients\u2019 businesses include decreased demand for our clients\u2019 products and services, adverse conditions in our clients\u2019 markets or adverse economic conditions generally. We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential clients will accept our products or services. We also may invest in technology or infrastructure for specific clients and not realize additional revenue from such investments. If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or those of third parties on which we rely could result in significant costs and reputational damage.\nWe have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters. In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or for resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns, or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches or breaches of our environments and procedures or those of our vendors, could result in significant data losses or theft of our or our clients\u2019 intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. Several health care and financial services firms have been victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm. Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches. A cybersecurity breach involving our systems or those of third parties on which we rely could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market\u2019s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.\nThe demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients\u2019 technology and capacity requirements.\nOur clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate. Our processes to support the design, set-up, quality assurance, and maintenance activities for the timely implementation of new client services, migration of existing clients onto new or different platforms, and ongoing servicing may not meet the needs of our business and clients. We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet client requirements for technology and capacity. If we do not meet clients\u2019 technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our information technology transformation initiative will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation; performance of third-parties; upgrade requirements; and availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such transformation.\nWe must continually invest in our information technology in order to continually meet our clients\u2019 needs. We are implementing a multi-year information technology transformation initiative intended to reduce operating costs, increase information security, upgrade infrastructure, expand automation, provide access to emerging technologies and position us to take advantage of market opportunities. If we fail to provide an enhanced client experience with this initiative, our ability to retain and attract clients and to maintain and grow revenues could be adversely affected. Using new and sophisticated technology on a very large scale entails risks. For example, deployment of new software may adversely affect the performance of existing services on our existing platforms and decrease the client experience. If implementation of our information technology transformation initiative results in delayed services or costs of the initiative exceed expected amounts, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material. If the delivery of services expected to be deployed on modernized architecture were delayed due to technological constraints, performance of third-party suppliers, or other reasons, the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected, which could result in higher costs to clients, potentially resulting in decisions to purchase services from our competitors, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow from operations.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nOur business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses. We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire. We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses. Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance. Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management\u2019s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business. The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require a significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in continued responsibility for the divested business, including through indemnification, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIf our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe have invested, and continue to invest heavily in our technology to improve existing products and services and add new products and services to address the needs of existing or new clients. Our investments may not lead to successful deployment or increases in the number of accounts or transactions. If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales or reducing expenses, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.\nAn increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues.\nWe service open-end and closed-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, interval funds and exchange-listed closed-end funds, as well as private funds, collective investment trusts and other accounts under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements which we refer to as registered accounts. These arrangements are distinguished from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer. Our clients may adopt the broker subaccount structure. We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform shareowner subaccounting. As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis. Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our clients to use a broker subaccount structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues. While subaccounting conversions have generally been limited to our non tax-advantaged mutual fund accounts, such conversions have begun to extend to the tax-advantaged accounts (such as retirement and Section 529 accounts) we service, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nConsolidation in or among our clients and potential clients could result in a reduction of clients or reduction in use of our products or services.\nMergers or acquisitions of or consolidations among our clients or between our clients and other entities could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients and result in the discontinuation or reduction in use of our products or services. This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of clients or the activities of the consolidated entities. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to substantial competition.\nWe are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve. Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures. Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing and recordkeeping services they have paid us to perform. Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.\nIn the financial and healthcare markets we serve, we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products or services offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and other intermediary relationships, quality of service, and level of fees charged for products and services. We continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products and services offered.\nOur failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. Competition could also affect the revenue mix of products or services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.\nWe may not be able to sustain critical operations and provide essential products and services during system failures or catastrophic events.\nDamage to our systems or facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could impact our operations or financial condition. The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers, including facilities provided by third parties on which we rely. Significant damage to any of our operating facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve clients. Moreover, in the event of a catastrophic event we may not be able to execute our business resumption strategies for data processing and capabilities, and we may not have the ability to recover critical data, programs, applications, and data processing capabilities in a timely manner; any of these could impact our ability to serve our clients. In addition, it is possible that hardware failures or errors or technical deficiencies in our systems or those of third parties on which we rely could similarly result in data loss or corruption. Any failure of our systems or facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could expose us to liability and damages relating to such failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate internationally and are thus exposed to currency fluctuations and foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.\nInherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and also could adversely affect our ability to receive important support from our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide. We may also have difficulty repatriating any profits or be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in our international business.\nAs a result of the December 2016 referendum in the U.K. to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), the value of the British pound has fluctuated greatly as compared to the US dollar. The relative strengthening of the dollar relative to the British pound may adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Any withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union could significantly disrupt the movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union; the financial services industry could be particularly sensitive to Brexit and it could result in increased legal and regulatory complexities for our operations. There can be no assurance that these disruptions and regulatory changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nVarious events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.\nWe may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results. Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address. We incur significant costs to develop products and services used to service our existing and potential client operations. The timing of these expenses may fluctuate as new client contracts are signed or existing client contracts are renewed or terminated, causing our results to vary accordingly. Factors contributing to the variability of our results include increased costs of supplies, increased costs relating to existing and potential client operations, and hiring staff to develop new and existing products. The timing of our fees associated with new and existing client contracts, including changes in recognition as a result of changes in accounting principles, may also cause results to vary from period to period.\nOur revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.\nWe generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn for our products and services. These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients\u2019 customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors. We could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatile markets as certain of our fees are tied to the asset bases of our clients. The occurrence of significant market volatility or decreased levels of participation would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations. Additionally, we may be exposed to operational or other risks in connection with any systematic failures in the markets, or the default due to market-related failures of one or more counterparties with whom we transact.\nWe also derive significant revenues from asset management, administration and distribution contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the fees paid to us are based on a variety of factors, including the market value of assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d), assets under administration (\u201cAUA\u201d) and number of transactions processed. AUM, AUA or the number of transactions processed may decline for various reasons, causing results to vary. Factors that could decrease AUM and AUA\n(and therefore revenues) include declines in the market value of the assets in the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifts among, the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, as well as market conditions generally.\nOur revenues may decrease due to changes in asset management, administration and distribution fees and industry trends.\nThe asset management, administration and distribution business is highly competitive and we compete for investors and clients on the basis of factors such as performance, reputation, service, and cost. Underperformance of any of our proprietary and client products and services, damage to our reputation, or service-related issues could lead to redemptions or terminations. Additionally, the asset management industry has generally been subject to fee compression and asset flows to lower cost products or services. Such a trend may result in fee compression in asset management, administration and distribution related contracts. The asset management, administration and distribution contracts may be terminated by the parties thereto, and the board of directors or trustees of certain funds may terminate investment management, administration and distribution agreements for any reason and without penalty. The factors and trends described above could have a material adverse effect on revenues.\nInvestment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including those held by us and as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.\nAs part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds. Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances. Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues. The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss. Any substantial loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.\nOperational errors in the performance of our services or contractual obligations, as well as unknown or undetected defects, could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.\nThe failure to properly perform our services or contractual obligations could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors. Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services, which could cause us to compromise client data, lose revenues, lose clients, divert development resources, or damage our reputation, any of which could harm our business.\nOur revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.\nWe derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under multi-year contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services. We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire. Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice. Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.\nWe are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.\nWe have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent. Businesses we acquire also often depend on intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and, ultimately, our business. Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent available, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws; however, significant portions of our proprietary intellectual property are not protected by patents. We also utilize nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology. We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective. Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology. The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us. We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend. Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us. Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur investments in funds and our joint ventures could decline in value.\nFrom time to time we add new investment strategies to our investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investments as \u201cseed capital.\u201d The seed capital investments may decline in value. A significant decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments. These investments are illiquid. Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted. Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities. Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so. We may not always be able to sell those investments at the same or higher prices than we paid for them. We also participate in joint ventures with other companies. These joint venture investments could require further capital contributions.\nWe have restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. If we do not comply with these restrictive covenants, our failure could result in material and adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary investments, and asset dispositions, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our debt agreements could result in a cross default under one or more of our other debt agreements, including our financing agreements. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operation.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nWe and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to regulation. Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.\nA number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, retirement, data protection, reporting and related regulations. New products and services we plan to offer may also be subject to regulation, either directly or as a downstream provider to customers or clients. Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of clients\u2019 funds and securities, use of client and employee data, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, healthcare, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions, damage our reputation, the revocation of licenses, censures, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results. Governmental changes, changing interpretation of regulations, and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business, result in penalties, or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting mutual fund service providers, which could adversely affect our business. The Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) issued fiduciary regulations in 2016 that, if not delayed, repealed or substantially altered in the near future, are likely to impact our business.\nThe SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party service providers of mutual funds and other fund-types products, such as distributors, administrators, or custodians, (collectively referred to as \u201cmutual funds\u201d), which\ncould adversely affect our business. The SEC may issue additional regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale. Additionally, many brokers and financial intermediaries have become subject to a new DOL-imposed fiduciary standard-of-care that is causing them to review, and may impact, their methods of distribution, share class structures, and/or wholesaling activities. Although the DOL rule is fully effective, the current administration has delayed implementation of the best interest contract exemption, providing an extended transition period for distributors to address their new fiduciary status. It remains unclear whether the regulations will be replaced by an SEC standard, repealed or substantially altered within the near future. We cannot predict all of the requirements the SEC or FINRA may impose. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the SEC or FINRA proposal will provide a unified standard with the DOL rule, or whether it will provide a patchwork of standards that depend on the type of account in which the retirement assets are invested. Additionally, while the industry would prefer a united federal fiduciary standard, individual states such as Nevada, New York and Maryland have recently begun to explore their own legislative options to provide a fiduciary standard for investment advice. Regulations that cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could decrease the number of accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients. The fiduciary regulations are expected to primarily impact brokers and registered investment advisers who give individualized non-discretionary advice in the \u201cretail\u201d marketplace, but discretionary investment managers in the \u201cinstitutional\u201d space are also expected to be affected, primarily in connection with the sale of investment products and services. To the extent that our business units, clients, unaffiliated intermediary partners and retirement plan service providers fit into these categories, this could adversely affect our business and operating results. Additionally, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act and/or DOL regulations impact the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass through increased costs to us or they may reduce their transactional volume which is a primary source of our revenues.\nOur clients are subject to regulation that could affect our business.\nOur clients are subject to extensive regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to products and services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry. Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the products and services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide our products and services to such industries. Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations. For example, our accounts in our Healthcare Services segment are impacted by the Affordable Care Act, including the Health Insurance Marketplace. Changes to the Affordable Care Act may be enacted by Congress in response to the current administration\u2019s stated agenda, and we cannot predict the impact that will have on our clients and their demand for our products and services.\nOur businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.\nOur proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs. The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services. In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client\u2019s instructions or meet specifications. Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients\u2019 agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties. We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform. We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement. Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue. Litigation could include class action claims based upon, among other theories, various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action. Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our products and services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.\nChanges in tax laws, including the recently enacted federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d), as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate in 2018 and thereafter.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in federal and various state jurisdictions. We are currently evaluating the Tax Act with our professional advisers. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and have included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. In addition, because of the uncertainties relating to the future application of the Tax Act and actions we may take in the future, the effect of the Tax Act on us in 2018 and future years may change significantly and cannot be predicted.\nWe are subject to audits by tax authorities from time to time in federal and state jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Corporate Governance or our Equity Securities\nWe do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.\nWe invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses. Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions. The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own. Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial results.\nSome of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which could, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.\nWe own interests in unconsolidated entities and various real estate joint ventures. Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which could restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so. These arrangements could also allow us to purchase the other owners\u2019 interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so. The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.\nIn addition, some of the agreements governing our joint venture arrangements include buy/sell provisions that provide a party to the arrangement with the option to purchase the other party\u2019s interests upon such other party\u2019s change of control at a purchase price that may be less than fair market value. For instance, consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of the Company under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control. Book value may be substantially less than fair market value at the time of any sale of our interests upon a change of control.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nThe provisions include:\n\u2022\nsuper-majority stockholder approval required for certain actions;\n\u2022\nspecific procedures for stockholders to nominate new directors;\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s authority to issue and set the terms of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nvarious rights of joint venture co-owners and contractual counterparties, including rights of lenders and certain clients and executives in the event of a change in control;\n\u2022\npublic reporting of ownership and of changes in ownership by stockholders with at least a 5% interest in us; and\n\u2022\nlegal restrictions on business combinations with certain stockholders.\nBecause of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.\nA change in control of the Company could trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with certain clients and other agreements. A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software. Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual\u2019s termination of employment without \u201ccause\u201d or resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting of equity grants, as applicable, under such agreements and programs. This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee\u2019s incentive to continue employment with us. We have adopted an executive severance plan which, among other things, provides benefits to participating senior officers and executives who are terminated in connection with a change of control. Certain other executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control. The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nFuture cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements. We are currently precluded from declaring dividends pursuant to the definitive Merger Agreement with SS&C, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, \u201cDescription of Business.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Proposed Merger Transaction with SS&C\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that the Merger will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the Merger. Our ability to consummate the Merger is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks that the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied, or if possible, waived, including, among others, (a) receipt of the approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote (the \u201cCompany Stockholder Approval\u201d); (b) receipt of certain regulatory approvals; and (c) the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the Merger. The process to obtain the requisite approvals could prevent, or substantially delay, the consummation of the Merger.\nThe closing of the Merger is also dependent on the accuracy of representations and warranties made by the parties to the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers and other customary exceptions), the performance in all material respects by the parties of obligations imposed under the Merger Agreement and the receipt of officer certificates by the other party certifying the satisfaction of the preceding conditions. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether or when the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or as to whether or when the Merger will be consummated.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, various approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objection must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each party has agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other party in taking any and all actions, and to do all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable, to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining any requisite approvals. These approvals include approval of, or under, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, approval under the competition law of Ireland and approvals of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the Central Bank of Ireland and Luxembourg\u2019s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier.\nThese regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals and if such regulatory and governmental entities seek to impose such conditions, lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, SS&C and DST. Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger and such conditions may not be satisfied for an extended period of time.\nWe cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all, or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of regulatory remedies on the completion\nof the Merger, including requiring changes to the terms of the Merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the closing of the Merger not being satisfied.\nThe special meeting of our stockholders at which the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement will be considered may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before regulatory remedies, if any, are known. In this event, if the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, we and SS&C may subsequently agree to regulatory remedies without further seeking stockholder approval, even if such regulatory remedies could have an adverse effect on us, SS&C or the combined company, except as required by applicable law.\nThe Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pursue other alternatives to the Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay SS&C a termination fee of $165.0 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative proposal. Further, subject to limited exceptions, consistent with applicable law, the Merger Agreement provides that our Board of Directors will not fail to make, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to SS&C, its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of approving the Merger. Although our Board of Directors is permitted to take certain actions in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if it determines that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, doing so in specified situations could require us to pay SS&C a termination fee. There also is a risk that the requirement to pay the termination fee to SS&C in certain circumstances may result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger will not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated if the Merger is not consummated on or before July 11, 2018 (subject to extension to November 11, 2018 by either party if all conditions are satisfied other than regulatory approvals) or if the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained. In addition, SS&C and DST may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, including by SS&C if DST\u2019s Board of Directors shall have changed its recommendation to stockholders and by DST in order to enter into an agreement providing for a superior proposal.\nUpon a termination of the Merger Agreement due to entry into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, and as a result of DST\u2019s Board of Directors making a change of recommendation prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, we will be required to pay SS&C a termination fee of $165.0 million.\nFailure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact DST and our future operations.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Our business may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Merger, (ii) payment of certain significant transaction costs relating to the Merger without receiving the anticipated benefits and (iii) the focus of our management on the Merger for an extended period of time rather than on other management opportunities or other beneficial opportunities for our Company. The market price of Company common stock may also decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nWe may be negatively impacted if the Merger Agreement is terminated and DST seeks but is unable to find another business combination or strategic transaction offering equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Merger, or if we become subject to litigation related to entering into or failing to consummate the Merger, including direct actions by our stockholders against the directors and/or officers for breaches of fiduciary duty or derivative actions brought by our stockholders. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, clients and employees in the event the Merger is not consummated.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions until the Merger is consummated.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on clients, counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties could disrupt our business and cause clients, suppliers, vendors, partners and others that deal with us to defer entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us. These uncertainties may also impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us, without the consent of SS&C, from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to and/or following the completion of the Merger and could limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nCompletion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which DST is a party.\nThe completion of the transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which DST is a party. If SS&C and DST are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if SS&C and DST are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DST.\nFor example, consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of the Company under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, which may be substantially less than fair market value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. A material portion of these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed.\nFurther, while we have assumed that a certain amount of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by DST. These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of our operations prior to the Merger.\nAny legal proceedings in connection with the Merger could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.\nTransactions such as the Merger often give rise to lawsuits by stockholders or other third parties. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no judgment, order, injunction, ruling or decree, preliminary, temporary or permanent, or other legal restraint or prohibition and no action, proceeding, binding order or determination by any governmental entity, will be in effect preventing or otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Merger. In connection with the Merger, plaintiffs may file lawsuits against us and/or our directors and officers in connection with the Merger. Such legal proceedings could also prevent or delay the completion of the Merger and result in additional costs. In addition, if any lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us or SS&C from consummating the Merger on the agreed upon terms, the injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. If the Merger is prevented or delayed, the lawsuits could result in substantial costs, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Merger without resoliciting the Company Stockholder Approval.\nWe may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Merger, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. We will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver and its effect on our stockholders in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this proxy statement and resolicitation of proxies is required or warranted. In some cases, if our Board determines that such a waiver is warranted but that such waiver or its effect on our stockholders is not sufficiently material to warrant resolicitation of proxies, we have the discretion to complete the Merger without seeking further stockholder approval. Any determination whether to waive any condition to the Merger or as to resoliciting stockholder approval or amending this proxy statement as a result of a waiver will be made by us at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.\nThe opinion of our financial advisor will not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.\nWe have not obtained an updated opinion in connection with the Merger from our financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (\u201cBofA Merrill Lynch\u201d), as of the date of this Form 10-K and do not expect to receive an updated opinion prior to the completion of the Merger. Changes in our operations and prospects, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control, and on which the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch was based, may significantly alter the value of our Company or the price of our common stock by the time the Merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of the opinion. Because BofA Merrill Lynch will not be updating its opinion, which was issued in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 11, 2018, the opinion will not address the fairness of the Merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed.", "PERMNO": 83186, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "DST"}
