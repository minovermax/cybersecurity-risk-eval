Risk factors\nIn addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nGeneral economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture weakness or deteriorating conditions in the U.S. or global economy that result in reduction of vehicle production and sales by our customers may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, we may experience increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover.\nDeteriorating economic conditions impact driving habits of both consumers and commercial operators, leading to a reduction in miles driven. If total miles driven decreases, demand for our aftermarket products could decline due to a reduction in the need for replacement parts.\nDifficult economic conditions may cause changes to the business models, products, financial condition, consumer financing and rebate programs of the OEMs. This could reduce the number of vehicles produced and purchased, which would, in turn, reduce the demand for both our OEM and aftermarket products. Our contracts do not require our customers to purchase any minimum volume of our products.\nRecent economic conditions have generally increased the availability of capital and decreased the cost of financing. If we, our customers or our suppliers experience a material tightening in the availability of credit, it could adversely affect us. Among other possible effects, we may have to pay suppliers in advance or on short credit terms, which would harm our liquidity or lead to production interruptions.\nRisks specific to the light and commercial vehicle industries affect our business.\nOur operations, and, in particular, our OE business, are inherently cyclical and depend on many industry-specific factors such as:\n\u2022\ncredit availability and interest rates;\n\u2022\nfuel prices and availability;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence, spending and preference;\n\u2022\ncosts related to environmental hazards;\n\u2022\ngovernmental incentives; and\n\u2022\npolitical volatility.\nOur business may also be adversely affected by regulatory requirements, trade agreements, our customers' labor relations issues, reduced demand for our customers' product programs that we currently support, the receipt of sales orders for new or redesigned products that replace our current product programs and other factors. The current political environment has led, and may lead in the future, to further federal, state and local government budget cuts. We have in the past received governmental grants that benefit our industry. A significant adverse change in any of these factors may reduce automotive production and sales by our customers, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInventory levels and our OE customers' production levels also affect our OE sales. We cannot predict when our customers either increase or reduce inventory levels. This may result in variability in our sales and financial condition. Uncertainty regarding inventory levels may be exacerbated by our customers or governments initiating or terminating consumer financing programs.\nLonger useful product life of parts may reduce aftermarket demand for some of our products.\nIn 2014 and 2013, roughly half of our net sales were to aftermarket customers. The average useful life of automotive parts has been steadily increasing in recent years due to improved quality and innovations in products and technologies. The longer product lives allow vehicle owners to replace parts of their vehicles less often. Additional increases in the average useful life of automotive parts are likely to reduce the demand for our aftermarket products, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, litigation and other disputes and claims.\nWe are exposed to warranty and product liability claims if our products fail to perform as expected. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to participate in a recall of those products. If public safety concerns are raised, we may have to participate in a recall even if our products are ultimately found not to be defective. Vehicle manufacturers have experienced increasing recall campaigns in recent years. Our customers and other OEMs are increasingly looking to us and other suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. If our customers demand higher warranty-related cost recoveries, or if our products fail to perform as expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer.\nWe may also be exposed to product liability claims, warranty claims and damage to our reputation if our products (including the parts of our products produced by third-party suppliers) actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage. Recalls may also cause us to lose additional business from our customers. Material product defect issues may subject us to recalls of those products and restrictions on bidding on new customer programs. We have in the past incurred, and could in the future incur, material warranty or product liability losses and costs to defend these claims.\nWe are also involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. See Note 20 of notes to financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any of these legal proceedings, and future legal proceedings may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the cost and availability of raw materials and supplied components could harm our financial performance.\nWe purchase raw materials and component parts from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials and component parts may change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, increased demand from the automotive sector and the broader economy, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. In recent years, market conditions have caused significant increases in the price of some raw materials and component parts and, in some cases, reductions in short-term availability. We are especially susceptible to changes in the price and availability of copper, aluminum, steel and certain rare earth magnets. The price of these materials has fluctuated significantly in recent years. An increase in the price of these magnets, or a reduction in their supply, could harm our business.\nRaw material price inflation and availability have been a significant operational and financial burdens on automotive suppliers at all levels. Our need to maintain a continuing supply of raw materials and components makes it difficult to resist price increases and surcharges imposed by our suppliers. Further, it is difficult to pass cost increases through\nto our customers, and, if passed through, recovery is typically delayed. Because the recognition of the cost/benefit and the price recovery/reduction do not occur in the same period, the impact of a change in commodity cost is not necessarily offset by the change in sales price in the same period. Accordingly, a change in the supply of, or price for, raw materials and components could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our or our customers' supply chain may harm our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and materials. In order to reduce costs, our industry has been rationalizing and consolidating its supply base. Suppliers may delay deliveries to us due to failures caused by production issues, and they may also deliver non-conforming products. Additionally, disruption in the transportation of goods, such as the recent issues with ports in the U.S. and Brazil, may result in additional costs or delays in delivery of products.\nIf one of our suppliers experiences a supply shortage or disruption, we may be unable to procure the components from another source to produce the affected products. The lack of a subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products could force us to cease production. Shortages and disruptions could be caused by many problems, such as closures of one of our suppliers' plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval, or logistical complications due to weather, natural disasters, mechanical failures or delayed customs processing. Also, we and our suppliers deliver products on a just-in-time basis, which is designed to maintain low inventory levels but increases the risk of supply disruptions.\nProducts delivered by our suppliers may fail to meet quality standards. Potential quality issues could force us to halt deliveries while we revalidate the affected products. When deliveries are not timely, we have to absorb the cost of identifying and solving the problem, as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. We may also incur costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight. Our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their suppliers fails to deliver necessary components. This may cause our customers to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In turn, if we cause a customer to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup its losses and expenses from us, which could be significant or include consequential losses.\nShortages of and volatility in the price of oil may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price and availability of oil impacts our business in numerous ways. Oil prices are very volatile. In general an increase in oil prices, or a shortage of oil, may reduce demand for vehicles or shift demand to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, which provide lower profit margins. Also, an increase in oil prices may reduce the average number of miles driven. Lower vehicle demand or average number of miles driven would, in turn, reduce the demand for both our OE and aftermarket products. An increase in the price of oil could also increase the cost of the plastic components we use in our products. Conversely, lower fuel prices may negatively impact demand for hybrid-powered vehicles, which may also adversely affect our business. Accordingly, shortages and volatility in the price of oil may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss or the deteriorating financial condition of a major customer could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our sales are to automotive and heavy-duty OEMs, OEM dealer networks, automotive parts retail chains and warehouse distributors. We depend on a small number of customers with strong purchasing power. Our five largest customers represented 44% and 47% of our net sales for 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, Hyundai became our largest customer and accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. GM, our second largest customer, accounted for 12% and 16% of our net sales for 2014 and 2013, respectively. OE and OES customers accounted for 58% and 60% of our net sales for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOne or more of our top customers may cease to require all or any portion of the products or services we currently provide or may develop alternative sources, including their own in-house operations, for those products or services.\nCustomers may restructure, which could include significant capacity reductions or reorganization under bankruptcy laws. The loss of any of our major customers, reduction in their demand for our products or substantial restructuring activities by our major customers could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition. Our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.\nThe automotive industry is highly competitive. We and most of our competitors are seeking to expand market share with new and existing customers. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, service, delivery, manufacturing and distribution capability, design and technology. Our competitors' efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Overseas manufacturers, particularly those located in China, are increasing their operations and could become a significant competitive force in the future. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain low-cost manufacturing, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, which would lower our margins. Our business may also suffer if we fail to meet customer requirements.\nSome of our competitors may have advantages over us, which could affect our ability to compete effectively. For example, some of our competitors:\n\u2022\nare divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do;\n\u2022\nare affiliated with OEMs or have a \u201cpreferred status\u201d as a result of special relationships with certain customers;\n\u2022\nhave economic advantages as compared to our business, such as patents and existing underutilized capacity; and\n\u2022\nare domiciled in areas that we are targeting for growth.\nOEMs and suppliers are developing strategies to reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage. These strategies include supply base consolidation and global sourcing. The consolidation trend among automotive parts suppliers is resulting in fewer, larger suppliers who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. If we cannot achieve cost savings and operational improvements sufficient to allow us to compete favorably in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer due to a reduction of, or inability to increase, sales sufficient to offset other price increases.\nOur competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than we can or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving regulatory, industry or customer requirements.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our operations.\nSome of our employees, a substantial number of the employees of our largest customers, the employees of our suppliers and the employees of other suppliers to the automotive industry are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements. To our knowledge, approximately 3,400 of our employees globally are represented by trade unions. Difficult conditions in the light and commercial vehicle industries and actions taken by us, our customers, our suppliers and other suppliers to address negative industry conditions may have the side effect of exacerbating labor relations problems, which could increase the possibility of work stoppages.\nWe may not be able to negotiate acceptable contracts with unions, and our failure to do so may result in work stoppages. We have agreements with a number of unions in different countries. These agreements expire or are subject to renewal at various times. One or more of these unions could elect not to renew its contract with us. Also, work stoppages at our customers, our suppliers or other suppliers to the automotive industry could cause us to shut down our production facilities or prevent us from meeting our delivery obligations to our customers. The industry's reliance on just-in-time delivery of components could also worsen the effects of any work stoppage. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, or the facilities of suppliers and our customers, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success partly depends on our development of improved technology-based products and our ability to adapt to changing technology.\nSome of our products are subject to changing technology or may become less desirable or be rendered obsolete by changes in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements. Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these changes. We may be unable to achieve and maintain the technological advances, machinery and knowledge that may be necessary for us to remain competitive.\nWe may need to incur capital expenditures and invest in research and development and manufacturing in amounts exceeding our current expectations. We may decide to develop specific technologies and capabilities in anticipation of customers' demands for new innovations and technologies. If this demand does not materialize, then we may be unable to recover the costs incurred to develop those particular technologies and capabilities. If we are unable to recover these costs, or if any development programs do not progress as expected, our business could materially suffer.\nTo compete, we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers' demand in a timely manner. However, we may be unable to install and certify the equipment needed to manufacture products for new programs in time for the start of production. Transitioning our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs may impact production rates and other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. Our customers may not launch new product programs on schedule. Our failure to successfully launch new products, a delay by our customers in introducing our new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance of our customers' vehicles or of our products, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. Further, we may be unable to adequately protect our technological developments, which could prevent us from maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage.\nA failure to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel could harm our ability to operate effectively.\nOur ability to operate our business and implement our strategies effectively partly depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel in key areas, including engineering, sales and marketing, operations, information technology and finance. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to take advantage of, or successfully complete, potential acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, business combinations or joint ventures that we believe present opportunities to enhance our market position, extend our technological and manufacturing capabilities or realize significant synergies, operating expense reductions or overhead cost savings. This strategy will partly depend on whether suitable acquisition targets or joint ventures are available on acceptable terms and our ability to finance the purchase price of acquisitions or the investment in joint ventures. We may also be unable to take advantage of potential acquisitions, business combinations or joint ventures because of regulatory or other concerns. For example, the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to engage in certain mergers or similar transactions.\nAcquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures may expose us to additional risks.\nAny acquisition, business combination or joint venture that we engage in could present a variety of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense and amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives;\n\u2022\nour failure to discover liabilities of the acquired company for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, despite any investigation we make before the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from our core operations as they attend to any business integration issues that may arise;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel of the acquired company or joint venture counterparty;\n\u2022\nour becoming subject to material liabilities as a result of failure to negotiate adequate indemnification rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in combining the standards, processes, procedures and controls of the new business with those of our existing operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in coordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating product technologies; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nOur failure to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and losses, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may enter into joint ventures in the future. Our interests may not always be aligned with the interests of our joint venture partners. For example, our partners may negotiate on behalf of customers of the joint venture for sales terms that are not in the best interest of the joint venture. Our joint venture partner could own a business that competes with the joint venture and our businesses. Accordingly, there may be a misalignment of incentives between us and our joint venture partners that could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lean manufacturing and other cost saving plans may not be effective.\nOur operations strategy includes goals such as improving inventory management, customer delivery, plant and distribution facility consolidation and the integration of back-office functions across our businesses. If we are unable to realize anticipated benefits from these measures, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Moreover, the implementation of cost-saving plans and facilities integration may disrupt our operations and financial performance.\nOur global operations subject us to risks and uncertainties.\nWe have business and technical offices and manufacturing facilities in many countries, including Brazil, China, Hungary, Mexico, South Korea and Tunisia, which may have less developed political and economic environments than the United States. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;\n\u2022\nagreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables may be difficult to collect through a foreign country's legal system;\n\u2022\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose burdensome tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment (such as repatriation restrictions or requirements, quotas, exchange controls and anti-dumping duties);\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be difficult;\n\u2022\ncompliance with international tax laws may be burdensome and result in additional costs and possibly fines;\n\u2022\noverlap of different tax structures may subject us to additional taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions, including tariffs and embargoes;\n\u2022\nshutdowns or delays at international borders;\n\u2022\nmore expansive rights of foreign labor unions;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation and other governmental action;\n\u2022\npolitical and civil instability;\n\u2022\ndomestic or international terrorist events, wars and other hostilities;\n\u2022\nlaws governing international relations (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.S. Export Administration Act); and\n\u2022\nglobal operations may strain our internal control over financial reporting or cause us to expend additional resources to keep those controls effective.\nIf certain of the risks described above were to occur, we may decide to shift some of our operations from one jurisdiction to another, which could result in added costs. If we acquire new businesses, we may be unable to effectively and quickly implement pre-existing controls and procedures intended to mitigate these uncertainties and risks. The longer supply chains resulting from global operations may also increase our working capital requirements. These uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will partly depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.\nInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government's adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are accordingly subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. These risks and exposures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ntransaction exposure, which arises when the cost of a product originates in one currency and the product is sold in another currency;\n\u2022\ntranslation exposure on our income statement, which arises when the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars; and\n\u2022\ntranslation exposure on our balance sheet, which arises when the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars.\nWe source many of our parts, components and finished products from Mexico, Europe, North Africa and Asia. The cost of these products could fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange rates could also affect product demand and require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 35% of our net sales in both years were transacted outside the United States. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.\nHistorically, there have been extreme and unprecedented volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations may occur again and may impact our financial results. We cannot predict when, or if, this volatility will cease or the extent of its impact on our future financial results. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations may therefore materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future growth will be influenced by the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles.\nOur growth will be influenced by the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, and we are subject to the risk of any reduced demand for hybrid or electric vehicles. If customers do not adopt hybrid and electric vehicles, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. The market for hybrid and electric vehicles is relatively new and rapidly evolving and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing customer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nperceptions about hybrid vehicle and electric vehicle quality, safety, design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events occur that are linked to the quality or safety of hybrid or electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe availability of vehicles using alternative technologies or fuel sources;\n\u2022\nperceptions about, and the actual cost of purchasing and operating, vehicles using alternative technologies or fuel sources;\n\u2022\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u2022\nthe availability of service for hybrid and electric vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe environmental consciousness of customers;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and diesel;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries, and government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u2022\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate hybrid or electric vehicles or future regulation requiring increased use of non-polluting vehicles; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic factors.\nAdditionally, our customers may become subject to regulations that require them to alter the design of their hybrid or electric vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer interest in their vehicles, resulting in a decline in the demand for our products. The influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers to cease to purchase our products, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEscalating pricing pressures from our customers and other customer requirements may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe automotive industry has been characterized by significant pricing pressure from customers for many years. This trend is partly attributable to the strong purchasing power of major OEMs and aftermarket customers. Virtually all automakers and aftermarket customers have implemented aggressive price reduction initiatives and objectives each year with their suppliers, and we expect these actions to continue in the future. As our customers grow, including through consolidation, their ability to exert pricing pressure increases. Our customers often expect us to quote fixed prices or contractually obligate us to accept prices with annual price reductions. Price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our future profitability will partly depend on our ability to reduce costs. If we are unable to offset customer price reductions through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, technological improvements, sourcing alternatives and other cost reduction initiatives, these price reductions may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur supply agreements with some of our customers require us to provide our products at predetermined prices. In some cases, these prices decline over the course of the contract. The costs that we incur to fulfill these contracts may vary substantially from our initial estimates. Unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors, including increases in the costs of labor, components or materials. Although in some cases we are permitted to pass on to our customers the cost increases associated with specific materials, cost increases that we cannot pass on to our customers could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, consistent with common industry practice, a majority of our aftermarket customers, including both large retail customers and smaller warehouse distributors, require us to agree to terms that reduce the customer's investment in inventory held for sale. These measures include extended payment terms for purchased inventory (often coupled with customer-supplied factoring arrangements), our supply of inventory without a cash deposit in respect of the cores included in the finished goods, and other arrangements. Participation in these initiatives requires us to incur factoring costs and to invest increased financial resources in cores. To the extent these demands increase in number and dollar volume, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if our financing costs increase or we are unable to obtain adequate financing.\nIn addition, certain of our agreements with customers subject us to penalties if we fail to provide a minimum level of order fulfillment. To the extent we are unable to obtain certain materials or remanufacture the products under such contracts or we are unable to maintain necessary inventory levels, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCircumstances over which we have no control may affect our ability to deliver products to customers and the cost of shipping and handling.\nWe rely on third parties to handle and transport components and raw materials to our facilities and finished products to our customers. Due to factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, border crossing difficulties, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, disruptions in transportation infrastructure and acts of God, we may not receive components and raw materials, and may not be able to transport our products to our customers, in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFreight costs are strongly correlated to oil prices, have been volatile in the past and are likely to be volatile in the future. As we incur substantial freight costs to transport materials and components from our suppliers, and to deliver finished\nproducts to our customers, an increase in freight costs could increase our operating costs, which we may be unable to pass to our customers.\nAssertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. There are likely issued patents owned by third parties that may relate to technology used in our industry and to which we do not have licenses. From time to time, third parties may assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. See Note 20 of notes to financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nClaims that our products or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our supply agreements require us to indemnify our customers and distributors from third-party infringement claims, which have in the past required, and may in the future require, that we defend those claims and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. We may not prevail in these proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products or technology;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products or technology;\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nenter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based on our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or\n\u2022\nrelinquish rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if our claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer.\nOur success partly depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, distributors, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. It is possible that:\n\u2022\nour present or future patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights will lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or, in the case of third-party patents licensed or sub-licensed to us, be licensed to others;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights may not provide any competitive advantages to us;\n\u2022\nour pending or future patent applications may not be issued or may not have the coverage we originally sought; and\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak.\nOur competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in the litigation could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are also a party to a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments to the counterparties. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, which we may not be able to do on acceptable terms.\nOur confidentiality agreements with our employees and others may not adequately prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. In order to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, partners, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent the disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Others may also independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret and other proprietary rights, and the failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could harm our competitive position.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur product agreements with certain customers include standard indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify customers for losses as a result of intellectual property infringement claims and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons. To the extent not covered by applicable insurance, a large indemnity payment could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters, and may, from time to time be involved in or the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations. See Note 20 of notes to financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters, or compliance with any governmental or regulatory rules, we may be forced to pay damages or fines and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may become impaired in the future.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and developed technologies. Goodwill, which represents the excess of reorganization value over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was $259.6 million as of December 31, 2014, or 19.7% of our total assets. Other intangible assets, net, were $298.0 million as of December 31, 2014, or 22.6% of our total assets.\nImpairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge that is included in operating income. We are subject to financial statement risk if goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired. See Note 7 of notes to financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nUnexpected changes in core availability or the market value of cores may harm our financial condition.\nCores are used starters or alternators that customers exchange when they purchase new products. If usable, we refurbish these cores into a remanufactured product that we sell to our aftermarket customers. If the availability of usable cores declines, we may have to purchase cores in the open market at values that may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If core market values decline below cost, then we would record a charge against our operating income for the devaluation of core inventory. This devaluation may harm our results of operations.\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing:\n\u2022\ndischarges of pollutants into the ground, air and water;\n\u2022\nthe generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and\n\u2022\nthe investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims with respect to environmental matters, including on-site and off-site treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We have given indemnities to subsequent owners for certain of our former operational sites, and we have separately received indemnification, subject to certain limitations, with respect to one of those sites. We could incur material costs in connection with these matters, including in connection with sites where we do not have indemnifications from third parties, where the indemnitor ceases to pay under its indemnity obligations or where the indemnities otherwise become inapplicable or unavailable.\nEnvironmental and health-related requirements are complex, subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent. Future developments could require us to make additional expenditures to modify or curtail our operations, install pollution control equipment or investigate and clean up contaminated sites. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe discovery of new information concerning past releases of hazardous substances or wastes;\n\u2022\nthe discovery or occurrence of compliance problems relating to our operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in existing environmental laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the enactment of new laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nmore rigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities.\nThese events could cause us to incur various expenditures and could also subject us to fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination or restore natural resources, liability for third party property damage or personal injury claims and the imposition of new permitting requirements and/or the modification or revocation of our existing operating permits, among other effects. These and other developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation. See \u201cBusiness-Environmental regulation\u201d under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nThe catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, civil unrest or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax legislation in local jurisdictions may have an impact on our overall effective tax rate, which, in turn, may harm our profitability.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our pre-tax income or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each of our taxpaying entities or groups of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in these jurisdictions may provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of profits and losses between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate. Further, changes in tax legislation, such as changes in tax rates, transfer pricing regimes and treaty disputes, the applicability of value added taxes and the imposition of new taxes, could have an adverse effect on profitability.\nWe have significant amounts of debt and require significant cash flow to service our debt.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and may issue additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $298.3 million and $295.4 million,\nrespectively, of long-term debt outstanding. Our high levels of indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our stock price;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, which reduces the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our financing documents;\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\ntriggering an event of default under our credit facilities if we fail to comply with the related financial and other restrictive covenants.\nIn order to adequately service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our future cash flow is subject to some factors that are beyond our control, and our future cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as delaying capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be implemented on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, or at all, and may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. Restrictive covenants in our indebtedness may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives (with the failure to comply with these covenants resulting in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness). Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, if accelerated upon an event of default. We may be unable to repay, refinance or restructure the payments of those debt instruments.\nOur debt instruments restrict our current and future operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt, incur liens or issue certain equity;\n\u2022\ndeclare or make distributions to our stockholders over $35.0 million in any fiscal year,\n\u2022\nrepurchase shares of our common stock or prepay certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and certain investments;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions of equity or assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\namend or modify organizational documents; and\n\u2022\nengage in businesses other than the businesses we currently conduct.\nIn addition to the restrictions and covenants listed above, our debt instruments require us to comply with specified financial maintenance covenants. These restrictions or covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet certain capital needs and could otherwise restrict our corporate activities.\nAny one or more of the risks discussed in this section, as well as events not yet contemplated, could result in our failing to meet the covenants and restrictions described above. Events beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions, and an adverse development affecting our business could require us to seek waivers or amendments of these covenants or restrictions or alternative or additional sources of financing. We may be unable to obtain these waivers, amendments or alternatives on favorable terms, if at all.\nA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future debt instruments, including our inability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants in these debt instruments, could result in an event of default under these debt instruments. An event of default could permit the agent or lenders under the debt instruments to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt, as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies, and to institute enforcement proceedings against our assets or collateral that secure the extensions of credit under our outstanding indebtedness. The agent or lenders could terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds. If the agent or lenders require immediate repayments, we may not be able to repay them in full. This could harm our financial results, liquidity, cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and could lead to our bankruptcy.\nSubstantially all of our domestic subsidiaries' assets are pledged as collateral under our credit facilities.\nSubstantially all of our domestic subsidiaries' assets are pledged as collateral for these borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the agent or the lenders, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the assets pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell these assets in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company.\nRemy International, Inc. is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. The payment of funds in the form of dividends, inter-company payments, tax sharing payments and other payments may in some instances be subject to restrictions under the terms of our subsidiaries' financing arrangements.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly.\nA significant portion of our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks. A 1% increase in the current variable rate would have an immaterial impact on our interest expense because the rate on our Term B loan, our primary debt facility, would not rise above the LIBOR floor rate of 1.25% set under our Term B loan agreement. In addition, we have interest rate swaps in place with respect to approximately 49% of the principal amount of our Term B loan with an effective date of December 30, 2016.\nOur ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to fluctuations of our borrowing base and periodic appraisals of certain of our assets. An appraisal could result in the reduction of available borrowings under this facility, which would harm our liquidity.\nThe borrowings available under our revolving credit facility are subject to fluctuations in the calculation of a borrowing base, which is based on the value of our domestic accounts receivable and inventory. The administrative agent for this facility causes a third party to perform an appraisal of the assets included in the calculation of the borrowing base either on a semi-annual basis or more frequently if our availability under the facility is less than $23.75 million during any 12-month period. If certain material defaults under the facility have occurred and are continuing, then the administrative agent has the right to perform this appraisal as often as it deems necessary in its sole discretion. If an appraisal results in a significant reduction of the borrowing base, then a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility could become immediately due and payable.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted new regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which may complicate our supply chain. These regulations require annual reporting and disclosures for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\"DRC\") and adjoining countries in their products. Initial due diligence efforts were required in 2013, and initial disclosure requirements began in May 2014. Complying with these requirements could require us to incur significant expenses, including to ascertain the sources of conflict minerals in our products and to modify our processes and products, if required. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC conflict free components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are\nunable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products. As such, these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials in our products\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe are subject to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management and our independent registered public accounting firm have provided such reports with this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We may identify control deficiencies and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in the past, prior to becoming a public company, and we may identify additional deficiencies or weaknesses again in the future.\nIf we or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, that could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information, cause the trading price of our stock to fall, and we could become subject to investigations by the NASDAQ on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nA disruption in our information technology (\"IT\") systems could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems, some of which are managed or housed by third parties, and our ability to continually update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Future attacks could result in our systems or data being breached and/or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in not only business disruption, but also theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and/or unauthorized access to controlled data and personal information stored in connection with our human resources function. Any interruption, outage or breach of our IT systems could adversely affect our business operations. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships, harm our business and possibly lead to claims, liability, or fines based upon alleged breaches of contract or applicable laws.\nThe spin-off could result in significant tax liability to FNF and to holders of FNFV Group common stock, and under certain circumstances Remy International, Inc. may have a significant indemnity obligation to FNF, which is not limited in amount or subject to any cap, if the spin-off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nThe spin-off is conditioned upon the receipt by FNF and New Remy of the opinion of Deloitte Tax LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d), tax advisor to New Remy, to the effect that the contribution and the spin-off should qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code and a distribution to which Sections 355 and 361 of the Code applies. The opinion will be based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by FNF, New Remy, and our Company. Any inaccuracy in the representations or assumptions upon which such tax opinion is based, or failure by FNF, New Remy, or our Company to comply with any undertakings made in connection with such tax opinion, could alter the conclusions reached in such opinion. Opinions with respect to these matters are not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the courts. As a result, the conclusions expressed in these opinions could be challenged by the IRS and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a) of the Code, the spin-off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to FNF (but not to holders of FNFV Group common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of New Remy (including indirectly through acquisitions of Remy International, Inc. common stock) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. Current law generally creates a presumption\nthat any acquisitions of the stock of New Remy within two years before or after the spin-off are part of a plan that includes the spin-off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. We do not expect that the mergers, by themselves, will cause Section 355(e) to apply to the spin-off. Further, it will be a condition to FNF's obligation to consummate the spin-off that FNF receive an opinion of Deloitte implicitly concluding that the mergers will not cause Section 355(e) to apply to the spin-off. This opinion will be based on certain representations and assumptions, and, as discussed above, will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Further, notwithstanding such opinion, New Remy or Remy International, Inc. might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in the ownership of New Remy or Remy International, Inc. to occur, thereby triggering a tax liability to FNF. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable to FNF, FNF would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of the New Remy common stock held by it immediately before the spin-off over FNF's tax basis therein. Open market purchases of Remy International, Inc. common stock by third parties without any negotiation with Remy International, Inc. will generally not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the spin-off.\nIf it is subsequently determined, for whatever reason, that the spin-off does not qualify for tax-free treatment, holders of FNFV Group common stock immediately prior to the spin-off, FNF could incur significant tax liabilities. Under the tax matters agreement, Remy International, Inc. will be obligated to indemnify FNF and its subsidiaries for any losses and taxes resulting from the failure of the spin-off to be a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a) of the Code to the extent that such failure results from (i) any action by Remy International, Inc. or its subsidiaries within their respective control, or the failure to take any action; or (ii) any event or series of events as a result of which any person or persons would (directly or indirectly) acquire or have the right to acquire from Remy International, Inc. or New Remy and/or one or more direct or indirect holders of outstanding shares of Remy International, Inc. equity interests or New Remy equity interests that would, when combined with any other changes in the ownership of New Remy or Remy International, Inc., cause the spin-off to be a taxable event to FNF as a result of the application of section 355(e) of the Code.\nRemy International, Inc. may decide to forgo certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring significant tax-related liabilities.\nIn the tax matters agreement, Remy International, Inc. will covenant that following the mergers it will not take any action, or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act is inconsistent with the spin-off qualifying for tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a) of the Code. Further, the tax matters agreement will require that Remy International, Inc. generally indemnify FNF and its subsidiaries for any taxes or losses incurred by FNF resulting from an act or inaction on the part of Remy International, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries or resulting from Section 355(e) of the Code applying to the spin-off because of certain acquisitions of equity interests in Remy International, Inc. or New Remy. As a result, Remy International, Inc. might determine to forgo certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous in order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off. Open market purchases of Remy International, Inc. common stock by third parties without any negotiation with Remy International, Inc. will generally not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the spin-off.\nIn particular, Remy International, Inc. might determine to continue to operate certain of its business operations for the foreseeable future even if a liquidation or sale of such business might have otherwise been advantageous. Moreover, in light of the mergers as well as certain other transactions that might be treated as part of a plan that includes the spin-off for Section 355(e) purposes (as discussed above), Remy International, Inc. might determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the mergers.", "PERMNO": 85646, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "REMY"}
