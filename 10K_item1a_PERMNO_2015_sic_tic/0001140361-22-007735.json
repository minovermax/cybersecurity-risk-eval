and\n\u25cf\nthe depression of the market price of our common stock due to sale by existing stockholders, executive officers or directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully generate the expected benefits of strategic transactions;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with compliance with public company regulations; and\n\u25cf\nterrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur near term success is highly dependent on the success of the our DPP platform, and we cannot be certain that we will succeed in developing one or more of those systems or that, if we do, they will attain market acceptance or be successfully commercialized in the United States or elsewhere.\nWe do not currently have an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems or for our DPP Respiratory Panel, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA. We also do not have a CLIA waiver from the FDA for our DPP HIV-Syphilis test system. Market and regulatory requirements continue to change at a rapid pace. The FDA has declined to review our most recent EUAs submitted for our DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System based on then-effective prioritization guidance, which is subject to change. There can be no assurance that, if we make a submission of any future EUA or CLIA waiver application, we will meet the requirements of the prioritization guidance in effect at the time of the submission or otherwise be successful in obtaining either (1) an EUA that would permit us to offer and sell the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system or DPP Respiratory Panel in the United States or (2) a CLIA waiver for our DPP HIV-Syphilis test.\nEven if we are able to obtain any such EUA or CLIA waiver, our product may not gain broad market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients, and the medical community. We cannot guarantee market acceptance of our product, and have somewhat limited information on which to estimate our anticipated level of sales. Our products will require healthcare providers and doctors to accept and adopt our technology. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological developments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological advances. Acceptance and use of any products we market will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nlimitation on use or warnings required by the FDA or other global regulators in our product labeling;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our products relative to competing products;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\npotential advantages of alternative diagnostic and treatment methods;\n\u2022\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our diagnostic solutions to address different variants.\nIn addition, with respect to any EUA we obtain, the FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, even if we obtain an EUA, we cannot predict how long such EUA would remain in place. Such revocation could materially adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including if the relevant product is not yet approved by the FDA under a traditional approval pathway and if we have invested in the supply chain to provide any of our products under an EUA, and would require us to obtain a 510(k) or other marketing authorization from the FDA. If the FDA revokes a previously issued EUA prior to us having received regulatory approval to commercialize our DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system or DPP Respiratory Panel through a traditional approval pathway, we would be required to cease our commercialization efforts, which would substantially and negatively impact our business.\nThe failure of these products to find market acceptance would substantially harm our business and would adversely affect our revenue. If the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system, DPP Respiratory Panel or DPP HIV-Syphilis test are not as successfully commercialized as expected, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. Any failure of one of these products to be successfully commercialized in the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating result financial condition and cash flows, and could result in a substantial decline in the price of our common stock. In addition, the production and widely administered use of efficacious vaccines for COVID-19 may reduce the demand for diagnostic tests and, as a result, the COVID-19 diagnostic testing market may not develop or substantially grow. Our future success is substantially dependent on the manner in which the market for diagnostic testing develops and grows. If the market develops in a manner that does not facilitate demand for our products, or fails to develop or grow in the manner in which we expect or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nClinical trials necessary to support a future test kit submission will be expensive and may require the enrollment of large numbers of subjects, and suitable subjects may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new test kits and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a future EUA, 510(k), PMA, or de novo submission, will be time consuming, expensive, and have an uncertain outcome. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any test kit we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical trials will require the enrollment of large numbers of subjects, and suitable subjects may be difficult to identify and recruit. Subject enrollment in clinical trials and completion of subject participation depends on many factors, including the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the indication of the underlying test kit, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of subjects to clinical sites and able to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and subject compliance. In addition, subjects may not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, subjects may choose not to enroll or continue participating in the clinical trial as a result of the pandemic. As a result, potential subjects in our clinical trials may choose to not enroll, not participate in follow-up clinical visits, or drop out of the trial as a precaution against contracting COVID-19. Further, some subjects may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede subject movement or interrupt healthcare services. We are unable to predict with confidence the duration of any such potential subject enrollment delays and difficulties, whether related to COVID-19 or otherwise. Delays in subject enrollment or failure of subjects to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our test kits or result in the failure of the clinical trial.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of subjects than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate for approval. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have been allocating a substantial portion of our resources to the development and commercialization of DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system, and our long term business success could be negatively impacted by our diversion of resources from our legacy business of diagnostic testing for other infectious diseases.\nIn the first quarter of 2020 we began committing substantially all of our financial and personnel resources to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system. Because we do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system, starting in the first quarter of 2021 we began allocating an increased portion of our resources to our legacy products. Our earlier and continuing resource allocation to the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system may have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our legacy product portfolio, as we have spent limited funds and time on updating pre-existing products and regulatory approvals and on completing products that were in development prior to our strategic decision to focus on the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could dissipate; there is no guarantee that current or anticipated demand will continue, or if demand does continue, that we will be able to produce in quantities to meet the demand. We intend to continue to reestablish our legacy business, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recommence the development and commercialization of our legacy products and products under development.\nThe diagnostic testing market, particularly with respect to COVID-19, is highly competitive, and many of our competitors are larger, better established and have greater technical and marketing capabilities and financial and other resources than we have.\nThe diagnostics market, particularly with respect to COVID-19 diagnostic tests, is highly competitive and we face substantial competition based on factors such as product quality, analytical performance, ease of use, price, manufacturing costs, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is also based the following additional factors:\n\u25cf\npatent protection;\n\u25cf\nscientific expertise;\n\u25cf\nability to develop and market products and processes;\n\u25cf\nability to obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nability to manufacture cost-effective products that meet applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\naccess to adequate capital; and\n\u25cf\nability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nNumerous companies in the United States and internationally have introduced or announced their intention to introduce new products, services and technologies that could be used in substitution for the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system. Many of those competitors are significantly larger, and have substantially greater financial, engineering and other resources, than us. In addition, our competitors may have or may develop products or technologies that currently or in the future will enable them to produce competitive products with greater capabilities or at lower costs than ours. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may fail to meet our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, the production of an efficacious vaccine or other treatment for a disease underlying one of our products may reduce the demand for relevant diagnostic products. The success or failure, or perceived success or failure, of other companies may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding, or to ultimately commercialize the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test system.\nWe face risks related to an ongoing SEC investigation.\nThe SEC is conducting a non-public, fact-finding investigation relating to the May 2020 Offering and to the FDA\u2019s revocation in June 2020 of an EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG system that was issued in April 2020. We received subpoenas from the SEC in July 2020 and April 2021 seeking the production of documents in connection with this investigation. In addition, the SEC delivered subpoenas in April 2021 to five of our employees (including our three executive officers, who consist of our Chief Executive Officer and President, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific and Technology Officer). An additional subpoena was issued in June 2021 to our former Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chair. Each subpoena requested the production of documents relating to the same matters as are the subject of the subpoenas we received.\nWe are unable to predict what the timing or outcome of the SEC investigation will be or what, if any, consequences the SEC investigation may have with respect to our company or the six individuals mentioned above. The SEC investigation could result in considerable legal expenses, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and harm our business. If the SEC were to determine that legal violations occurred, we could be required to pay significant civil penalties or other amounts, and remedies or conditions could be imposed as part of any resolution. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of the SEC investigation.\nStockholder litigation could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of existing and any future stockholder litigation, including four stockholder lawsuits to date that have been brought against us. See \u201cPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d below for additional information regarding existing lawsuits. These lawsuits or other future litigation may adversely affect the ability of our technical and management personnel, and our directors, to perform their normal responsibilities. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors, officers and other employees, as well as to third parties such as underwriters of our public offerings.\nWe expect competition with respect to testing solutions for COVID-19 to continue to increase and our success will depend on market acceptance of our products.\nWe expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, services and technologies are introduced. The entrance of new competitors is being encouraged by governmental authorities, which are offering funding to support development of testing solutions for COVID-19. Some of our existing or new competitors may have strong relationships with current and potential customers, including governmental authorities that may help fund those competing entities through grant awards or other funding. As a result, those competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing regulatory requirements, new or emerging technologies, and changes in customer requirements. We do not currently have, or have an application pending for, an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. Even if we succeed in obtaining approvals for commercialization for one or more of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, those products may not compete favorably, and we may not be successful in the face of existing and new products and technologies offered by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our suppliers and employees, and cause disruptions in current and future plans for operations and expansion.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to directly and indirectly adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The extent to which this will continue will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted with precision or certainty at this time.\nOur business may continue to be disrupted due to the costs incurred as a result of additional necessary actions and preparedness plans to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and continued operations, including enhanced cleaning processes, protocols designed to implement appropriate social distancing practices, and/or adoption of additional wage and benefit programs to assist employees. We may also have difficulty meeting demand for our products if our employees are affected by COVID-19, or if we do not have adequate space to produce our product with social distancing practices implemented. We also cannot predict the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain\u2019s reliability and costs.\nIn addition, our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, including the related response, could cause disruptions due to potential suspension or slowdown of activities at our third-party suppliers, manufacturing delays, or increased prices implemented by our suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain, including the manufacturing or delivery of some of the key supplies used in our tests. Many suppliers are experiencing shortages of required personnel as the result of the tight labor market and underlying raw material commodities. Some suppliers have been unable to deliver supplies in the quantity we need or at all. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and materials, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand, or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. The adverse effect on our employees or suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a fragmented, segmented, and rapidly changing industry, which is highly competitive with respect to numerous factors, and our success depends on our ability compete effectively with larger companies, develop new or enhance existing products, as well as acceptance of DPP over other diagnostic platform technologies.\nImportant competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, and customer service. A few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented.\nMore generally, the point-of-care diagnostics industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. As new technologies become introduced into the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, we may be required to commit considerable additional efforts, time and resources to enhance our current product portfolio or develop new products. We may not have the available time and resources to accomplish this, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which would materially harm our operating results.\nAlthough we own DPP patents, lateral flow technology is still a competitive platform to DPP, and lateral flow technology has a lower cost of manufacture than DPP products. Although the DPP platform has shown improved sensitivity as compared with conventional lateral flow platforms in a number of studies, several factors go into the development and performance attributes of products. Therefore the ability of our products to successfully compete will depend on several other factors, including our having a patented rapid test platform technology that differentiates DPP from lateral flow as well as from other diagnostic platform technologies.\nThere can be no assurance that our DPP patents or our products incorporating those patents will not be challenged at some time in the future.\nOur competitors may develop and commercialize more effective or successful products, and our research, development and commercialization efforts may not succeed.\nWe regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of our new or enhanced products. The research and development process usually takes a long time from inception to commercial launch. During each stage of this process there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals in a timely fashion, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product in which we have invested substantial time and money. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to our research and development activities.\nOur products require significant development and investment prior to commercialization, including testing to demonstrate the products\u2019 performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits. We must obtain regulatory approval before most products may be sold and additional development efforts on these products may be required before the products will be reviewed. However, regulatory authorities may not approve these products for commercial sale or may substantially delay or condition such approval. There may be little or no market for the product and entry into or development of new markets for our products may require an investment of substantial resources even if all applicable regulatory approvals are obtained. Furthermore, we may spend a significant amount of money on advertising or other activities and still fail to develop a market for the product. The success of our efforts may be affected by our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, whether we can obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protection and our ability to obtain reimbursement authorizations in the markets where the product will be sold. Therefore, if we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products, or if competitors develop more effective products or a greater number of successful new products, customers may decide not to purchase our products.\nOur products may not be able to compete with new diagnostic products or existing products developed by well-established competitors, which would negatively affect our business.\nThe diagnostic industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point-of-care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Important competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, and customer service.\nA few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented.\nSome of our principal competitors may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several companies produce diagnostic tests that compete directly with our testing product line, including Abbott (Alere), OraSure Technologies and Trinity Biotech. Some competitors offer broader product lines and may have greater name recognition than we have. These and other companies have or may have products incorporating molecular or other advanced technologies that over time could directly compete with our testing product line. We also face competition from certain of our distributors or former customers that have created or may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours.\nAs new products incorporating new technologies enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor\u2019s products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold. If our competitors\u2019 products take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers internally develop or acquire their own sample collection devices and use those devices in place of our products in order to reduce costs.\nOur future revenues and operating results may be negatively affected by ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry.\nThere has been a significant amount of consolidation in the healthcare industry. This consolidation has increased the competition to provide goods and services to customers. In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Due to ongoing consolidation, there could be additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nWe may not successfully manage the transition associated with the appointment of a new chief financial officer, which could have an adverse impact on us.\nOn October 18, 2021, we announced that Neil A. Goldman had notified the board of directors of his resignation as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On January 6, 2022, we announced that we had appointed Lawrence J. Steenvoorden as our Chief Financial Officer, effective as of January 5, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our new Chief Financial Officer, and our senior leadership team generally, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Management transition is often difficult and inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to execute our business strategies may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with these transitions.\nOur continued growth depends on retaining our current key employees and attracting additional qualified personnel, and we may not be able to do so.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the skills and experience of our executive officers, sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products businesses and academic and other research institutions, as well as to geographic considerations, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and other reasons.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products to meet the demands of our customers and strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support internal research and development programs.\nWe have entered into employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer, Richard Eberly, our Chief Science & Technology Officer, Javan Esfandiari, and our Chief Financial Officer, Lawrence J. Steenvoorden. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market generally and to our company specifically, the loss of the services of any one of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not obtained a key man insurance policy on any officers other than Messrs. Eberly and Esfandiari.\nThird-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints could negatively affect our business.\nThe potential end-users of our products include hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. If these end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients\u2019 healthcare insurers or payors, the use of our products could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the net sales of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors.\nHospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product. Due to the overall escalating cost of medical products and services, especially in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and its straining of healthcare systems across the globe, there is increased pressure on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States, available levels of reimbursement may change for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nTo the extent that we are unable to collect our outstanding accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nThere may be circumstances and timing that require us to accept payment terms, including delayed payment terms, from distributors or customers, which, if not satisfied, could cause financial losses.\nWe generally accept payment terms which require us to ship product before the contract price has been paid fully, and there also are circumstances pursuant to which we may accept further delayed payment terms pursuant to which we may continue to deliver product. To the extent that these circumstances result in significant accounts receivables and those accounts receivables are not paid on a timely basis, or are not paid at all, especially if concentrated in one or two customers, we could suffer financial losses.\nWe believe our success depends in part on the continued funding of, and our ability to participate in, large testing programs in the U.S. and worldwide, the funding of which may be reduced or discontinued or otherwise be unavailable to us.\nWe believe it to be in our best interests to meaningfully participate in large testing programs. Moreover many of these programs are funded by governments and other donors, and there can be no assurance that funding will not be reduced or completely discontinued. Participation in these programs also requires alignment and engagement with the many other participants in these programs, including the World Health Organization, or WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Agency for International Development, foreign governments and their agencies, non-governmental organizations, and HIV service organizations. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to participate in these programs, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nDeveloping testing guidelines could negatively affect sales of our products.\nGovernment agencies may issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can alter the usage of our HIV testing products. New laws or guidelines, or changes to existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied, could impact the degree to which our testing products are used. These developments could affect the frequency of testing, the number of people tested and whether the testing products are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations.\nSome of our programs are supported by government grant awards, and our inability to obtain additional grant awards in the future or to derive all of the funding potentially available under those awards could delay our development and introduction of products.\nWe have received funding under grant award programs funded by governmental agencies such as BARDA. To fund a portion of our future research and development programs, we may apply for additional grant funding from these or similar governmental agencies. Funding by these governmental agencies may, however, be significantly reduced or eliminated in the future for a number of reasons. For example, some programs are subject to a yearly appropriations process in Congress. We may not receive full funding under current or future grants because of budgeting constraints of the agency administering the program or unsatisfactory progress on the study being funded.\nIn addition, some or all of the funding available under grant awards may be conditioned upon our successfully meeting specified milestones or other conditions, and there can be no assurance that those milestones or conditions will be met. For example, in December 2020 we were awarded the Second Grant pursuant to a contract from BARDA that included funding milestones related to our development and pursuit of an EUA for a DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and our submission for 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the DPP SARS CoV 2 Antigen System.\nThere can be no assurance that we will receive any future grant awards from any government agencies or that, if a grant award is obtained, we will receive the full amount potentially available under the grant award. Our inability to obtain future grant awards, or to earn the full amount available under those awards, could delay the development of our product candidates and the introduction of new products.\nWe could be exposed to liability if we experience security breaches or other disruptions, which could harm our reputation and business.\nWe may be subject to cyber-attacks whereby computer hackers may attempt to access our computer systems or our third-party IT service providers\u2019 systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential information. In addition, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures or obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving sensitive information. We will continue to evaluate and implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk and detect cyber incidents, but cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Even though we take cyber-security measures that are continuously reviewed and updated, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable due to sophisticated attacks by hackers or breaches.\nEven the most well protected IT networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in security breaches are continually evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and, in fact, may not be detected. Any such compromise of our or our third party\u2019s IT service providers\u2019 data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information, could result in legal claims proceedings, liability under laws to protect, privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to efficiently operate our business is reliant on information technology, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely heavily on complex information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, invoices, purchase orders, shipping, interactions with our third-party logistics providers, revenue and expense accounting, consumer call support, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products, respond to customer inquiries, and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet.\nIf any of the foregoing systems fails to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations. Significant expenditures could be required to fix any such problem.\nIf there is an increase in demand for our products, it could require us to expend considerable resources or harm our customer relationships if we are unable to meet that demand.\nIf there are significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. This would increase our capital costs, which could negatively affect our earnings and liquidity in the short term. In addition, new manufacturing equipment or facilities may require FDA, WHO, and other regulatory approvals before they can be used to manufacture our products. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we or our suppliers are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner. If we fail to increase production volumes in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production problems as a result of changes that we or our suppliers make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand, we could experience shipment delays or interruptions and increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nIf there are unexpected increases in demand for our products, we may be required to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the increase in demand. However, some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. It is also possible that one or more of our suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits.\nIf we are unable to meet customer demand for our products, it could also harm our relationships with our customers and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nIndustry adoption of alternative technology to our COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully.\nOf the 263 manufacturers and commercial laboratories to receive an EUA for COVID-19 diagnostics as of December 31, 2021, 66 were for serology tests, 200 were for molecular tests, and 14 were for antigen tests. Customers or the industry as a whole could adopt alternative technologies for testing, including molecular point of care testing, which could result in lower demand for our antigen test. Various advances in the treatment and monitoring of patients could cause lower demand for the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, including our revised DPP SARS CoV 2 Antigen System or for antigen testing for COVID-19 as a whole.\nCOVID-19 is prone to genetic mutations that may impact the ability of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems to adequately detect COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies, and could adversely affect demand for the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems and harm our competitive position.\nFalse test results are a risk with all laboratory tests, including COVID-19 diagnostic tests. False results can occur in the presence or absence of a mutation in the COVID-19 virus. Multiple variations of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally and within the United States, including variants of concern initially identified in California, Brazil, South Africa and the United Kingdom. In the presence of a mutation in the virus, false results can occur if a mutation occurs in the region of the virus that the test is designed to assess. False results may occur with the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems in the presence or absence of one or more COVID-19 mutations. If false negatives occur with the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, it will may reduce customer confidence in the accuracy of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems and harm our competitive position.\nFor our business to succeed in the future, our current and future products must receive market acceptance.\nMarket acceptance and the timing of such acceptance, of our new products or technologies is necessary for our future success. To achieve market acceptance, we and our distributors will likely be required to undertake substantial efforts and spend significant funds to inform every one of the existence and perceived benefits of our products. We also may require government funding for the purchase of our products to help create market acceptance and expand the use of our products.\nIt may be difficult evaluate the market reaction to our products and our marketing efforts for new products may not be successful. The government funding we receive may be limited for new products. As such, there can be no assurance that any products will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to effectively introduce and market our products, which could materially harm our operating results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our new products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nNew developments in health treatments and non-diagnostic products may reduce or eliminate the demand for our products.\nThe development and commercialization of products outside of the diagnostics industry could adversely affect sales of our products. For example, the development of a safe and effective vaccine to COVID-19 or HIV or treatments for other diseases or conditions that our products are designed to detect, could reduce or eventually eliminate the demand for our HIV or other diagnostic products and result in a loss of revenues.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to cost-effectively increase manufacturing production capacity through the implementation of additional customized manufacturing automation equipment.\nIf we successfully commercialize the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems or other new products, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality and reducing production costs. Our primary strategy to cost-effectively increase product capacity has been to implement customized automation equipment, and we have entered into agreements to acquire additional customized automation equipment. The equipment we order may not be delivered in a timely manner, and, once delivered, the equipment may require significant time and effort in order to operate in the manner required to produce high quality products. We experienced significant unexpected delays before our current automation equipment operated in the manner for which it was designed. The investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. If we are not successful in introducing COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems or other new products in accordance with our operating plans, we do not have the right to terminate the existing purchase orders for additional automation equipment and we may have excess capacity for a period of time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to timely obtain automation equipment that meets our requirements or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment.\nCustomer concentration creates risks for our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues each year comes from a few large customers. Bio-Manguinhos constituted 51% of our total revenues in 2021 and 25% of our total revenues in 2020. We had another customer that accounted for 10% of our total revenues in 2021, and a third customer that accounted for 12% of our revenue in 2020. To the extent that Bio-Manguinhos or any other large customer fails to meet its purchase commitments, changes its ordering patterns or business strategy, or otherwise reduces its purchases or stops purchasing our products, or if we experience difficulty in meeting the demand by these customers for our products, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSales cycles for our products can be lengthy, which can cause variability and unpredictability in our business.\nSome of our products may require lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Our products may involve sales to large public and private institutions which may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grant awards or other funding from government or public health agencies which can vary from period to period. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue, especially if current negative economic conditions continue or intensify. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives.\nWe may face product liability claims for injuries.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease sales of our products. We cannot be sure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of the policy limits of our existing product liability insurance coverage or that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost, or at all. In addition, a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injury and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur customers may not adopt rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing.\nRapid point-of-care tests are beneficial because, among other things, they can be administered by healthcare providers in their own facilities or used by consumers at home without sending samples to central laboratories. But currently the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. are provided by clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories. In some international markets, such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. However, we expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance or other benefits, physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to obtain diagnostic results through laboratory tests. If we fail to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers, it would have a negative effect on our future sales growth.\nIf our products do not perform properly, it may affect our revenues, stock price and reputation.\nOur products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures may cause the product to report inaccurate information. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming.\nIf our products do not to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be negatively affected. If this occurs, we may be required to implement holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations. Furthermore, the poor performance by one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the price of our common stock.\nFinancial, Economic and Financing Risks\nBecause of our liquidity limitations, we have concluded there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we may require additional capital to fund our operations, which capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs described under \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business\u2500Overview\u201d, \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Substantial Doubt as to Going Concern Status\u201d and \u201c\u2500Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d, management has determined we could not be certain that our plans and initiatives to increase our total revenues and improve our liquidity position would be effectively implemented within one year after the filing date of this report, when the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report, or the Accompanying Financial Statements, are being issued. Without giving effect to the prospect of raising additional capital pursuant to our at-the-market offerings under the ATM Agreement, increasing product revenue in the near future or executing other mitigating plans, many of which are beyond our control, it is unlikely that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our required financial obligations, including our debt service and other obligations due to third parties. The existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve-month period following the filing date of this report, when the Accompanying Financial Statements are being issued.\nOur diagnostic test products require ongoing funding to continue our current development and operational plans, and we have a history of net losses. We intend to continue to expend substantial resources in the short term in connection with the July Purchase Orders (see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\u201d), but we may encounter challenges in fulfilling our obligations, and therefore receiving revenue, under those purchase orders. See \u201c\u2500Because of our liquidity and operational limitations, including the availability of staffing and supply chain resources that are necessary but outside of our control, we will not be able to timely fulfill all of the requirements of the July Purchase Order from Bio-Manguinhos and it is difficult to reliably estimate the extent to which we will be able to timely meet those requirements\u201d below. We will also incur costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, debt service, marketing and selling of our products, and litigation. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding indebtedness of $20.0 million under the Credit Agreement. We may face further liquidity challenges if we are unable to meet obligations set forth in the Credit Agreement, including a financial covenant requiring that we achieve specified minimum total revenue amounts measured as of the end of each quarter. A breach of the minimum total revenue covenant or any other covenant in the Credit Agreement would result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which could enable the Lender to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that, in such an event, we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts due under the Credit Agreement. See \u201c\u2500The failure to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement could result in a default under its terms and, if uncured, could result in action against our pledged assets and dilution of our stockholders\u201d below.\nAs a result, we may need to raise capital in one or more debt or equity offerings to fund our operations and obligations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our company. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our deliveries under our outstanding customer purchase orders or the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. A decline in the market price of our common stock, whether or not coupled with the suspension of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate, or at all.\nContinuing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock, and it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing. Any uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern may also adversely affect our relationships with current and future employees, suppliers, vendors, customers, grantors, creditors, regulators and investors, who may become concerned about our ability to meet our ongoing financial obligations. There is risk that, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties lose confidence in our ability to continue to operate in the ordinary course, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nit may become more difficult for us to attract, retain or replace employees;\n\u2022\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties;\n\u2022\nwe could lose some or a significant portion of our liquidity, either due to stricter credit terms from vendors, or, in the event we undertake a Chapter 11 proceeding and conclude that we need to procure debtor-in-possession financing, an inability to obtain any needed debtor-in-possession financing or to provide adequate protection to certain secured lenders to permit us to access some or all of our cash; and\n\u2022\nour vendors and service providers could seek to renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationships with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe Accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date of this report. As such, the Accompanying Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nBecause of our liquidity and operational limitations, including the availability of staffing and supply chain resources that are necessary but outside of our control, we may not be able to timely fulfill all of the requirements of the July Purchase Order from Bio-Manguinhos and it is difficult to reliably estimate the extent to which we will be able to timely meet those requirements.\nIn July 2021 we received the July Purchase Orders, which we had been pursuing for an extended period of time. See \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition below. Our delivery of the full number of tests covered by each of the July Purchase Orders may be affected by limitations of our supply chain, staffing and liquidity, including matters that are outside our control. We have established internal plans designed to maximize the number of tests we can deliver timely, or at all, pursuant to the July Purchase Orders, and we expect to continue to revise those plans as we obtain new information. The number of uncertainties related to third parties - including the availability of required personnel, raw materials and other resources - currently preclude us, however, from reliably estimating the extent to which we will be able to fulfill the July Purchase Orders on time and at an acceptable cost, or at all. Our ability to generate revenue from the July Purchase Orders, and the margins we can realize from that revenue, will depend on the availability and cost of human, material and other resources required to build and deliver tests in accordance with the July Purchase Orders.\nIn anticipation of receipt of significant purchase orders in 2021, during the first half of 2021 we continued to invest in automating our test manufacturing processes, all of which are now based in the United States, by, among other actions, validating and implementing automated lines to expand our manufacturing capabilities. We did not know, however, the number or mix of tests for which purchase orders might be received, and we now need to configure our automated manufacturing lines for the most efficient use feasible, subject to numerous staffing and other constraints, in producing DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen tests and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assays contemplated by the July Purchase Orders. The number of tests to be delivered pursuant to the July Purchase Orders significantly exceeds the capacity of our automated manufacturing lines. We have neither the time nor the resources to increase our automated manufacturing capacity meaningfully during the delivery periods contemplated by the July Purchase Orders.\nWe therefore are relying upon manual assembly processes to produce a significant portion of the tests deliverable under the July Purchase Orders and other customer orders, which require that we successfully recruit, hire and train a significant number of personnel for employment at our Long Island, New York facilities. Identifying, hiring and retaining assembly line, formulations, production, warehouse, quality control and other personnel for our Long Island facilities at acceptable compensation levels has been challenging in the past, and those circumstances have been exacerbated by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may discourage potential employees from returning to a physical worksite at compensation levels that are acceptable to us, or at all. Upon receiving the July Purchase Orders, we launched a broad campaign to recruit and retain manufacturing and other personnel and, more recently, we temporarily increased pay for manufacturing personnel. Our recruiting efforts have not, however, proven sufficient to overcome the tight labor market that has been impacting many U.S. companies, including employers on Long Island, and we have not been able to hire the number of manufacturing personnel required to meet our internal plans for delivery of all of the tests contemplated by the July Purchase Orders. Our continued inability to identify and hire sufficient numbers of manufacturing personnel, and to manage turnover of currently existing and newly hired personnel, would continue to materially limit our ability to deliver tests under the July Purchase Orders.\nOur delivery of tests covered by the July Purchase Orders has also been negatively affected by limitations on raw materials, components and other supplies. We must obtain additional supplies in order to manufacture tests to meet the requirements of the July Purchase Orders. Some supplies require significant ordering lead time, and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. With some of these suppliers, we do not have long term agreements and instead purchase materials, components and other supplies through a purchase order process. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain, including the manufacturing or delivery of some of the key supplies used in our tests. Many suppliers are experiencing shortages of required personnel as the result of the tight labor market and underlying raw material commodities. Some suppliers have been unable to deliver supplies in the quantity we need or at all. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and materials, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand, or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. Because of the foregoing limitations, as exacerbated by the quantities and timing of supplies required to timely fulfill the July Purchase Orders, we have been required to seek to identify new sources of supplies to replace or augment our past sources, which has proven difficult to do in a reasonable time period and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Moreover, scarcity has caused increases in the cost of some supplies. Our inability to timely obtain required supplies has had an adverse effect on our ability to timely fulfill the July Purchase Orders as well as on our total revenues, cost of sales, related margin and cash flow.\nWe have incurred losses in recent years and we are uncertain about our future profitability and cash flow.\nWe incurred an operating loss every year from 2014 through 2021. Under our operating plans, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in our production capacity, including in expanding facilities and automating manufacturing, and in our sales and marketing, regulatory approval, and research and development activities. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate cash flow in the future will depend on our ability to increase sales of our existing products and to successfully introduce new and enhanced products into the marketplace, all while controlling and managing our expenses consistent with our operating plan.\nBecause we do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, we have been unable to increase our revenues in accordance with our operating plan. As a result, our operating results have not met our expectations. If we experience a continuing delay in obtaining, or are unable to obtain, an EUA for one or more of our COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, our operating results will be further harmed and we may not be able to generate the cash flow needed to fund the investments in our production capacity and other activities. In such an event, we will be required to implement one or both of the following:\n\u2022\nWe could reduce the level, or otherwise delay the timing, of the anticipated investments in our production capacity and other activities, which would likely curtail or delay the growth in our business contemplated by our operating plan and could impair or defer our ability to achieve profitability and generate cash flow. Moreover, if we were to further reduce the number of our personnel, there can be no assurance that we would be able, when desirable, to successfully rehire or rebuild our workforce.\n\u2022\nWe could raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements, to the extent funding would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, the holders of these new securities or debt may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nIn such circumstances, we also would need to forego acquisition opportunities, which could impede our ability to grow our business.\nOur financial results may fluctuate.\nFrom quarter to quarter and year to year, our operating results can fluctuate, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Sales to our distributors and other customers may not meet expectations because of lower than expected customer demand or other factors, including continued economic volatility and disruption, reduced governmental funding, and other circumstances described elsewhere in this report. A variety of factors could also contribute to the variability of our financial results, including infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs.\nDifferent products provide dissimilar contributions to our gross product margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be negatively affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross product margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our common stock.\nThe failure to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement could result in a default under its terms and, if uncured, could result in action against our pledged assets and dilution of our stockholders.\nOn September 3, 2019, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Credit Agreement, under which we received a $20,000,000 senior secured term loan credit facility that was drawn in full on September 4, 2019. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all of our property and assets, including our equity interests in our subsidiaries. See \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2500Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2500Sources of Funds\u2500Credit Agreement.\u201d\nThe Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants requiring that we (a) maintain aggregate unrestricted cash of not less than $3,000,000 at all times, which must be held in one or more accounts subject to the first priority perfected security interests of the Lender under the Credit Agreement, and (b) achieve specified minimum total revenue requirements for the twelve months preceding each quarter end. The minimum total revenue amounts over the next year increase from $42.0 million for the twelve months ending March 31, 2022 to $47.4 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 (see note 13 to the Accompanying Financial Statements). These minimum revenue requirements were developed for purposes of the Credit Agreement and do not reflect the internal estimates and plans used by our management and board of directors to establish operational goals for managing our business. The minimum revenue requirements for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 do not, for example, take into account the challenges we are facing in ramping up production, including hiring personnel and obtaining commitments from our supply chain as described above in \u201c\u2500Because of our liquidity and operational limitations, including the availability of staffing and supply chain resources that are necessary but outside of our control, we will not be able to timely fulfill all of the requirements of the July Purchase Orders and it is difficult to reliably estimate the extent to which we will be able to timely meet those requirements.\u201d\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Credit Agreement restricts the ability of our company and the restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement);\n\u2022\nrepurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake other restricted payments, including paying dividends and making investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or consolidations; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nA breach of the minimum total revenue covenant or any other covenant in the Credit Agreement would result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In such an event, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to fund payment of the amounts that would be due under the Credit Agreement or that, if such liquidity were not available, we would be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, or in completing any other endeavor to continue to be financially viable and continue as a going concern. Our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the near future, whether for purposes of funding payments required under the Credit Agreement or providing additional liquidity needed for our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, to fund planned capital expenditures, and to maintain sufficient working capital depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our operations used $30.9 million in cash in 2021 and $18.9 million in 2020. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt, we may need to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before the maturity thereof, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that, if needed, we would be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that the terms of that debt will allow any of the above alternative measures or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing when needed.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code. The limitations apply if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in the ownership of our equity by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period). Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit the use of our state net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe experienced an ownership change in 2004 and 2006, and we estimate a portion of our existing federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. Since our ownership change in 2006, we have not assessed whether an ownership change has subsequently occurred. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our ownership change in 2006, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating losses and other tax attributes generated before such additional ownership change to offset post-change taxable income. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, the limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. As a result, if or when we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nThe LIBOR calculation method may change, and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021, which may adversely affect our interest expenses under the Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (a) the greater of the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and 2.5% plus (b) 8.75%. At any time at which an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the interest rate will increase by 4.0%. Accrued interest is payable on a monthly basis. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, or IBA, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extended the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.\nIn response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, to identify alternatives to LIBOR. The ARRC has recommended benchmark replacement procedures to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation. The initial steps in the ARRC\u2019s recommended provision reference variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, if LIBOR becomes unavailable in the future an alternative benchmark rate will apply. To the extent our interest rates increase as a result, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nevertheless, sales of our products are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. The fluctuations in the exchange rate could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions.\nThe revenues and expenses of our Malaysian, German and Brazilian subsidiaries are recorded in Malaysian Ringgit, in Euros and Brazilian Real, respectively. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results, and, consequently, our operating results reflect exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, which could increase in the future.\nOur foreign subsidiaries\u2019 revenues and expenses and the translation of their financial results into U.S. dollars may be negatively affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Favorable movement in exchange rates have benefited us in prior periods. However, where there are unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, our consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected. Furthermore, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect year-to-year comparability of operating results. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe operate in countries where there is or may be widespread corruption.\nWe have a policy in place prohibiting our employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors outside the United States, we do not have control over the day to day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor funded markets in Africa where we sell our products, there is significant oversight from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product that includes extensive evaluations of product performance, as well as price and delivery. In Brazil, where we have had numerous product collaborations with FIOCRUZ, the programs through which our products may be deployed are all funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Although FIOCRUZ is affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which is FIOCRUZ\u2019s sole customer, FIOCRUZ is not the exclusive supplier for the Ministry of Health. However, because each of our previous collaborations with FIOCRUZ incorporates a technology transfer aspect, we believe we have a competitive advantage versus other suppliers to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, assuming other aspects of our product offering through FIOCRUZ are otherwise competitive in comparison. We have no knowledge or reason to know of any activities by our employees, distributors or sales agents of any actions which could be in violation of the FCPA, although there can be no assurance of this. In addition, corruption is a problematic factor in doing business in Brazil, and, to the extent bribery and similar practices continue to exist in Brazil, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in gaining business in Brazil, particularly when competing with non U.S. companies.\nOur subsidiary Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. is located in Malaysia. There have been numerous high-profile corruption cases, and corruption is one of the most problematic factors for doing business in Malaysia. While the Malaysian government has acknowledged the problem, it appears that endemic corruption is continuing and that market-based principles are not applied in cases involving individuals with high-level political access. To the extent bribery and similar practices continue to exist in Malaysia, U.S. companies such as ours, which are subject to U.S. laws making it illegal to pay bribes to foreign officials, may make us less competitive in winning business in Malaysia when competing with non-U.S. companies.\nWe base our estimates or judgments relating to critical accounting policies on assumptions that can change or prove to be incorrect.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on such statements. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related: to (1) revenue recognition, including uncertainties related to variable consideration, milestones and bill and hold arrangements; (2) stock based compensation; (3) allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable; (4) inventory reserves and obsolescence; (5) customer sales returns and allowances; (6) contingencies; (7) income taxes; (8) goodwill and intangibles; (8) business acquisition; and (10) research and development costs.\nOur estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, as set forth in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions. If our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the price of our common Stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights, and we cannot be sure that these laws or agreements will adequately protect our rights.\nOur industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies, both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenues and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business.\nAs appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatuses relating to the use or manufacture of those products. However, there have been changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may impact our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nWe believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, strategic relationships, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and name recognition are essential to our success. All our management personnel are bound by non-disclosure agreements. If personnel leave our employment, in some cases we would be required to protect our intellectual property rights pursuant to common law theories which may be less protective than provisions of employment, non-competition or non-disclosure agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary products under trade secret and copyright laws, enter into license agreements for various materials and methods employed in our products, and enter into strategic relationships for distribution of the products. These strategies afford only limited protection. We currently have some foreign patents issued, and we are seeking additional patent protection in several other foreign jurisdictions for our DPP and optical technology. We have licenses to reagents (antigens and peptides) used in several of our products and products under development. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary assets, and respect the intellectual property rights of others, we participate in several markets where intellectual property rights protections are of little or no value. This can place our products and our company at a competitive disadvantage.\nMoreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining these licenses, which may not be available, may require the payment of up-front fees and royalties. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded.\nAny future intellectual property disputes could require significant resource and limit or eliminate our ability to sell products or use certain technologies.\nWe may be required to expend substantial resources in asserting or protecting our intellectual property rights, or in defending suits related to intellectual property rights. We may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. Such litigation is prevalent and is expected to continue. In our business, there are a large number of patents and patent applications similar to our products, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product areas. We, our customers or our suppliers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable.\nThere are a large number of patents in our industry, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. Therefore there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another party\u2019s proprietary rights.\nIf we are involved in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, it could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, market share and business because (1) it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources; (2) its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products; (3) the pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; (4) a court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products; and (5) an adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings.\nUnder certain contracts with third parties, we may indemnify the other party if our products or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Furthermore, our products may contain technology provided to us by third parties, and we may be unable to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us.\nThere may also be other types of disputes that we become involved in regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reissue, patent reexamination, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. These proceedings permit certain persons to challenge the validity of a patent on the grounds that it was known from the prior art. The filing of such proceedings, or the issuance of an adverse decision in such proceedings, could result in the loss of valuable patent rights that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nOur use of third-party suppliers, some of which may constitute our sole supply source, for certain important product components and materials presents risks that could have negative consequences for our business.\nWe purchase certain HIV antigens, a syphilis antigen, COVID-19 antibodies and antigens, the nitrocellulose, and certain other critical components used in our STAT PAK, STAT VIEW, SURE CHECK and DPP product lines from a sole or limited number of sources. If for any reason these suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply our antigen, nitrocellulose, or other critical component needs, we believe that alternative supplies could be obtained at a competitive cost. However, a change in any of the antibodies, antigens, nitrocellulose or other critical components used in our products would require additional development work and clinical trials, as well as approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. In addition, it may be difficult to find such an alternate supply source in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, the termination or limitation of our relationship with one or more of these suppliers could require significant time to complete, increase our costs, and disrupt or discontinue our ability to manufacture and sell the affected products. In addition, governmental purchasers or funding programs in a particular country may require that we purchase key components from suppliers in that country, which could significantly limit our ability to obtain the components with the quality, and at the price, we seek.\nWith some of these suppliers, we do not have long-term agreements and instead purchase components and materials through a purchase order process. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and materials, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand, or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could also result in delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing and quality, and our inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner.\nMoreover, some of these suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could prevent them from supplying us with components or subassemblies used in the design and manufacture of our products. In addition, these suppliers may experience manufacturing delays or shut downs due to circumstances beyond their control, such as complications related to COVID-19, labor issues, political unrest or natural disasters.\nAny supply chain deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations. The availability of critical components and materials from sole- or limited source suppliers could reduce our control over pricing, quality and timely delivery, increase our costs, could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell, and preclude us from manufacturing and selling, certain of our products into one or more markets. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and business.\nOur ability to grow our business will be limited if we fail to maintain existing distribution channels or develop new distribution channels.\nWe collaborate with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors in order to sell our products. The sale of our products depends in large part on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate and work with.\nRelying on distributors or third parties to market and sell our products could negatively impact our business for various reasons, including: (1) we may not be able to find suitable distributors for our products on satisfactory terms, or at all; (2) agreements with distributors may prematurely terminate or may result in litigation between the parties; (3) our distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect; (4) our distributors may prioritize their own private label products that compete with our products; (5) our existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and (6) we may not be able to negotiate new or renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and make every effort to require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, but there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to do so, our business will be negatively impacted.\nOur U.S. government contracts require compliance with numerous laws and increase our risk and liability.\nWe are currently receiving funding from the U.S. government related to the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System, the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and DPP Zika, and our growth strategy may target sales to U.S. government entities. As a result of our U.S. government funding and potential product sales to the U.S. government, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. U.S. government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on government contracts. As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to increased risks of investigation, criminal prosecution and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not. The results of any such actions could adversely impact our business and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial performance.\nA violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts, as well as suspension or debarment. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to the facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire enterprise in certain severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with the U.S. government and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow rules relating to billing on cost-plus contracts, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims, among other potential violations. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected if allegations of impropriety related to such contracts are made against us.\nOur U.S. government contracts are subject to future funding and the government\u2019s choice to exercise options, and may be terminated at the government\u2019s convenience.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are subject to future funding and are subject to the right of the government to terminate the contracts in whole or in part for its convenience. There is pressure for the U.S. government to reduce spending. The non-appropriation of funds or the termination for the government\u2019s convenience of our contracts could negatively affect our financial results. If levels of U.S. government expenditures and authorizations for emerging diseases decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not offer products or are not developing product candidates, or if the U.S. government otherwise declines to exercise its options under its contracts with us, our business, revenues and other operating results would suffer.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nCOVID-19 diagnostic tests, including the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, are subject to changes in CLIA, FDA, ANVISA and other regulatory requirements.\nOur COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems are subject to regulations of the FDA and other regulatory requirements, including ANVISA, Brazil\u2019s health regulatory agency. The regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems may be unclear and are subject to recurring change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, necessitate additional procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also have the ability to impose new or additional requirements relating to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in a substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to sell our products.\nOn February 4, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a declaration that the threat to public health posed by COVID-19 justify the emergency use of unapproved in vitro diagnostics for the detection or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Under Section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued this declaration, the Commissioner of the FDA is authorized to issue EUAs to permit certain developers of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to begin offering the tests for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 without having completed the normally applicable FDA review and clearance or approval process for marketing authorization. We received an EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System on April 14, 2020, which was subsequent revoked by the FDA on June 16, 2020. Such revocation precludes the sale of DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG Systems in the United States unless and until a further regulatory approval or authorization is obtained. We have not received a subsequent EUA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA. Moreover, market and regulatory requirements continue to change at a rapid pace. The FDA has announced, for example, that it intends to update its EUA templates with additional considerations related to the impact of genetic variants on test performance as the FDA learns more about the COVID-19 disease and its knowledge in this area progresses. The time required to obtain marketing authorizations and other approvals from regulatory authorities is unpredictable. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when evaluating clinical trial data can change, and do often change, during development, which makes it difficult to predict with any certainty how they will be applied. If we make future submissions to the FDA, we may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, including future legislation or administrative action, or changes in FDA policy during the period of FDA regulatory review. There can be no assurance that if we are to make a submission of any future EUA application, we will be successful in obtaining an EUA that would permit us to offer and sell any COVID-19 Diagnostic Test System in the United States.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the export of certain products and technologies. We must export our products in compliance with export controls in the United States, including the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. We may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses, and our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or limitations on our ability to export or sell our products imposed by these laws may harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue. Noncompliance with these laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nIf the U.S. government imposes restrictions on the export of COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, or any of our other products, such restrictions could have a material impact on our ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers outside of the United States and harm our ability to compete internationally. Any change in export regulations or legislation, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by export regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products outside the United States or to existing or potential customers with international operations. Changes in our ability to sell our products outside the United States could negatively impact our business prospects and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause we may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of our products, we may not generate revenues in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business. Our existing products as well as our manufacturing facility must meet quality standards and are subject to inspection by a number of domestic regulatory and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. As an example, the time required to obtain an EUA from the FDA for COVID-19 tests has lengthened markedly over the past months due to, among other things, application volume. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges or developments in government regulations, policies or interpretations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. For example, on June 16, 2020, the FDA revoked the EUA it had granted for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System based in part on performance criteria identified after the EUA was granted on April 14, 2020. We do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA. Moreover, FDA regulations, policies and procedures with respect to COVID-19 tests may be significantly impacted by the availability of vaccines for COVID-19 and changes in the FDA\u2019s prioritization guidance. Similarly, the regulatory pathway to 510(k) clearance by the FDA for COVID-19 tests is unclear in light of limited FDA feedback resulting in part from the FDA\u2019s constrained resources.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business. We are, for example, expending resources to modify the design of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test System to achieve performance targets consistent with the FDA\u2019s performance criteria issued subsequent to the granting of our original EUA.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as by non-governmental organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and WHO. We have implemented a quality control system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with the FDA\u2019s quality system requirements, or QSRs, and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets. We also may be subject to import regulations in connection with international sourcing of components and materials incorporated in the manufacturing of our products.\nIf we do not comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements, we may be required to suspend production or sale of our products or institute a recall, which could result in higher costs and a loss of revenues.\nRegulations of the FDA and other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies have significant effects on many aspects of our operations and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including packaging, labeling, manufacturing, adverse event reporting, recalls, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies to determine compliance with FDA regulatory requirements, including QSRs, in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including ISO standards. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA requirements and ISO standards, but the regulations may be unclear and are subject to change, and we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulators will agree with our compliance with these requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved or cleared products or impose conditions on any product clearances or approvals that could restrict the distribution or commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors\u2019 advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or additional regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nOur inability to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDA can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, recall or seizure of products, civil penalties, withdrawal of product registrations, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance for devices, a determination that a device is not approvable, marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. For example, in February 2020, we received a \u201cnot approvable\u201d letter from the FDA with respect to our premarket approval submission on our DPP HIV Syphilis multiplex test for commercial use in the United States, in June 2020 we received notice from the FDA that the EUA for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System had been revoked, and in January 2021 we received notice from the FDA that it was declining to review the DPP SARS CoV 2 Antigen System based on its updated prioritization guidance, under which review of the system was not a priority. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations.\nWe must frequently make judgment decisions with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with how we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. Our reputation could be substantially impaired if we are assessed any civil and criminal penalties and limit our ability to manufacture and market our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to respond to changes in regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our existing products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, ISO requirements, and other applicable regulatory requirements, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and QSR, ISO and other requirements may be unclear and are subject to change. Newly promulgated regulations could require changes to our products, necessitate additional clinical trials or procedures, or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also have the ability to change the requirements for obtaining product approval and/or impose new or additional requirements as part of the approval process. These changes or new or additional requirements may occur after the completion of substantial clinical work and other costly development activities. The implementation of such changes or new or additional requirements may result in additional clinical trials and substantial additional costs and could delay or make it more difficult or complicated to obtain approvals and sell our products. In addition, the FDA may revoke an Emergency Use Authorization under which our products are sold, where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization. Such revocation would preclude the sale of our affected products unless and until a further regulatory approval or authorization is obtained. For example, For example, on June 16, 2020, the FDA revoked the EUA it had granted for the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System based in part on performance criteria identified after the Emergency Use Authorization was granted on April 14, 2020, and since that time we expended resources to design the new COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, including the DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel. We do not currently have an EUA from the FDA for any of the COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Systems, and we do not currently have an application pending for any such EUA We cannot anticipate or predict the effect, if any, that these types of changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDemand for our products may be affected by FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests.\nRegulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories is covered by the FDA, including our Micro Reader analyzer. The FDA has previously taken the position that it has regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, but has exercised enforcement discretion by not regulating most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA certified laboratories. LDTs are tests designed, developed, and performed in house by a laboratory. These laboratories are subject to CLIA regulation but such laboratories have previously not been subject to regulation by the FDA under the agency\u2019s medical device requirements.\nThe FDA announced that it would begin regulating LDTs, and in October 2014 the FDA issued proposed guidance on the regulation of LDTs for public comment. In November 2016, however, the FDA announced it would not finalize the proposed guidance prior to the end of the Obama administration. In January 2017 the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining a possible approach to regulation of LDTs. The discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents. We cannot predict what policies the Biden administration will adopt with respect to LDTs. If the FDA increases regulation of LDTs, it could make it more difficult for laboratories and other customers to continue offering LDTs that involve molecular testing. This, in turn, could reduce demand for our products and adversely impact our revenues.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared, approved, authorized, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and other government agencies to review and clear, approve, or authorize new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the agencies\u2019 ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the agencies\u2019 ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at these agencies have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for medical devices or modifications to be cleared or approved, medical devices to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on January 29, 2021, the FDA announced its intention to resume inspections of manufacturing facilities and products, that would be deemed \u201cmission-critical.\u201d The FDA\u2019s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the products have received breakthrough therapy designation or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation, or are products used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition for which there is no other appropriate substitute. Both for-cause and pre-approval inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to FDA requirements, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and foreign government regulations, compliance with which could increase our costs and affect our operations.\nIn addition to the FDA regulations previously described, other federal, state and foreign laws and regulations may restrict our ability to sell products in those jurisdictions.\nWe must comply with numerous laws related to safe working conditions, environmental protection, disposal of hazardous substances, fire hazard control, manufacturing practices and labor or employment practices. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Due to the number of laws and regulations governing our industry, and the actions of a number of government agencies that could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these laws and regulations. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOngoing changes in healthcare regulation could negatively affect our revenues, business and financial condition.\nThere have been several proposed changes in the United States at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms regarding the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services. These proposals have ranged from fundamentally changing federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care or the Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010.\nHealthcare reform initiatives will continue to be proposed, and may reduce healthcare related funding in an effort. It is impossible to predict the ultimate content and timing of any healthcare reform legislation and its resulting impact on us. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise negatively effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe EU landscape concerning medical devices recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation entered into force, which repeals and replaces the Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or E.U. Medical Devices Directive, and Directive 90/385/EEC, or AIMDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of E.U. member state laws implementing them) in all E.U. member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among E.U. member states. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive or the AIMDD prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements.\nSubject to the transitional provisions, in order to sell our products in E.U. member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces EU Medical Devices Directive and the AIMDD. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the E.U. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the E.U.\nWe must inform the notified body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices that we market or sell in the E.U. and the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or substantial changes to our medical devices that could affect compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation or cause a substantial change to the intended use for which the device has been CE marked. The notified body will then assess the planned changes and verify whether they affect the products\u2019 ongoing conformity with the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation.\nWe may incur additional costs if we do not comply with privacy, security and breach notification regulations.\nWe believe that we are not a covered entity nor a business associate of a covered entity and are not responsible for complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Even though we likely are not a covered entity under HIPAA, we do have in place administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information. We are required to comply with varying state privacy, security and breach reporting laws. If we fail to comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to properly transferring data containing consumers\u2019 personal information, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. Also, there are other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information, and we may be subject to enforcement by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. We could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information.\nFailure to comply with European and U.K. data protection requirements could increase our costs.\nThe E.U. adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the prior national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The E.U. data protection regime extends the scope of the E.U. data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of E.U. residents. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the E.U. without a need for local implementing legislation, as had been the case under the prior data protection regime, local data protection authorities have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We have evaluated these new requirements and have implemented a plan to ensure compliance. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, we have no assurances that violations will not occur, particularly given the complexity of the GDPR, as well as the uncertainties that accompany new, comprehensive legislation. Further, from January 1, 2021, we have to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which may expose us to further compliance risk. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/ extends that decision.\nIf we are not able to manufacture products in accordance with applicable requirements, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers.\nIf we are not able to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere are various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry to which we are subject, including anti-kickback laws, laws constraining the sales, false claims laws, marketing and promotion of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that manufacturers of these products may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. There are other laws we are subject to that require us to report certain transactions between it and healthcare professionals. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Many of the existing requirements are new and have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, all of which could materially harm us. Furthermore, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we expand our international presence, it may increase our risks and expose our business to regulatory, cultural or other challenges.\nThere are several of factors that could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including: (1) uncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties; (2) cultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products; (3) exchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives; (4) trade protection measures, trade sanctions and import/export licensing requirements; (5) our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or registrations for our products; (6) economic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries; (7) reduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries; (8) our inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements; and (9) restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations.\nEconomic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Common Stock\nOur common stock may have limited liquidity, and investors may not be able to sell as much common stock as they want at prevailing market prices or at all.\nThe liquidity of our common stock depends on several factors, including our financial results and overall market conditions, so it is not possible to predict whether this level of liquidity will continue, be sustained, or decrease. Decreased trading volume in our stock would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Our management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over our company.\nDecreased trading volume in our stock would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Although there is no affiliation between our management and our larger stockholders, they could exercise significant control over our company if they voted their shares in a similar manner.\nThe price of our common stock could continue to be volatile, and existing stockholders\u2019 investments in our common stock could lose value.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile, subject to rapid and substantial decreases in stock price, and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, our common stock has traded at a low of $1.09 and a high of $7.97. As a result of this volatility, investors could experience losses on their investment in our common stock.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including, but not limited to: our cash flows and cash position; the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; our quarterly or annual operating results; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in our business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections; changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and announcements of legislative or regulatory change.\nOverall, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many other similar companies. Such price fluctuations are generally unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nSince the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are currently subject to securities class-action litigation as described in \u201c-Legal Matters-Legal Proceedings\u201d above. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current levels.\nSecurities of certain companies have recently experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d Short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Sharp rises in a company\u2019s stock price may force traders in a short position to buy the stock to avoid even greater losses. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. There can be no assurance that we will not, in the future be, a target of a short squeeze, and stockholders may lose a significant portion or all of their investments if they purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nOur stock price may in the future not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), which we refer to as the Minimum Bid Price Rule, provides that the closing bid price for our common stock may not be below $1.00 per share for any period of 30 consecutive trading days to maintain our continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. As of March 1, 2022, the closing bid price for our common stock was $0.97. Although we are currently in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to satisfy this rule. If we were to fail to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule in the future and became subject to delisting, such delisting from Nasdaq would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur common stock may become the target of a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\nSecurities of certain companies have increasingly experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d Short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Sharp rises in a company\u2019s stock price may force traders in a short position to buy the stock to avoid even greater losses. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. There can be no assurance that we will not, in the future be, a target of a short squeeze, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings, exercises of outstanding options and vesting of options and restricted and performance stock units.\nOn July 19, 2021, we entered into the ATM Agreement, pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $60,000,000 of shares of common stock through Craig-Hallum, as sales agent. As of the filing date of this report, we have issued and sold pursuant to the ATM Agreement a total of 9,709,328 shares of common stock at a volume-weighted average price of $4.2011 per share for gross proceeds of $40.8 million and net proceeds, after giving effect to placement fees and other transaction costs, of $38.8 million. For additional information about the at-the-market offerings pursuant to the ATM Agreement, see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may seek to offer pursuant to the ATM Agreement additional shares of common stock for up to $19.2 million in gross proceeds and we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell additional shares in at-the-market offerings made pursuant to the ATM Agreement, or in any other offering, at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by existing stockholders. Investors purchasing securities in other offerings in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nAs of the close of business on March 1, 2022, our market capitalization was approximately $29.2 million. Existing stockholders may experience significant dilution in connection with our issuance and sale of up to $21.2 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, 3,386,393 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, 1,600,372 shares were subject to outstanding options, and 705,325 shares were subject to outstanding restricted and performance stock units. Stockholders will incur dilution upon vesting of restricted and performance stock units, and they may incur dilution upon exercises of stock options.\nManagement will have broad discretion as to the use of any net proceeds of the offering made pursuant to the ATM Agreement, and we may not use those net proceeds effectively.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering made pursuant to the ATM Agreement and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAny future issuances of shares of our common stock by us could harm the price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.\nAny future sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock or other equity-related securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities.\nSales of our common stock by existing stockholders, executive officers or directors could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf our existing stockholders, officers or directors sell our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, it could negatively affect the price of our common stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our common stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our common stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.\nInstitutional stockholders own significant amounts of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, the prevailing price of our common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers or non-employee members of our Board of Directors could sell shares of our common stock during an open trading window. These transactions and the perceived reasons for these transactions could have a negative effect on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock and currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Therefore, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future increase in value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will gain value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not generate the expected benefits of future strategic transactions or investments, and they could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management, increase our expenses and negatively affect our business.\nAs a way for us to grow our business, we may pursue strategic transactions or investments. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following: (1) the benefits expected to be derived from a transaction or investment may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, our inexperience with new businesses or markets, general economic conditions and increased competition; (2) we may be unable to successfully integrate with a partner company\u2019s personnel, assets, management, information technology systems, accounting policies and practices, products and/or technology into our business; (3) we may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of a partner business; and (4) a strategic transaction may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, stockholder lawsuits, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the partner business.\nIf these factors occur, we may be unable to achieve all or a significant part of the benefits expected from a strategic transaction or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\nOur compliance with regulations governing public companies is complex and expensive.\nPublic companies are subject to various laws and regulations, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. For example, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The implementation of certain aspects of these laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and may require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. We continually review changes with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs, and the timing of such costs, we may incur. There are several interpretations of these laws and regulations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, but if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, legal proceedings may be initiated against us, which may adversely affect our business.\nOur business may be negatively affected by terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nTerrorist attacks or natural disasters could cause economic instability. These events could negatively affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and harm demand for our products. The operations of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers\u2019 ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide raw materials and finished products.\nOur facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace. Various types of disasters, including fires, earthquakes, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our facilities and computer systems. In the event our existing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business", "PERMNO": 13453, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CEMI"}
