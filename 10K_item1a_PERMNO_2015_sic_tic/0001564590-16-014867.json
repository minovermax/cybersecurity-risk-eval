{"cik": "1534287", "company": "BioAmber Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have a limited operating history, a history of losses, anticipate continuing to incur losses for a period of time, and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have only been in existence since October 2008 and, therefore, we have a limited operating history upon which you can base your evaluation of our business. As a result, any assessments of our current business and predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could have been if we had a longer operating history. Since our inception, we have incurred substantial net losses, including net losses of $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect these losses to continue. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including those related to the development, continuation and operation of our additional manufacturing facilities, research, testing and development of new products and the growth of our sales and marketing efforts. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenues in future periods in order to become profitable. We cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nTo achieve profitability, we need to execute our manufacturing expansion strategy, including the ramp up of our facility in Sarnia, Ontario.\nWe are currently ramping up our first facility in cooperation with Mitsui in Sarnia, Ontario. We expect this facility to be operating at full capacity in 2017. We intend to build and operate additional facilities over the next three to five years. We have limited experience in operating a commercial-scale production facility, and our technology may not perform as expected in future plants\nThere is no guarantee that our Sarnia facility will produce at full capacity and even if we do meet these goals, we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to devise a workable solution or which may result in additional costs. To date, we have entered into agreements that contemplate, but do not obligate, us to supply approximately 28,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid and its derivatives per year until the end of 2017, and we are actively seeking to enter into additional supply agreements. Some of these supply agreements obligate our customers to exclusively fulfill their needs for bio-succinic acid from us, contingent on our ability to meet their price and other requirements, however there are no penalties in the event they do not purchase or we do not supply them with bio-succinic acid in the projected purchase volumes they have indicated in the agreements. Without increasing our production capacity by completing future facilities, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our customer relationships and commercialization growth may suffer.\nWe have entered into an offtake agreement with Vinmar which require us to supply bio-succinic acid to them. In the event that we are unable to supply Vinmar reliably with succinic acid according to the terms of our agreement, due to production or quality issues other than a force majeure, we would incur financial penalties payable to Vinmar.\nWe began operations at our facility in Sarnia, Ontario in October 2015 and we may encounter substantial difficulties in ramping up commercial operations and meeting the expectations of our customers. Because we produce all of our products at our single facility, any disruptions or delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe began commissioning and start-up of our Sarnia facility in March 2015, and started operations in October 2015. Because our facility is the first of its kind, none of our employees have had any prior experience in its operation. As a result, we may experience unforeseen challenges and difficulties and, until the operations stabilize and we obtain more experience operating a commercial scale facility, the Sarnia facility may be more susceptible to start-ups, shutdowns, quality issues, or other delays or disruptions. For example, in the first months of operations at the Sarnia facility, the plant encountered some operational inefficiencies related to human errors, equipment adjustments and minor equipment failures. We cannot know with certainty when or if we will achieve optimized operations. The skills and knowledge gained in operating our large-scale demonstration facility in Pomacle, France may prove insufficient for successful operation of a larger-scale commercial facility, and we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop our capabilities in commercial facility operations. We may also need to hire new employees or contract with third parties to help manage our operations, and our performance may suffer if we are unable to hire qualified parties or if they perform poorly.\nOur operations at our Sarnia, Ontario facility may be adversely affected by changes and events, including the following:\n\u00b7\nloss of key talent, including technical and administrative personnel, in operating the facility;\n\u00b7\nfailure to maintain or timely renew regulatory approvals, including environmental;\n\u00b7\nissues with the quality of our products produced at the facility;\n\u00b7\nshortages or changes in the price of equipment, materials or labor and related budget overruns;\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in the political and/or regulatory environment;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters, accidents or other unforeseen events;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient capital to continue operations at the facility and the inability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nworkplace health and safety issues at the facility;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with the external processing of our co-products;\n\u00b7\nissues associated with our environmental emissions, effluents, air and noise; and\n\u00b7\nfailure of a key piece of equipment, particularly one with long lead time delivery.\nCurrently, our only production site is our Sarnia facility. As a result, significant and prolonged disruptions at the facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations also may be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, severe weather conditions, workplace or environmental accidents, mechanical failure, fires, explosions, interruptions of supply, work stoppage, losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism. Some of these events can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension or cessation of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use would be very costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. In addition, telecommunications failures or other systems interruptions, such as computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, at any of the locations in which we do business could significantly disrupt our operations, laboratory processes and delay shipments to our customers. We can provide no assurance that we will not incur losses related to these or other events beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. Further, disruptions to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations during the period of time that the facility is not operating.\nIn addition, we may also experience difficulties in producing sufficient quantities or quality of products or in achieving sufficient quality and manufacturing yield levels. Our Sarnia facility is also subject to risks associated with having single suppliers for certain key inputs, such as sugar, power and steam, so the failure of any of these suppliers to perform as expected, would also have a material adverse effect on our performance and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully operate and manage our manufacturing operations at our Sarnia facility or otherwise fail to meet our manufacturing needs, we may not be able to provide our customers with the quality or quantity of products they require, and thus could lose customers and suffer reduced revenues which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe funding, construction and operation of our facilities involve significant risks.\nHaving only recently completed construction of our Sarnia, Ontario facility, and we have limited experience constructing a manufacturing facility of the type and size required to produce commercial quantities of chemicals, and doing so is a complex and lengthy undertaking that requires sophisticated, multi-disciplinary planning and precise execution. The funding, construction and operation of manufacturing facilities are subject to a number of risks, any of which could prevent us from executing on our expansion strategy. In particular, the construction costs associated with future facilities may materially exceed budgeted amounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the total completion cost of this initial phase of our Sarnia facility was revised to approximately $141.5 million, which was above the initial estimated cost of $125.0 million (plus or minus 10%). Additionally, while the Sarnia facility could be expanded in the future beyond its initial nameplate capacity of 30,000\nmetric tons, the likelihood, timing and size of an eventual expansion will be a function of the timing of construction of our planned second facility as we are unlikely to undertake two construction projects simultaneously.\nIf we incur future cost overruns, we may not be able to expand our production capacity and product portfolio as quickly as we planned. While our goal is to negotiate contracts with engineering, procurement and construction firms that minimize risk, any delays or cost overruns we encounter may result in the renegotiation of our construction contracts, which could increase our costs. Further, our expansion strategy will require us and/or our subsidiaries to raise additional funds, including through government grants, if available, and the incurrence of additional debt, which may be in the form of interest-free or interest-bearing loans and which may be secured or unsecured. Such additional debt will likely be substantial.\nIn addition, the construction of our facilities may be subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Such agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on a production facility that could potentially prevent construction from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. If construction costs, or the costs of operating and maintaining our manufacturing facilities, are higher than we anticipate, we may be unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may also encounter new design and engineering or operational challenges as we seek to expand the range of organisms and feedstocks we use. Any design and engineering or operational issues at our facilities may result in diminished production capacity, increased costs of operations or periods in which our facilities are non-operational, all of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to obtain and maintain insurance to protect against some of the risks relating to the construction of new projects. However, such insurance may not be available or adequate to cover lost revenues or increased costs if we experience construction problems, cost overruns or delays. If we are unable to address these risks in a satisfactory and timely manner, we may not be able to implement our expansion strategy as planned or at all. In addition, in the event that our products are defective or have manufacturing failures, we may have to write off and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet internal or external specifications. We also may have to write off work-in-process materials and incur other charges and expenses associated with contamination and impurities should they occur.\nOur failure to comply with milestone covenants contained in certain of our agreements, including certain debt instruments, government grants and government loans, could result in events of default, and if not cured, would require their accelerated or immediate repayment, in which case our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to make such repayments or fund our manufacturing expansion strategy.\nThe terms of our debt instruments require us to comply with various milestone covenants related to the start-up of our facility in Sarnia, Ontario. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of these debt instruments which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. In addition, we are party to certain agreements with governmental entities that provide grants and loans in connection with the operation of our Sarnia facility. If we fail to meet any of the milestones and project goals contained in these grant and loan agreements, we may be forced to repay grants received or the repayment of the loans may be accelerated. If we are forced to repay government grants or accelerate the repayment of government loans, our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to make such repayments or fund our manufacturing expansion strategy.\nWe have generated only limited sales of bio-succinic acid to date, are dependent on a limited number of customers and face challenges to developing our business.\nTo date, all our revenue has been derived from the sale of our bio-succinic acid through product and market development efforts related to our bio-succinic acid product, and we have not made sales of any other products. In order to generate sales of our bio-succinic acid and any future products, we must be able to achieve our production cost targets and produce sufficient quantities of our products, both of which are dependent on our ability to maintain our commercial-scale manufacturing facility and build additional manufacturing operations. If we are not successful in operating existing or constructing additional manufacturing facilities or otherwise increasing our manufacturing capacity, developing products that meet our customers\u2019 specifications, further advancing our commercial arrangements with existing customers and gaining new customers, we will be unable to generate meaningful revenue from the sale of our products. In addition, we depend, and expect to continue to depend, on a limited number of customers for sales of our bio-succinic acid. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 31% of our sales were to PTTMCC Biochem. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 47% our sales were to International Flavor and Fragrances, Inc., or IFF, Brenntag AG, or Brenntag and Olon Italy. In the future, a small number of customers may represent a significant portion of our total revenue in any given period. We\ncannot be certain that such customers will consistently purchase our products at any particular rate over any subsequent period. A loss of, or any credit issues related to, any of these customers or a failure to capture additional customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial obligations are expected to continue to be substantial, and we may not obtain the additional financing we need in order to grow our business, develop or enhance our products or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future in order to grow our business. Any required additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to secure financing and the cost of raising such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital markets conditions, credit availability from lenders, investor confidence and the existence of regulatory and tax incentives that are conducive to raising capital. Current turmoil and uncertainty in the financial markets has caused banks and financial institutions to decrease the amount of capital available for lending and has significantly increased the risk premium of such borrowings. In addition, such turmoil and uncertainty has significantly limited the ability of companies to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities. If we are unable to raise additional funds, obtain capital on acceptable terms, secure government grants or co-sponsorships for some of our projects or take advantage of federal and state incentive programs to secure favorable financing, we may have to delay, modify or abandon some or all of our expansion strategies.\nOur expansion strategy will require us and/or our subsidiaries to raise additional funds. The amount of any indebtedness that we may raise in the future may be substantial, and we may be required to secure such indebtedness with our assets and may have substantial interest expenses. If we default on any future indebtedness, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and our secured lenders may foreclose on the facilities securing such indebtedness. The incurrence of indebtedness could require us to meet financial and operating covenants, which could place limits on our operations and ability to raise additional capital, decrease our liquidity and increase the amount of cash flow required to service our debt. If we experience construction problems, cost overruns or delays that adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, we may not be able to fund principal or interest payments under any debt that we may incur.\nBased on our current operating plan, we anticipate that the net proceeds from our public offerings, equity contributions from Mitsui, the loan from funds managed by TCP, a combination of government grants, interest-bearing and interest-free loans and our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our currently planned operations. We have no additional committed external sources of funds and additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and the newly-issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to execute our business plan is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or refinance our indebtedness to meet our obligations. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be unable to fund our debt service obligations and be required to reduce or delay operating and capital expenses as deemed appropriate in order to conserve cash.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions or that any effort to sell additional debt or equity securities would be successful or would raise sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations or finance additional facilities or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, modify or abandon our expansion strategy and we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our offerings, revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur prior success in developing bio-succinic acid may not be indicative of our ability to leverage our bio-succinic acid technology to develop and commercialize derivatives of bio-succinic acid and other bio-based building block chemicals.\nThe success we have had in manufacturing bio-succinic acid using our four carbon, or C4, platform to date may not be indicative of our future ability to develop and commercialize derivatives of bio-succinic acid, and bio-based six carbon, or C6, building block chemicals. Although we expect to be able to leverage our bio-succinic acid technology for use in higher value-added products, we have never produced derivatives of bio-succinic acid or bio-based C6 building block chemicals at commercial scale. We may find that the new chemicals that we produce using our processes are more complex than we anticipated or require processes that we are unfamiliar with or which require larger scale development facilities than expected. The development of new products has required, and will require, that we expend significant financial and management resources. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant research and development expenses. If we are unable to devote adequate resources to develop new products or\ncannot otherwise successfully develop new products or enhancements that meet customer requirements on a timely basis, our products could lose market share, our revenues and/or margins could decline and we could experience operating losses. Although our management team has significant experience with industrial biotechnology, purification processes and chemical catalysis, the skills and knowledge gained in these fields and in the large-scale production of bio-succinic acid does not guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to cost-effectively produce and commercialize bio-succinic acid derivatives or bio-based C6 building block chemicals at commercial scale.\nIn addition, each of the chemicals that we plan to manufacture are used in multiple and diverse end-markets and applications, each of which present unique requirements, pricing pressures and competitors. As a result, we may not be able to sufficiently serve each end-market adequately. In order to effectively compete in the chemicals industry, we will need to, among other things, be able to adapt our development and production processes to meet the rapidly changing demands of the industry and our customers and ensure that the quality, performance attributes and cost of our bio-based products compare favorably to their petroleum-derived equivalents. In each end-market, there may also be barriers to entry due to third-party intellectual property rights or difficulties forming and maintaining strategic partnerships. In addition, the products currently derived from our processes and the feedstocks we use in the production of bio-succinic acid and our future products, may not be applicable to or compatible with demands in existing or future markets. We may not be able to identify new opportunities as they arise since future applications of any given product may not be readily determinable.\nIf we are not able to successfully develop, commercialize, produce and sell new products, we may be unable to expand our business. Consequently, we may not succeed in our strategy to expand our product platform as expected or at all. If our ability to expand our product platform is significantly delayed or if we are unable to leverage our bio-succinic acid platform as expected, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nDemand for our bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO, THF and other bio-succinic acid derivatives may take longer to develop or be reduced by technological innovations in our industry that allow our competitors to produce them at a lower cost.\nThe development of sufficient customer demand for bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO, THF and other bio-succinic acid derivatives will be affected by the cost competitiveness of our products, and the possible emergence of more competitive products. The market for bio-based chemicals will require most potential customers to switch from their existing petroleum-based chemical suppliers. In addition, there has been intense growth and interest in bio-based chemicals, and these industries are subject to rapid technological change and product innovation. Our products are based on our proprietary fermentation and purification process, but a number of companies are pursuing alternative processes and technologies and our success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. It is possible that those advances could make bio-succinic acid, bio-based 1,4 BDO, THF and other bio-succinic acid derivatives less efficient or obsolete, causing the renewable chemicals we produce to be of a lesser quality than competing bio-based chemicals or causing the yield of our products to be lower than that for competing technologies. These advances could also allow our competitors to produce bio-based chemicals at a lower cost than ours. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by our competitors or the costs associated with such new technologies.\nTechnological breakthroughs in our industry or innovations in alternative sources of bio-based chemicals could reduce demand for our products. Our technologies and products may be rendered uneconomical by technological advances, more efficient and cost-effective biocatalysts or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. If we are unable to adopt or incorporate technological advances or adapt our products to be competitive with new technologies, our costs could be significantly higher than those of our competitors, which could make our facilities and technology less competitive or uncompetitive.\nChanges we make to our business model, product development and manufacturing process, or changes to our commercial partnerships and collaborations may not yield the benefits we expect and may have adverse impacts that we did not anticipate.\nWe are continually working to lower our operating costs, improve our product performance, increase our speed to market and access new markets. As a result, we have made and will continue to make changes we believe will accomplish these goals. For example, we transitioned from an E. coli organism to our yeast for our Sarnia facility operations. In addition, we have expanded the breadth of products we are seeking to commercialize, and entered into a number of early stage partnerships and collaborations related to those products, that we believe will significantly increase our accessible market. We can give no assurances that these and other changes we make will yield the benefits we expect and will not have adverse impacts that we did not anticipate. If these changes are not successful, we may incur additional costs, experience reputational and competitive harm and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners, licensors, collaborators and other third parties for research and development, the funding, construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities and the commercialization of our products. The failure to manage these relationships could delay or prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\nWe have built our business largely by forming technology partnerships and licensing and other relationships with market leaders in the industrial biotechnology and chemicals industries. For example, through an exclusive worldwide license from Cargill, we have developed a next-generation yeast microorganism. In addition, we have developed a proprietary purification process that we believe will provide a key cost differentiator to our competitors by reducing the cost profile of our products and the capital intensity of our plants. We have also entered into license agreements with Davy for the conversion of succinic acid to BDO and THF, and with Celexion for the production of bio-based adipic acid and other C6 chemicals using a proprietary metabolic pathway. We expect that our ability to maintain and manage these collaborations will be significant factors in the success of our business.\nAlso, we expect that our ability to maintain and manage partnerships for the funding, construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities will be a significant factor in the success of our business.\nWe entered into a joint venture agreement with Mitsui for the financing and construction of our facility in Sarnia, Ontario. We began commissioning and start-up in March 2015, achieved mechanical completion in June 2015 and started commercial scale production in October 2015. Our joint venture with Mitsui also contemplates the potential construction and operation of an additional facility, which we expect to build and commission in late 2018. We may not be able to maintain our partnership with Mitsui if it decides to exercise certain rights granted to it in our joint venture agreement. In the event of an occurrence of a dissolution event under the agreement prior to December 31, 2020, Mitsui has the right to sell its shares and we have the obligation to purchase those shares at 100% of the investment value. The remaining dissolution events giving Mitsui this right are: (i) cumulative losses accrued from 2016 through 2020 exceeding 75% of paid-in capital, (ii) no after-tax profit earned in any three consecutive years from 2016 onwards, and (iii) any act of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar event. Until December 31, 2018, Mitsui in its sole discretion may sell its shares and we must purchase those shares at a discount of 50% to the cumulative investment value. In addition, we intend to leverage Mitsui\u2019s global sales platform for the commercialization of our products, and such commercialization efforts may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our relationship with Mitsui.\nWe are working with strategic partners and collaborators through whom we either own or license the technology needed to develop new specialty chemical products. We will rely on these partners to commercialize our products and the success of these relationships will impact the market opportunity and demand for our products across our target end-markets.\nOur partnering or collaboration opportunities could be harmed and our anticipated timelines could be delayed if:\n\u00b7\nwe do not achieve our objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nour existing or potential industry partners become unable, unwilling or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts with us due to general market conditions, their financial condition, feedstock pricing or other circumstances, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nwe disagree with a strategic partner or collaborator regarding strategic direction, economics of our relationship, intellectual property or other matters;\n\u00b7\nwe are unable to successfully manage multiple simultaneous partnering arrangements;\n\u00b7\nour strategic partners and collaborators breach or terminate their agreements with us or fail to perform their agreed activities or make planned equity contributions;\n\u00b7\nour industry partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors;\n\u00b7\napplicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability to enter into strategic arrangements;\n\u00b7\nwe develop processes or enter into additional partnering arrangements that conflict with the business objectives of our other arrangements; or\n\u00b7\nconsolidation in our target markets limits the number of potential industry partners.\nIf any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to commercialize our existing and future products, further develop our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our industry partners undergo a change of control or assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements.\nOur operations are dependent upon certain raw materials and utilities, principally sugars, hydrogen, steam and electricity, which make us vulnerable to supply availability and price fluctuations.\nWe are vulnerable to the supply availability and price fluctuations of certain raw materials and utilities, principally sugars, hydrogen (in the production of BDO and THF), steam and electricity. In some cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements in place, which may result in supply problems in the future. Our operations may also be adversely impacted by the failure of our suppliers to follow specific protocols and procedures or comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for sole-source supplies;\n\u2022\nwe may have production delays if products we source from alternative suppliers do not meet our standards;\n\u2022\nwe are not, and do not expect to become, a major customer of most of our suppliers and such suppliers may give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nIn the event one or more of our suppliers are unable to meet our supply demands, we may not be able to quickly replace them or find adequate supply from a different source. Any interruption or delay in the supply of sugars, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, steam or electricity, or our inability to obtain these raw materials and utilities from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers and expand our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the variable cost of our bio-succinic acid is based significantly on the price of sugars, which can be derived from corn (which we currently principally rely on), wheat, cane or other feedstocks. Fluctuations in the commodity prices of sugars or other inputs required in our production processes may reduce our profit margins, especially if we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our output at fixed or predictable prices. The price and availability of sugars or other inputs may be influenced by factors outside of our control, including general economic, market and regulatory factors. For instance, over the past five years, the price of corn ranged from a low of $2.82 per bushel to a high of $8.44 per bushel. As of March 7, 2016, the spot price was $3.49 per bushel and the six-month forward price was $3.64 per bushel We estimate that a $1.00 increase or decrease in the per bushel price of corn would result in just a $0.024 per pound change in the variable cost of our bio-succinic acid.\nOur failure to successfully introduce improved organisms and feedstocks into our processes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to introduce improved organisms into our processes and are working to increase our conversion yields, feedstock flexibility, manufacturing efficiency and product range through our research and development efforts and strategic partnerships. We may not, however, succeed in ramping up our yeast technology in Sarnia for a number of reasons, including our inability to adapt our purification process for our yeast, the failure of our yeast to produce products that meet the quality standards of our customers and a higher than expected production cost as a result of using our yeast. We plan to use our yeast in future facilities, but the implementation may not be as seamless as we expect, and our yeast may require different operating conditions or otherwise differ from our expectations and design.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have significantly expanded our business since our inception and have grown to 98 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015. We currently conduct our business in several countries, including the United States, Europe and Canada, and we may continue to expand geographically in the future. We expect our growth to continue and accelerate in connection with our expansion strategy. As our operations continue to expand, we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various\nthird parties. We may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate, manage our expanding operations effectively or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. Managing our anticipated growth and expanding our operations will require us to do, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nenhance our operational, financial and management controls and infrastructure, human resource policies, and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022effectively scale our operations, including successfully constructing future manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ndiversify our product line to leverage our bio-succinic acid for use in multiple value-added products and derivatives, and develop bio-based C6 building block chemicals;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify, recruit, train, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees and continue to retain, motivate and manage our existing employees;\n\u2022\nmaintain partnerships with third parties for the development of our technologies, funding and construction of our plants and the commercialization of our products; and\n\u2022maintain, defend and grow our intellectual property portfolio.\nThese enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, which will place a strain on our operational, financial and management infrastructure. Our future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth and expansion. There are no guarantees we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner, or at all. Our failure to effectively manage growth and expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into certain non-binding letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements with future customers and others, and cannot assure you that such arrangements will lead to definitive agreements, which could harm our commercial prospects.\nWe have entered into non-binding letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements with future customers and others. We have also entered several non-binding memoranda of understanding with third parties related to our product development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate final terms and enter into definitive agreements with any of our future customers or others in a timely manner, or at all, and there is no guarantee that the terms of any final, definitive, binding agreement will be favorable to us or reflect the terms currently contemplated under the letters of intent, memoranda of understanding and other arrangements we have. Delays in negotiating final, definitive, binding agreements could slow the development and commercialization of the products in our pipeline, which could prevent us from growing our business, result in wasted resources and cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate.\nWe have signed a binding 15-year offtake agreement for 1,4 BDO and THF with Vinmar, under which Vinmar has committed to purchase 100% of the BDO and THF produced in our next plant, a 100,000 metric ton per year capacity plant that we plan to build in North America and commission in late 2018. Vinmar also plans to invest in the BDO plant alongside us. Following the financing, construction and commissioning of the 100,000 metric ton BDO and THF plant, Vinmar will be obligated to purchase 100% of the BDO and THF produced there for 15 years, and we will be obligated to sell exclusively to Vinmar. As part of the agreement, Vinmar has a right of first refusal to invest in and secure 100% of the off-take from a second BDO plant that BioAmber would build in the future. While this agreement is binding, our inability to finance and construct the BDO plant would relieve Vinmar of its obligation to purchase BDO and THF under the terms of the offtake agreement. We have signed a second offtake agreement in July 2014 with Vinmar to supply 10,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid per year for 15 years from the Sarnia plant. This offtake agreement also covers our next plant, which will have an annual nameplate capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year of bio-succinic acid, with Vinmar committed to off-taking 50,000 metric tons of the bio-succinic acid produced there for 15 years. Vinmar has also committed to off-take 150,000 metric tons of the production from our third plant, which has a planned nameplate capacity of 200,000 metric tons per year.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the product specification requirements of our customers or that our products will be accepted by our target customers.\nWe are currently selling our bio-succinic acid to customers today after having met their quality, purity, performance and cost requirements and intend to sell our product to other customers in the chemicals industry. These sales were made in connection with our product and market development efforts. We also intend to expand our market reach with the new products that we are developing as alternatives to the chemicals currently in use. Our potential customers include large specialty chemical companies that have well-developed manufacturing processes for the chemicals they use or pre-existing arrangements with suppliers for the chemical components they need. These potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers during which time they test and certify our products for use in their processes and, in some cases, determine whether products that contain the chemicals produced using our processes satisfy additional third-party specifications. Meeting these suitability standards could be a time-consuming and expensive process and we may invest substantial time and resources into such qualification efforts without ultimately securing approval by our customers. If we are unable to convince our potential customers that our products are equivalents of or comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that using our products is otherwise beneficial to them, we will not be successful in expanding our market and our business will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, agreements for the sale and purchase of our products are customarily subject to the satisfaction of certain technical, commercial and production requirements. These agreements contain conditions that we and our counterparties agree on product specifications for our chemical products and that our products conform to those specifications. If we do not satisfy these contractual requirements, demand for our products and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nIf the recent decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum-based succinic acid and other chemicals continues, the gross margins and or the demand for our products may decrease.\nThe bio-succinic acid we produce is a renewable alternative to petroleum-based succinic acid. Based on our current financial modeling with respect to our facility in Sarnia, Ontario, we anticipate that if the price of oil falls below $30 per barrel for a sustained period of time and corn prices are above $4.00 per bushel, the resulting selling price of our succinic acid would result in lower gross margins and we may be unable to compete on cost with petroleum-based succinic acid products, which would adversely impact our operating results. World prices for oil have fluctuated widely in recent years. For example, during the last five years the market price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a low of $26.21 to a high of $112.93 and was $37.90 on March 7, 2016 $37.19. In addition, recently, oil prices have declined significantly. From January 2, 2015 through March 11, 2016, the West Texas Intermediate posted oil price had declined from a high of $61.43 per barrel of oil to a low of $26.21 per barrel of oil. We expect that prices will continue to fluctuate, and may continue to decline in the future. Declining oil prices, or the perception of a future decline in oil prices, may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers, dissuade potential customers from entering into agreements with us to buy our products, and delay or modify our expansion and investment strategies or those of our collaborators. In addition, a sustained drop in oil prices will reduce the price of certain petrochemicals, making it uneconomical to produce them from our bio-based succinic acid feedstock. These include the production of butadiene and N-vinyl pyrrolidone, which are not economical when oil prices are below $50 to $70 per barrel. A sustained period of oil prices at or below $30 per barrel could also make it uneconomical to sell bio-succinic acid at the same market price as petroleum-derived adipic acid, thereby slowing the substitution of adipic acid in polyurethane and coatings markets.\nFor example, the significant decline in global oil prices over the past 18 months has moderately reversed a shift in recent years from naphtha cracking to natural gas liquid cracking in certain geographies that historically resulted in increased volatility of the prices of petroleum-derived C4 chemicals for which we produce and intend to produce bio-based alternatives. As a result, this reversal may lead to less demand for our bio-based products. Additionally, the significant slowdown in oil and gas drilling operations in North America has led us to believe that n-vinyl-pyrrolidone, or NVP, for which we have established a collaboration with a specialty chemicals company, will not be a near-term market opportunity for our succinic acid.\nThe addressable market sizes we believe exists for bio-succinic acid and the products we plan to sell in the future are based on management\u2019s estimates and third-party information, and the actual market sizes may be smaller that we believe.\nManagement\u2019s estimates of the addressable market sizes are based on industry reports from 2008 through today, pricing information in the industry reports and from ICIS pricing, publicly available information and management\u2019s estimates of what portion of the total market size may be addressable through bio-succinic acid. In many cases, such information and reports differ among sources as to addressable market sizes. While we believe that management\u2019s estimates and these sources are reliable, there may be significant differences in actual market size compared to the information presented.\nIf the addressable markets for bio-succinic acid and the products we plan to sell in the future are smaller than we expect, then it may be more difficult for us to achieve our business plan and to attain profitability and meet our expectations with respect to cash flow.\nSome of our competitors have significantly more experience and resources than we do and technology developed by our competitors could become more commercially successful than our technology, which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share.\nCompetition in the bio-based chemicals business from other chemicals companies is well established, with many substantial entities having well-financed multi-national operations. Our products will compete against those produced by established companies, including a collaborative venture between DSM and Roquette Fr\u00e8res S.A., as well as a collaborative venture between BASF and Corbion. Competition in the bio-based chemicals business is expanding with the growth of the industry and the evolution of new technologies. In addition to competing with new technologies, we also compete against traditional petroleum-derived chemicals, many of which are produced by large companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger companies, due to their better capitalization, will be better-positioned to develop and commercialize new technologies, build new production facilities and install existing or more advanced equipment, which could reduce our market share and harm our business. In addition, our products could face competition from those produced by early stage companies, such as Genomatica Inc. and Myriant Corporation. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to deploy and operate our technologies and cost effectively produce renewable alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals. Some of our competitors are developing new technologies that may be more successful than our technology. These competitors may also have substantially greater production, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do or may benefit from local government programs and incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered less competitive by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility increases of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential markets, which could lead to litigation. In addition, we may be subject to aggressive competitive tactics from our competitors, who may use their strong positions in the market and established relationships with existing suppliers and customers to take measures that negatively affect our ability to compete effectively in this industry. Our inability to maintain our competitiveness and grow our market share may, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals or permits could adversely affect our operations.\nWhile our business currently has all necessary operating approvals material to our current facility in Sarnia, we will need to obtain and maintain numerous regulatory approvals and permits in order to operate our planned manufacturing facilities. In any given jurisdiction, new legislation could be implemented that would require additional or new regulatory approvals. Obtaining necessary approvals and permits could be a time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not be able to obtain them on a timely basis or at all. In the event that we fail to ultimately obtain all necessary permits, we may be forced to delay operations of the facility and the receipt of related revenues or abandon the project altogether and lose the benefit of any development costs already incurred, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, governmental regulatory requirements may substantially increase our construction costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals, the operation of our facilities or the sale of our bio-based chemicals could be delayed. For example, many countries require registration of chemicals before they can be distributed in the country, and a failure to register our chemicals would limit our ability to expedite sales into these markets. In addition, we may be required to make capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with increasingly stringent federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. We could also experience delays in obtaining approval for the sale of our waste streams as nutrients for animal feed, which would hinder our ability to reduce our cost of goods by restricting our ability to turn a disposal cost into a source of revenue.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nWe have completed building and are currently operating a manufacturing facility in Sarnia, Ontario, and we plan to build and operate additional manufacturing facilities in the future. Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with various Canadian, U.S. and other laws, including export control laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in or uncertainties relating to foreign rule and regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export or import restrictions, restrictions on remittances abroad, imposition of duties or taxes that limit our ability to move our products out of these countries or interfere with the import of essential materials into these countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on production, sale or export of bio-based chemicals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nimposition of differing labor laws and standards;\n\u2022\neconomic, political or social instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nan inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.\nWe expect that we will begin expanding into other target markets, however there can be no assurance that our expansion plans will be realized, or if realized, be successful. We expect each market to have particular regulatory, feedstock sourcing and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets, including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us. If we expend significant time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed, our business, reputation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nNatural or man-made disasters, political, social or economic instability, or occurrence of a catastrophic or disruptive event in any of the areas where our existing or planned manufacturing facilities are located may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe plan to build and operate manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout the world near sources of feedstock and our target markets. The operation of facilities may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires, tsunamis, epidemics and nuclear disasters. Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use would be very costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. In addition, telecommunications failures or other systems interruptions, such as computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, at any of the locations in which we do business could significantly disrupt our operations, laboratory processes and delay shipments to our customers. Even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large disasters, terrorist attacks, systems failures or other events could have a significant impact on our partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 businesses, which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, or our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses, due to natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn the event any of our facilities are affected by a disaster, we may:\n\u2022\nbe unable to meet the deadlines of our customers;\n\u2022\nexperience disruptions in our ability to manufacture and ship our products and otherwise operate our business, which could negatively impact our business;\n\u2022\nneed to expend significant capital and other resources to address any damage caused by the disaster; and\n\u2022\nlose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter.\nOur precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance and health and safety protocols, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, our facilities may experience unscheduled downtime or may not otherwise operate as planned or expected, which could have adverse consequences on our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe use biological materials and genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, in our production processes and are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture and disposal of these materials. For example, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, and analogous state laws and regulations impose requirements on the production, importation, use and disposal of chemicals and GMOs in the United States. In Canada, similar regulatory programs exist under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. In particular, a regulatory program similar to TSCA requires that Environment Canada approve the manufacture of any chemical not already included on the Domestic Substances List, or DSL. We have secured approval from Environment Canada for our use of yeast in the manufacture of our bio-based succinic acid and the derivatives of succinic acid that we plan to commercialize. If Environment Canada requires our future C6-based products to undergo extensive testing, which we currently do not anticipate, securing approval to manufacture such products could potentially be subject to significant delays or costs. In the European Union, we are subject to a chemical regulatory program known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances). Under REACH, we are required to register our products with the European Commission. The registration process requires the submission of information to demonstrate the safety of chemicals as used and could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of our products in the European Union.\nWe obtained requisite regulatory approvals for the use of our yeast in Canada. Although we have implemented safety procedures for the disposal of yeast and waste products to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our safety measures are compliant or capable of eliminating the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and the failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, regulatory oversight costs, third party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations, and our liability may exceed our total assets. We expect to encounter similar laws and regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to establish production capabilities, and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, requiring us to change our operations, or imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. Similarly, our business may be harmed if initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which tend to improve the competitiveness of our products relative to petrochemicals, do not become legally enforceable requirements, or if existing legally enforceable requirements relating to greenhouse gases are amended or repealed in the future. The costs of complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe use chemicals and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal, regional/state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products, we cannot be sure that our safety measures are compliant with legal requirements or adequate to eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that we will not violate environmental, health and safety laws as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming, and the failure to comply with past, present, or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Our liability in such an event may exceed our total assets. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. Accordingly, violations of present and future environmental laws could restrict our ability to expand facilities,\nor pursue certain technologies, and could require us to acquire equipment or incur potentially significant costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nLoss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could harm our research and development efforts, delay launch of new products and impair our ability to meet our business objectives.\nOur business involves complex operations spanning a variety of disciplines that demands a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas necessary for our operations. While we have been successful in attracting experienced, skilled professionals to our company, the loss of any key member of our management team or key research and development or operational employees, or the failure to attract and retain additional such employees, could slow our development and commercialization of our products for our target markets and executing our business plans. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology-based businesses and the scarcity of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business. Hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is a lengthy and expensive process. The market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to support our internal research and development programs or satisfy customer demands for our products. In particular, our product development and research and development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific, technical and operational personnel. Competition for such personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. Substantially all of our employees are at-will employees, which means that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, including those related to product liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, property damages or civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. In the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued liability, or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nIn addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position. In addition, the development, production and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. Our products may contain undetected defects or impurities that are not discovered until after the products have been used by customers and incorporated into products for end-users. This could result in claims from our customers or others, which could damage our business and reputation and entail significant costs to correct. We may also be sued for defects resulting from errors of our commercial partners or unrelated third parties, but any product liability claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in material expense, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business and reputation. Insurance coverage is expensive, may be difficult to obtain or not available on acceptable terms and may not adequately cover potential claims or losses. If claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may go out of business. In addition, insurance coverage may become more expensive, which would harm our results of operations.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial markets may prevent the successful development and commercialization of our products, as well as significantly harm our results of operations and ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and market conditions. The worldwide economy has been experiencing significant economic turbulence, and global credit and capital markets have experienced substantial volatility and disruption. These adverse conditions and general concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies could limit our partners\u2019 or potential partners\u2019 ability or willingness to invest in new technologies or capital. Moreover, these economic and market conditions could negatively impact our current and prospective customers\u2019 ability or desire to purchase and pay for our products, or negatively impact our feedstock prices and other operating costs or the prices for our products. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to address liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Significant government investment and allocation of resources to assist the economic recovery of various sectors which do not include the bio-based chemical industry may reduce the resources available for government grants and related funding that could assist our\nexpansion plans or otherwise benefit us. Any one of these events, and continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions, could prevent the successful and timely development and commercialization of our products, as well as significantly harm our results of operations and ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nIf we engage in any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and face numerous potential risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may acquire additional businesses, assets, technologies, or products to enhance our business in the future. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nassume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective collaborators, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. We do not have experience in managing the integration process and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business. Acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in Luxembourg, the United States and Canada. We have incurred significant losses and have not generated taxable income in these jurisdictions, with the exception of Canada. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $17.7 million of net operating loss carryforwards (or NOLs) in Canada. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $116.5 million of U.S. federal tax NOLs. Each jurisdiction in which we operate may have its own limitations on our ability to utilize NOL or tax credit carryovers generated in that jurisdiction. Also, we generally cannot utilize NOLs or tax credits generated in one jurisdiction to reduce our liability for taxes in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may be subject to tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate notwithstanding the existence of NOLs or tax credits in other jurisdictions. In general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change has occurred after each of our previous issuances of common stock and warrants. In addition, if we undergo an ownership change as a result of any offerings that we may undertake, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. We have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nEthical, legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes, and similar concerns about feedstocks grown on land that could be used for food production, could limit or prevent the use of our products, processes and technologies and limit our revenues.\nSome of our processes involve the use of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. The use of GMOs is subject to laws and regulations in many countries, some of which are new and some of which are still evolving. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates the commercial use of GMOs as well as potential products from the GMOs. Public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and GMOs could influence public acceptance of our technology and products.\nWhile our yeast has been approved for use in Canada and has been given the lowest classification in terms of risk, our ability to commercialize our products in the future could be impacted by the following factors:\n\u2022\npublic attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetically engineered products and processes, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u2022\npublic attitudes regarding, and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material, which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage others from supporting, developing or commercializing our products, processes and technologies;\n\u2022\npublic attitudes and ethical concerns surrounding production of feedstocks on land which could be used to grow food, which could influence public acceptance of our technologies, products and processes;\n\u2022\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically engineered organisms, which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental reaction to negative publicity concerning feedstocks produced on land which could be used to grow food, which could result in greater government regulation of feedstock sources.\nAny of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses, delays or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions. In addition, the subjects of genetically engineered organisms and food versus fuel have received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically engineered products or feedstocks grown on land suitable for food production.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting was in the inappropriate review process of non-routine complex financial instruments in an inappropriate review process of non-routine complex financial instruments that may have embedded derivatives or other provisions that may have complex accounting impacts, and resulted in an error in the accounting treatment of the legacy warrants. This error resulted in the reclassification of the legacy warrants from equity to a non-cash liability and in the correction of our comparative consolidated financial statements as presented in the Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8). The accounting treatment of warrants previously issued was reviewed during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and we determined that the error was limited to these legacy warrants. Our review process for non-routine complex financial instruments allowed this error to go undetected, and management has assessed the potential magnitude and concluded that this represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, but did not result in a material misstatement in our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2014 or any interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters included therein. We have taken certain actions to remediate this material weakness, including, improving processes and implementing additional controls around review of new complex financial instruments to identify appropriate accounting treatment and monitoring implication thereafter, and strengthening management\u2019s review controls. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness that has been identified, or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring. We also cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material weaknesses. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting during any period in accordance with the provisions of Sarbanes Oxley. In light of the control deficiencies and the resulting material weakness that were previously identified as a result of the limited procedures performed, we believe that it is possible that, had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley, additional material weaknesses and significant control deficiencies may have been identified.\nIf we identify future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or fail to meet the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Under Section 404, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with the annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (or such earlier date if we cease to be an emerging growth company) if we are not a smaller reporting company as of such time, comply with the auditor attestation requirements on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to comply with Section 404 could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. We cannot assure that our existing material weakness will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not exist or otherwise be discovered, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (and cease to take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d), we incurred and will incur significant legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not face as a private company. As a public company, we are subject to rules and regulations that regulate corporate governance practices of public companies, including the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules promulgated by the NYSE. The compliance with these public company requirements increased and will increase our costs and make some activities more time consuming and may result in a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities. For example, we created new board committees, adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, and devoted significant management resources to our SEC reporting requirements. A number of those requirements will require us to carry out activities we have not performed previously. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain our internal controls and accounting capabilities or subsequently identify any issues in complying with those requirements (for example, if we or our registered public accounting firm identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting), such as that identified in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect us, our reputation or investor perceptions of us. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed on us by these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of our related legal, accounting and administrative activities significantly. These increased costs required and will continue to require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and have elected to take advantage of reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and delaying the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until they are applicable to private companies. As a result of our election to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive as a result of our choice to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years after our initial public offering, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by\nnon-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nIf we fail to augment and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. In that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nOur management is required to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, Section 404 may require our auditors to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in conjunction with their opinion on our audited financial statements beginning with the second annual report that we will be required to file with SEC. However, we have elected to take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d under the JOBS Act and therefore we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until after the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, which may be up to five years from our initial public offering.\nThe process of designing and implementing effective internal controls and procedures, and expanding our internal accounting capabilities, is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to establish and maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We cannot be certain at this time whether we will be able to successfully complete the implementation of controls and procedures or the certification and attestation requirements of Section 404. In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements. See \u201c-We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\u201d In the future we may have significant deficiencies, which could cause us to fail to meet the periodic reporting obligations that we will be subject to under Section 404 or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If we identify and report a material weakness or any additional significant deficiencies, it could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts publish about us, our industry and our business. We cannot assure you that any research analysts will continue to provide research coverage on us or our securities. We do not have any control over these analysts. The market price of our securities and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our securities, issue unfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, our industry or our business.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result of these fluctuations, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts covering our company or of investors, which could cause the market price of our securities to decline. Future quarterly fluctuations, many of which are beyond our control, may result from a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost associated with the construction of our additional planned manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of expenses for product development and sales, general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ndelays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the scale-up and the commercialization of chemicals produced using our processes;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully enter into or maintain partnering arrangements, and the terms of those relationships;\n\u2022\ncommercial success with our existing product and success in identifying and sourcing new product opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe development of new competitive technologies or products by others and competitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the prices or availability of the feedstocks required to produce chemicals using our processes or those of our competitors, including producers of petroleum-based chemicals;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our products, including any seasonal variations in demand and fluctuations due to volatility in the global petroleum market;\n\u2022\nchanges in product development costs due to the achievement of certain milestones under third-party development agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amount that we invest to develop, acquire or license new technologies and processes;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions, including disruptions in the production process at any facility where chemicals produced using our processes are manufactured as well as a result of changes in the technologies we employ;\n\u2022\ndepartures of executives or other key management employees;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental, accounting and tax rules and regulations, environmental, health and safety requirements, and other rules and regulations.\nBased on the above factors and other uncertainties, we believe our future operating results will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur inability to adequately protect, or any loss of our intellectual property rights, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our products from competition. We rely principally on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and physical security measures to establish and protect the intellectual property rights relevant to our business. We own or have rights in issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our technologies, including the microorganism (biocatalyst) we use in our fermentation processes, methods of producing our products, and the use of our products in specific applications. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, collaboration partners and scientific and other business advisers. These measures, which seek to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or other violation, may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or processes in a timely fashion, or at all, or abandon applications when we determine that a product or method is no longer of interest;\n\u2022\nwe cannot predict which of our pending patent applications, if any, will result in issued patents for various reasons, including the existence of prior art that we had not been aware of, conflicting patents by others, or defects in our applications;\n\u2022\nwe do not know whether the examination of any of our patent applications by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or any similar foreign patent offices will require us to narrow or even cancel any of the claims in our pending patent applications, or to abandon a patent application altogether;\n\u2022\neven if our patents are granted, they may be challenged by third parties through reexamination or interference proceedings in the U.S., or opposition or cancellation proceedings in Europe, or via similar proceedings in other jurisdictions, which could result in the cancellation of certain of our patent claims or the loss of the challenged patent entirely;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to protect some of our technologies, and even if we receive patent or similar protection, the scope of our intellectual property rights may offer insufficient protection against lawful competition or unauthorized use;\n\u2022\nour products and processes may rely on the technology of others and, therefore, may require us to obtain intellectual property licenses, if available, from third parties in order for us to manufacture or commercialize our products or practice our processes;\n\u2022\nthe patents we have been granted or may be granted may not include claims covering our products and processes, may lapse or expire, be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or be deemed unenforceable, or we may abandon them;\n\u2022\nour confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement prohibitive;\n\u2022\nwe may not be aware of infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, or we may elect not to seek to prevent them;\n\u2022\nour efforts to safeguard our trade secrets may be insufficient to prohibit the disclosure of our confidential information;\n\u2022\neven if we enforce our rights aggressively, injunctions, fines and other penalties may be insufficient to deter violations of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022if we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, anti-competitive, otherwise unenforceable, or are already licensed to the party against whom we are asserting the claim; and\n\u2022other persons may independently develop proprietary technology, information and processes that are functionally equivalent or superior to our proprietary intellectual property and processes but do not infringe or conflict with our patented or unpatented proprietary rights, or may use their own proprietary intellectual property rights to block us from taking full advantage of the market.\nOur patent rights may not protect us against competition.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to obtain patent protection in the United States and in other countries for patent applications that we own or in-license from others that cover certain technologies used in, or relating to, our products and processes. Interpreting the scope and validity of patents and success in prosecuting patent applications involves complex legal and factual questions, and the issuance, scope, validity, and enforceability of a patent cannot be predicted with any certainty. Patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in secret and/or in territories where we do not have patent protection. Such third parties may then try to sell or import resulting products in and into the United States or other territories. We may be unable to prove that such products were made using our inventions or infringed our intellectual property rights. Additional uncertainty may result from recent changes in the U.S. patent laws under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, and from legal precedent handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the courts of other countries, as they determine legal issues relating to the scope, validity and construction of patent claims. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, but many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have only recently become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business.\nIn addition, because patent applications in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, if at all, and because the publication of discoveries in the scientific literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, there is additional uncertainty as to the priority dates of our inventions compared to inventions by others, and uncertainty\nas to the patentability of the claims in our pending patent applications and the validity and enforceability of claims in our issued patents. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications will result in issued patents, or if issued, the validity and/or enforceability of the issued patents. Also, we cannot guarantee that a competing patent application will not be granted with claims that cover our proposed organism or processes, or that our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications or patents will not be subject to an interference proceeding with a competing patent or patent application.\nMoreover, we cannot be sure that any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights will be broad enough in scope to provide commercial advantage and prevent circumvention. Furthermore, patents are enforceable only for a limited term, and some of the U.S. patents that we have in-licensed exclusively relating to our biocatalyst have started to expire in 2015.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, or lawsuits asserted by a third party, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and/or technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable, as is enforcing these rights against unauthorized use by others. Identifying unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult because we may be unable to monitor the processes and/or materials being employed by other parties. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a patent of ours or our licensors may be found invalid, unenforceable, anti-competitive or not infringed. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThird parties may challenge our or our licensors\u2019 patents via reexamination proceedings or inter partes review in the United States, opposition or cancellation proceedings in Europe, or similar proceedings in other jurisdictions. The outcome of these proceedings can be unpredictable and may result in the claims being substantially narrowed or cancelled altogether. As a result of changes in U.S. patent law under the Leahy-Smith Act, any U.S. patent that we or our licensors obtain having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013 could be challenged by a third party using the new post-grant review process, which could result in the claims of the challenged patents being narrowed or even cancelled. Furthermore, in the United States, patents with an effective filing date prior to March 16, 2013 are awarded to the first person to make an invention rather than to the first person to file a patent application, and therefore such patents could be subject to an interference proceeding conducted by the USPTO to determine which party was the first to create an invention. As result, interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. As a result, our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may take several years to resolve, result in substantial costs, and distract our management and other employees, and otherwise interfere with the running of our business. We may be unable to prevent, alone or with our licensors, infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively affect our rights, competitive position and business.\nWe may in the future decide to build, or partner with others in building manufacturing facilities using our technologies in countries other than the United States and Canada. We may not have sufficient patent or other intellectual property rights in those countries to prevent a competitor from using our or competing technologies. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal, state and provincial laws in the United States and Canada. Many companies have encountered problems in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us or our licensors to prevent or stop any infringement of our or our licensors\u2019 patents or misappropriation of the subject matter of our other proprietary or intellectual property rights. Proceedings to enforce our and our licensors\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or in-license.\nWe may be unable to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to costly litigation or prevent us from offering certain products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we are currently unaware of any claims or threatened claims, our ability to manufacture and commercialize our proposed technologies, processes and products depends upon our and our licensors\u2019 ability to develop, manufacture, market, license and/or sell such technologies, processes and products without violating the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in fields that relate to our proposed technologies, processes and products and our underlying methodologies and discoveries. In addition, many companies actively police and enforce their intellectual property rights, including their patent rights, to gain a competitive advantage. Third parties may allege that our existing or proposed technologies, processes and products or our methods infringe their intellectual property rights. It is possible that the number and frequency of lawsuits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a greater risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. If the making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing of our proposed products or practice of our proprietary technologies or processes are found to infringe third party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology, process or product unless we obtain a license under the applicable third party patent and pay royalties or are able to design around such patent. Securing rights to such third party intellectual property, or securing non-enforcement commitments from such third parties, could result in the payment of additional royalty fees in the form of one-time payments and/or running royalties, which would negatively impact our net margins.\nWe may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may be unable to redesign our products, biocatalysts or processes to avoid infringement. Even if we are able to redesign our products, biocatalysts or processes to avoid an infringement claim, our efforts to design around the patent could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may lead to an inferior or more costly product and/or process. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management and employees, and generally interfere with our business. Furthermore, if any such claim is successful, a court could order us to pay substantial damages, including compensatory damages for any infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently prohibit us, our licensees and our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing one or more of our products or practicing our proprietary technologies or processes, or could enter an order requiring us to undertake certain remedial activities. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely in part on trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and security procedures, which can be difficult to protect and enforce, and which may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information; our failure to obtain or maintain such protections could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely in part on trade secret laws and contractual agreements to protect some of our confidential and proprietary information, technology and processes, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We have taken various measures to protect our trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, including requiring new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting engagement with us. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and protect and our security procedures may be insufficient to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets. In addition, discussions with our business partners, including our licensors, may require us to share confidential and proprietary information with them and other third parties. Our business partners\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other business advisers may unintentionally or willfully breach their confidentiality and/or non-use obligations, including by disclosing our confidential or proprietary information to our competitors. Such agreements may be deemed unenforceable, fail to provide adequate remedies, or become subject to disputes that may not be resolved in our favor. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. Furthermore, trade secret laws do not prevent our competitors from independently developing equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how that could be used to compete with us and our products.\nWe may lose our competitive advantage if our competitors develop similar, analogous or alternative organisms that produce bio-succinic acid or other competing chemical products.\nWe currently use proprietary microorganisms (biocatalysts) in our production of bio-succinic acid and other cellular metabolites such as C6 compounds. If our organisms are stolen, or misappropriated, they could be used by third parties for their own commercial gain, even though they may be in breach of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may use similar or analogous\norganisms in jurisdictions where we or our licensors do not have patent protection. Third parties may also independently develop similar, analogous or alternative organisms that can also produce bio-succinic acid or other metabolites without infringing our intellectual property rights. If any of these were to occur, it could be difficult for us to discover, challenge or prevent the third party from using their organisms and competing with us in the production of bio-succinic acid or other metabolites.\nOur rights to key intellectual property are in-licensed from third parties, and the limitation or termination of these and related agreements would be highly detrimental to us and our business.\nWe are a party to certain license agreements that provide us with the right to practice key technology used in our business. For example, we have entered into license agreements with Cargill for our yeast to produce bio-succinic acid, Davy for catalysts and methods for converting our bio-succinic acid into bio-based 1,4 BDO and Celexion for a metabolic pathway to make C6 compounds, such as adipic acid. All of these license agreements impose various obligations on us, including royalty payments and, in certain instances, milestone payments. If we fail to comply with these or other obligations, certain agreements provide that the licensors may have the right to terminate the license or convert the exclusive license to a nonexclusive license, in which case our competitors may gain access to these important licensed technologies, and we may be unable to develop or market products, technologies or processes covered by the licensed intellectual property. Often our licensors have the right to control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of the licensed intellectual property and, if a third party infringes any of the licensed intellectual property, some of our licensors may control the resulting legal or other proceeding against that third party to stop or prevent such infringement. As a result, our licensors may take actions or make decisions relating to these matters that could harm our business or impact our rights.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. Between June 10, 2013 (the date our common stock commenced trading) and December 31, 2015, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $15.29 per share to a low of $2.86, and on March 11, 2016, the closing sale price of our common stock was $3.99 per share. Our start of commercial operations of our Sarnia facility, our ability to commence commercial sales and execute on our commercial expansion plan, our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates and our ability to meet such estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. In addition securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on the NYSE.\nMarket conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. Concerns over global stability and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have contributed to the extreme volatility of the markets which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of common stock or warrants by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock or warrants in the public market the trading price of our common stock or warrants could decline significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future public sales of these securities or the availability of these securities for sale will have on the market and trading price of our securities. Holders of 8,488,213 shares of our common stock, including the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our stock options and all outstanding warrants have the right to require us to register these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to a stockholders\u2019 agreement. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or warrants in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market and trading price of our securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital or issue stock in connection with acquisitions. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of warrants, stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market and trading price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur legacy warrants and IPO warrants contain anti-dilution adjustment mechanisms that may be triggered by issuances of equity by us at prices below the then-prevailing exercise prices for such warrants.\nAll of the IPO warrants, and the legacy warrants that we issued in June 2009 and April 2011 contain anti-dilution protection in the event that we issue any common stock, securities convertible into common stock, or other securities at a price below the then-existing exercise price of such warrants, with certain exceptions. The anti-dilution protection contains a price adjustment and an adjustment to the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants. This anti-dilution protection was triggered in connection with our underwritten public offerings in 2015 and January 2016. The issuance of additional securities in connection with the adjustment to the exercise price of such warrants could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote, and not less than 75% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Also, absent approval of our board of directors, our amended and restated by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.\nThe warrants sold as part of our initial public offering may not have any value, and the holders of those warrants will have no rights as common stockholders until such holders exercise their warrants and acquire our common stock.\nThe warrants sold as part of our initial public offering will expire at 5:30 p.m. on May 9, 2017 unless we in our sole discretion extend the expiration date. In the event our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the warrants during the period when the warrants are exercisable, the warrants may not have any value. Until holders of warrants acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, holders of warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying such warrants. Upon exercise of the warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.", "PERMNO": 13977, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "BIOAQ"}
