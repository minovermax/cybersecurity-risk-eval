{"cik": "1364742", "company": "BlackRock Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock\u2019s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company\u2019s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.\nMARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS\nChanges in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d), revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause:\n\u2022\nthe value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;\n\u2022\nthe withdrawal of funds from BlackRock\u2019s products in favor of products offered by competitors;\n\u2022\nthe rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;\n\u2022\nan impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nChanges in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company\u2019s net income and operating cash flows.\nIn recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock\u2019s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock\u2019s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. Any failure by BlackRock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company\u2019s base fees, net income and operating cash flows.\nIn addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock\u2019s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.\nBlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock\u2019s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund\u2019s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds\u2019 respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock\u2019s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund\u2019s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock\u2019s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock\u2019s performance.\nMany competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors\u2019 products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nIncreased competition may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe investment management industry is highly competitive and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and\nremain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure to maintain Aladdin\u2019s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock\u2019s productivity and growth.\nThe sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock\u2019s competitive success. Aladdin\u2019s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin\u2019s competitive position and may cause the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin.\nBlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.\nBlackRock\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with a focus on environmental, social and governance matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. Any failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock\u2019s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nChanges in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.\nAt December 31, 2020, BlackRock\u2019s net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.9 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock\u2019s earnings and cause earnings to decline.\nBlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.\nBlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client\u2019s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower\u2019s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $270 billion. In the Company\u2019s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $289 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2020. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nWhile not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock\u2019s ability to support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company\u2019s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nIncreased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock\u2019s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nGeopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock\u2019s control, including natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company\u2019s products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock\u2019s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence.\nRisks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\nPoor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:\n\u2022\nclient withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;\n\u2022\nclient shifts to products that charge lower fees;\n\u2022\nthe diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;\n\u2022\nreduced, minimal or no performance fees;\n\u2022\nan impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n\u2022\na decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.\nPerformance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.\nA portion of BlackRock\u2019s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $1.1 billion, or 7%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company\u2019s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company\u2019s performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.\nFailure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.\nBlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock\u2019s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock\u2019s business and reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s business, including its operations and financial condition, and may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.\nTowards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock\u2019s business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:\n\u2022\nreduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock\u2019s investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;\n\u2022\nlower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock\u2019s ability to generate performance fees;\n\u2022\nreduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;\n\u2022\na decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;\n\u2022\nnegative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock\u2019s clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whom it does business;\n\u2022\nthe negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock\u2019s other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that prolonged periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues may cause members of BlackRock\u2019s workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues arising from human error and/or individual attempts to circumvent controls due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption to BlackRock\u2019s workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of its remote work environment (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.\nThe aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect BlackRock\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock\u2019s products, clients, vendors and employees and may exacerbate the other risks described herein.\nTECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nA failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock\u2019s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation and cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock\u2019s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock\u2019s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock\u2019s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock\u2019s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth.\nIn addition, despite BlackRock\u2019s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company\u2019s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company\u2019s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.\nA cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock\u2019s use of process automation, as well as the increased use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock\u2019s control. BlackRock\u2019s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock\u2019s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.\nThere have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock\u2019s operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock\u2019s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company\u2019s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock\u2019s systems.\nIn addition, due to BlackRock\u2019s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.\nAny information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock\u2019s productivity and growth.\nBlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. For example, Aladdin\u2019s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin\u2019s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin\u2019s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures, and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin\u2019s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin\u2019s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock\u2019s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.\nContinuing enhancements to Aladdin\u2019s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin\u2019s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.\nThe operation of BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin\u2019s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nIn addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client\u2019s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.\nFailure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.\nBlackRock\u2019s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock\u2019s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.\nOperating risks associated with BlackRock\u2019s securities lending program may result in client losses.\nBlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock\u2019s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company\u2019s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.\nInorganic transactions may harm the Company\u2019s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.\nBlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into\nstrategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions. The success of BlackRock\u2019s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock\u2019s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock\u2019s control. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company\u2019s competitive position in the investment management industry.\nClient investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.\nBlackRock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:\n\u2022\nconstruction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;\n\u2022\naccidents, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock\u2019s control;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with global climate change, including the greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\npersonal injury or property damage;\n\u2022\nfailures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;\n\u2022\nexposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;\n\u2022\nchanges to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;\n\u2022\nthe financial resources of tenants; and\n\u2022\ncontingent liabilities on disposition of assets.\nThe above risks may expose BlackRock\u2019s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock\u2019s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock\u2019s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management\u2019s attention away from BlackRock\u2019s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nOperating in international markets increases BlackRock\u2019s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.\nAs a result of BlackRock\u2019s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. Operating outside the United States (\u201cUS\u201d) may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock\u2019s business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company\u2019s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL\nThe potential for human error in connection with BlackRock\u2019s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company\u2019s reputation and may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nMany of BlackRock\u2019s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock\u2019s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nFraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings, both of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company\u2019s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock\u2019s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company\u2019s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.\nIn addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company\u2019s share price. As such, if BlackRock\u2019s share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.\nRisks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships\nThe impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock\u2019s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock\u2019s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock maintains a robust vendor management program and regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nThe failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices, technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients\u2019 investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock\u2019s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock\u2019s arrangement with a\nvendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.\nBlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients\u2019 investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAny disruption to the Company\u2019s distribution channels may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock\u2019s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company\u2019s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company\u2019s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.\nKey technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.\nIn April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. The benefits of a cloud-based platform are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategy; however the partnership also introduces new risks, including: (i) risks associated with relying on a third-party for aspects of the reliability and stability of Aladdin\u2019s infrastructure; (ii) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (iii) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (iv) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nDisruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock\u2019s Exchange-Traded Fund (\u201cETF\u201d) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.\nBlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF\u2019s most recent net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF\u2019s holdings. The trading price of the ETF\u2019s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF\u2019s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF\u2019s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the accelerating growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with the growing demand for product customization. Although certain structural improvements have contributed to the increasing resilience, stability and transparency of ETF markets, including during periods of volatility, and despite BlackRock\u2019s continuing work with regulators and other third parties to implement additional ETF reforms, there can be no assurance that any such reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF\u2019s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nLegal, Regulatory and reputationAL Risks\nBlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.\nBlackRock\u2019s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock\u2019s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock\u2019s legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the EU and for personal data exported outside the EU. BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or\nsanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company\u2019s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.\nBlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BlackRock\u2019s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation or business and may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation.\nRegulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.\nIn recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see Item 1, Business - Regulation, key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:\n\u2022\nDesignation as a systemically important financial institution (\u201cSIFI\u201d): The Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.\n\u2022\nFederal Trade Commission Proposal: In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\u201cHSR\u201d) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock\u2019s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds\u2019 ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock\u2019s aggregate position in certain issuers.\n\u2022\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives; (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (iii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock\u2019s regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock\u2019s growth.\n\u2022\nStandards of Conduct Rulemaking: In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package included new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock\u2019s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock\u2019s distribution partners and limit BlackRock\u2019s ability to provide certain other services to its clients.\n\u2022\nMoney Market Reform: Following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets. Although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.\nRegulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company\u2019s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock\u2019s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.\nInternational regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.\nBlackRock\u2019s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:\n\u2022\nBritish Exit from the EU: On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an \u201cEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d was agreed to in connection with the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock\u2019s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company\u2019s growth or impact its financial performance.\n\u2022\nUK Overseas Funds Regime: As part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock\u2019s cross-border business model.\n\u2022\nEnhanced regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers to financial services firms: There has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (\u201cDORA\u201d), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock\u2019s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.\n\u2022\nMacroprudential policies for asset managers: Certain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock\u2019s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.\n\u2022\nRevised capital requirements for investment firms: In December 2017, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.\n\u2022\nEU market access: In 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (\u201cUCITS\u201d), BlackRock\u2019s ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSenior Managers and Certification Regime: In the UK, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (\u201cSMCR\u201d) to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.\n\u2022\nUK asset management market study: The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer \u201cvalue\u201d to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If \u201cvalue\u201d has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA\u2019s final report identified a number of competition\nissues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA\u2019s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.\n\u2022\nSustainability Regulation: In 2018, the EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.\n\u2022\nSecurities Financing Transaction Regulation (\u201cSFTR\u201d): In November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock\u2019s securities financing transaction activities.\n\u2022\nCentral Securities Depository Regulation: A settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.\nInternational regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company\u2019s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock\u2019s internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.\nLegal proceedings may cause the Company\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock\u2019s activities. Certain of BlackRock\u2019s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock\u2019s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock\u2019s shareholders, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.\nIn addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.\nDamage to BlackRock\u2019s reputation may harm its business.\nBlackRock\u2019s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock\u2019s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory or enforcement actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, cyber-security or other privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, a failure to manage environmental, social, and governance risks, or a failure to manage conflicts of interest. In addition, BlackRock\u2019s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for BlackRock in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock\u2019s reputation may impact BlackRock\u2019s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nA failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAs a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that\nactual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock\u2019s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock\u2019s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nBlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.\nBlackRock\u2019s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock\u2019s trust bank. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.\nThe implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock\u2019s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nOf note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nMoreover, as BlackRock\u2019s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds\u2019 benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities.\nBlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.\nAs a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation, among other things. In the US, the FTC during 2018 held hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, which included a discussion of common ownership, and in 2020, common ownership was cited as a disqualifying factor in a newly proposed exemption from the FTC\u2019s pre-merger notification rules. Common ownership was also cited as a consideration underlying the FTC\u2019s consultation on the rules that apply to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. Although the FTC acknowledged that the common ownership debate remains unsettled, it is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in connection with FTC rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers. In the EU, both the EC and the European Parliament released reports in 2020 on common ownership. Neither report took a position that common ownership had an adverse impact on competition. It is expected that common ownership will continue to be a focus for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. There is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors. This may, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.\nNew tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock\u2019s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.\nBlackRock\u2019s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (\u201cFTT\u201d) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s financial results and clients\u2019 performance results.\nThe application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock\u2019s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.", "PERMNO": 87267, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "BLK"}
