{"cik": "1014111", "company": "IMATION CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the products, technologies and businesses in which we invest and if we focus on products, technologies or business that do not perform in line with our strategic expectations or if market conditions change, our financial results could be adversely impacted. In February 2011 we announced our transformation strategy, which includes improving gross margins, exiting low margin products, introducing new products in secure and scalable storage, and organic and inorganic growth. In October 2012, we announced the acceleration of our transformation by reorganizing our businesses into two channel-focused business segments, and increasing our focus on data storage and data security. In August 2015, we formed a Strategic Alternatives Committee of our Board and, in October 2015, announced that the Strategic Alternatives Committee would work with management to make recommendations to the Board regarding our use of excess capital. Specifically, the Strategic Alternatives Committee will examine acquisition opportunities and develop initiatives for strategic value creation which may include opportunities outside of industries that comprised the Company's historical focus. If we are not successful in implementing these strategies or if market conditions change adversely for our chosen products or technologies, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe future revenue growth of our business depends in part on the development and performance of our new products. We have experienced revenue declines over the prior year in 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $200.3 million or 27.5 percent, $131.3 million or 15.3 percent and $145.9 million or 14.5 percent, respectively. Historically, magnetic and optical products have provided the majority of our revenues. The overall market for these products has been impacted by industry wide dynamics, including competing formats as well as continuing improvements in compression and deduplication technologies and as such, we have decided to aggressively wind down our legacy business. If we are not successful in growing new product revenues from our acquisitions of Nexsan and Connected Data, Inc., our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur participation in any future joint investment could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition and disputes between us and our partners. We may in the future make acquisitions of partial ownership interests in businesses or otherwise acquire businesses jointly or establish joint ventures with third parties. In such circumstances, we may not be in a position to exercise significant decision-making authority regarding a target business, partnership or other entity if we do not own a substantial majority of the equity interests of the target. These investments may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become insolvent or fail to fund their shares of required capital contributions. In addition, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such partners, some of which may possess more industry or technical knowledge or have better access to capital and other resources, may also seek similar acquisition targets as us and we may be in competition with them for such business combination targets. Disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our costs and expenses and divert a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time and effort away from our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners might result in subjecting assets owned by the partnership to additional risk. We may also, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our third-party partners. For example, in the future, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a partnership or other entity. Such a guarantee may be on a joint and several basis with our partner, in which case, we may be liable in the event such partner defaults on its guarantee obligation.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition. As part of our strategic plan to use excess capital, including through acquisitions, we may acquire interests in a number of different businesses, some of which may be outside of industries that have comprised our historical focus. We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire businesses or make acquisitions, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the business or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced. Although we intend to conduct extensive business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such businesses or acquisitions, especially if we are unfamiliar with the relevant industry. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the businesses or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nliquidity. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted depending on the specific risks applicable to any business or company we acquire and our ability to address those risks.\nWe could consume resources in researching acquisitions, business opportunities or financings and capital market transactions that are not ultimately consummated, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or invest in another business. We anticipate that the investigation of each specific acquisition or business opportunity and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments with respect to such transaction will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for financial advisors, accountants, attorneys and other advisors. If a decision is made not to consummate a specific acquisition, business opportunity or financing and capital market transaction, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, investment target or financing, we may fail to consummate the investment or acquisition for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event could consume significant management time and result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to consummate other acquisitions and investments.\nWe may engage in business combinations that are dilutive to existing shareholders, result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise harm our results of operations, and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses. We use financial assumptions and forecasts to determine the negotiated price we are willing to pay for an acquisition. If those financial assumptions and/or forecasts are not accurate, the price we pay may be too high, resulting in an inefficient use of cash and future goodwill impairment.\nNo assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially harm our business and operating results. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that such products will be successful after the closing and will not cannibalize sales of our existing products, that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such company. Failed business combinations, or the efforts to create a business combination, can also result in litigation.\nAcquisitions may require capital infusions, typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies. We may experience delays in the timing and successful integration of acquired technologies and product development, unanticipated costs and expenditures, changing relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic partners, or contractual, intellectual property or employment issues. In addition, key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us. The acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also result in our entering into a business market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation, subject us to an increased risk of intellectual property and other litigation and increase our expenses. These challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases, and we cannot ensure that we will realize the intended benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges, amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause of the rapid technology changes in our industry, we may not be able to compete if we cannot quickly develop, source, introduce and deliver differentiated and innovative products. We operate in a highly competitive environment against competitors who are both larger and smaller than us in terms of resources and market share. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions. In these highly competitive and changing markets, our success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products cost-effectively and on a timely basis. The success of our offerings is dependent on several factors including our differentiation from competitive offerings, timing of new product introductions, effectiveness of marketing programs and maintaining low sourcing and supply chain costs. No assurance can be given with regard to our ability to anticipate and react to changes in market requirements, actions of competitors or the pace and direction of technology changes.\nWe may be dependent on third parties for new product introductions or technologies in order to introduce our own new products. We are dependent in some cases upon various third parties for the introduction and acceptance of new products, the timing of which is not entirely in our control. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that we will maintain existing relationships or forge new OEM relationships. There can also be no assurance that we will continue to have access to proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties, or that we will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products. If we are not successful in obtaining rights to use competitive technologies, we may become less competitive in certain markets.\nIf we do not successfully implement restructuring plans and realize the benefits expected from the restructuring, our financial results will be affected. From time to time we have initiated restructuring programs related to our business strategy to, among other things, reduce operating expenses and address product line rationalization and infrastructure. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully implement these plans. If we are unable to restructure our operations successfully as needed, or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings expected to result from the restructuring, may not be met. If difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are otherwise not realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to economic risks including risk of foreign currency fluctuations and negative or uncertain global or regional economic conditions any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61 percent of our 2015 revenue derived from operations outside of the United States. Our international operations may be subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations, including political and economic instability, terrorist activity, the possibility of expropriation, trade tariffs or embargoes, unfavorable tax laws, restrictions on royalties, dividend and currency remittances, changes in foreign laws and regulations, requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers' councils. In addition, our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand in our non-U.S. operations and export markets. Additionally, some of our international suppliers pay us quarterly or annual rebates based on the amount of purchases we make from them. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. Likewise, our suppliers may face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses. Foreign currency fluctuations can also affect reported profits of our non-U.S. operations where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. A recession in any of the regions we serve might affect product demand and cause fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates, including exchange rate volatility in the Euro and the Japanese Yen, may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars. Given that the majority of our revenues are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe use third-party contract manufacturing services and supplier-provided parts, components, and sub-systems in our businesses and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. Our reliance on suppliers and third-party contract manufacturing to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the price and availability of these materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third-party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third-party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Additionally, we may experience changes in the supply and cost of raw materials and key components of our products resulting from the effects of natural disasters. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. No assurances can be given that acceptable cost levels will continue in the future. In addition, some critical raw materials and key components have a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot obtain those raw materials or critical components from the suppliers, we will not be able to produce certain products.\nAny potential acquisition or investment in a foreign business or a company with significant foreign operations may subject us to additional risks. Acquisitions or investments by us in a foreign business or other companies with significant foreign operations subject us to risks inherent in business operations outside of the United States. These risks include, for example, currency fluctuations, complex foreign regulatory regimes, punitive\ntariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders, restrictions on the movement of funds across national borders and cultural and language differences. If realized, some of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may incur asset impairment charges for intangible assets and goodwill in the future. We evaluate assets on our balance sheet, including such intangible assets and goodwill, annually as of November 30th or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor factors or indicators, such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows, established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries that would require an impairment test. The test for impairment of intangible assets requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. The test for impairment of goodwill requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit for which goodwill is assigned with the fair value of the reporting unit calculated based on discounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value a second step is performed to calculate any impairment.\nOur security products must provide appropriate levels of security to adequately store and protect our customers' data. Many of our secure storage products include software and hardware security such as user authentication, data encryption, and portable digital identities which are designed to prevent digital security breaches. Third parties may attempt to hack into our products in order to, among other things, compromise the integrity of those products or obtain confidential information. If our products do not provide adequate security and that security is compromised, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience increases in operating expenses, become subject to litigation and loss of reputation or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our efforts to upgrade the security of our products or develop new products to keep pace with continuing changes in technology will be successful or that product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of our secure storage products could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe loss of a major customer, partner, or reseller would adversely affect us. Our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers, partners, and resellers, some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence. We depend on the sales of our major customers, partners, and resellers and any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from these groups would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Developments adverse to our major customers, partners, and resellers or their products, or the failure of these groups to pay for components or services, would also have an adverse effect on us.\nChanges in European law or practice related to the imposition or collectability of optical levies could adversely affect us. Many European countries impose levies on imports of optical products and other products to compensate copyright owners for legal private copying. Imation is involved in litigation in several of those countries related to its obligation to pay levies on sales of our products to commercial channel customers. Based on current European law, we no longer pay levies on commercial channel sales. Because we have previously paid levies on such sales, we have offset certain levies payable on sales in the consumer channel with amounts previously overpaid with respect to commercial channel sales. If a court were to rule against us on this issue, we may be required to pay all, or a portion of, our unpaid levies to the collecting societies. In addition, any reduction in the current levy rates applicable to consumer channel sales could reduce our ability to offset for past overpayments on commercial channel sales. Other changes in levy rates or structures could impact our ability to compete in certain markets or otherwise reduce our profitability.\nIn a volatile global economic environment, demand and seasonality may result in our inability to accurately forecast our product purchase requirements. Sales of some of our products are subject to seasonality. For example, sales have typically increased in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, sometimes followed by significant declines in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. This seasonality makes it more difficult for us to forecast our business, especially in the volatile current global economic environment and its corresponding change in consumer confidence, which may impact typical seasonal trends. If our forecasts are inaccurate, we may lose market share due to product shortages or procure excess inventory or inappropriately increase or decrease our operating expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. This seasonality also may lead to the need for working capital investments in receivables and inventory and our need to build inventory levels in advance of our most active selling seasons. The seasonality of our products could change as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could affect our future earnings, equity and pension funding requirements. Pension obligations and related costs are determined using actual investment results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. Our funding requirements are based on these assumptions in addition to the performance of assets in the pension plans. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate, are largely outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings, equity and funding requirements.\nOur results of operations include our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to changes in tax laws and regulations, and to inspection by various tax authorities. Changes in tax guidance and related interpretations as well as inspections by tax authorities could materially impact our tax receivables and payables and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. Investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded. While we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional issues will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of such proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights and to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims of others. Claims may arise from time to time alleging that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in defending ourselves against those claims, we could incur substantial costs in implementing remediation actions, such as redesigning our products or processes, paying for license rights or paying to settle disputes. The related costs or the disruption to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nIn addition, we utilize valuable non-patented technical know-how and trade secrets in our product development. There can be no assurance that confidentiality agreements and other measures we utilize to protect such proprietary information will be effective, that these agreements will not be breached or that our competitors will not acquire the information as a result of or through independent development. We enforce our intellectual property rights against others who infringe those rights.\nAdditionally, our audio and data storage product categories are subject to allegations of patent infringement by our competitors as well as by non-practicing entities (NPEs), sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d who may seek monetary settlements from us.\nSignificant litigation matters could result in large costs. We are subject to various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business, especially regarding patents related to our audio and data storage products. We are often indemnified by our suppliers; litigation, however, is always subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable. We use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but we have found there is a strong tendency toward litigation in the patent area in our industry and this litigation environment poses a business risk. We cannot ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or financial impact that may be incurred by us in litigation.\nChanges in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing. Without such financing we may be unable to achieve our objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth. Disruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. While we have been able to achieve our past acquisitions through operating cash flows and without permanently borrowing on our outstanding credit facilities, the need may arise to obtain additional funding, in particular as we focus on exploring acquisition opportunities as part of our strategic plan to use excess capital. Based on our current plan of operations we believe our cash will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months; however there is no assurance that circumstances will not change, or that we may require additional capital to fund acquisitions or the operating expenses of acquired businesses.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain employees and key talent our business and financial results may be materially impacted. We operate in a highly competitive market for employees with specialized skill, experience and industry knowledge. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain employees and key talent. A failure to attract and retain key personnel could also have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanging laws and regulations have resulted in increased compliance costs for us, which could affect our operating results. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and\npublic disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, regulations regarding conflict minerals and newly enacted SEC regulations have created additional compliance requirements. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources as necessary to comply with evolving standards which may result in increased expenses. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect the production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials and fuel could impact our business and financial results.\nWe rely on our aging information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breach by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. Any interruption or failure of our information systems or any breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe announcement of our review of strategic alternatives and our strategic plan to explore acquisition opportunities could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from this review or plan. In August 2015, we formed a Strategic Alternatives Committee of our Board and, in October 2015, announced that the Strategic Alternatives Committee would work with management to make recommendations to the Board regarding our use of excess capital. Specifically, the Strategic Alternatives Committee will examine acquisition opportunities and develop initiatives for strategic value creation which may include opportunities outside of industries that comprise the Company's historical focus. There can be no assurance that our strategic plan will result in any transaction or any change to our overall structure or our business model, or that any transaction or change will enhance shareholder value or the value of any of our business units. Any transaction that is identified and pursued would be dependent on factors that may be beyond our control, including, among others, global economic conditions, the market environment, the possible requirement for shareholder approval of the transaction, the interest of third parties in the Company or our businesses and the availability of financing on reasonable terms or at all. We do not intend to provide updates or make any comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives unless our Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or management otherwise deems disclosure appropriate. We expect to incur expenses associated with identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives. In addition, the process of reviewing strategic alternatives and implementing any course of action ultimately selected may be disruptive to the Company\u2019s business operations, may distract the Company\u2019s management team from their day-to-day responsibilities and could make it more difficult to retain customers, vendors and employees. Any of these risks or uncertainties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company may face risks associated with the transition of its Board of Directors. Shareholders elected three new directors to the Company's Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 20, 2015, replacing three incumbent directors who had been nominated by the Company for reelection. Thereafter, the remaining directors resigned and four new individuals were appointed to the Board of Directors. Following this change, many aspects of the Company's strategies, structure and operating practices have been and will continue to be under review by the Board of Directors and will be subject to change. There can be no assurance that any changes on strategies, structure or operating practices resulting from this review will be successfully implemented or result in an increase in the Company's stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile. The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Any of the factors discussed above or such as the following may affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of sales of our existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence;\n\u2022\nnew products introduced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nperiods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry consolidation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the consumer electronics and data storage industries;\n\u2022\ncontraction in our operating results or growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of activist investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts relating specifically to us or the industries in which we participate in general; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally.\nIn addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.\nIf we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, the NYSE may delist our common shares, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOn February 2, 2016, the Company received written notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from NYSE Regulation, Inc. that the Company fell below the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). The Notice indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because its average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50 million, and its stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million. The Company has already notified the NYSE that, in accordance with applicable NYSE rules, it intends to submit a plan within 45 days from the Company\u2019s receipt of the Notice to cure the deficiency and return to compliance with NYSE continued listing requirements. The plan will advise the NYSE of definitive action the Company has taken, or is taking, that would bring it into conformity with market capitalization listing standards within 18 months of receipt of the Notice. The NYSE will review the plan and, within 45 days of its receipt, determine whether the Company has made a reasonable demonstration of an ability to conform to the relevant standards in the 18 month period. If the NYSE accepts the plan, the Company\u2019s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 18 month cure period, subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with other continued listing standards, and the Company will be subject to quarterly monitoring by the NYSE for compliance with the plan. If the NYSE does not accept the plan, the Company\u2019s common stock would be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings.\nOn February 16th, 2016, we received a letter from the NYSE notifying us that, for 30 consecutive trading days, the average closing price for our common shares was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the NYSE under Item 802.01C of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual. The notice does not have an immediate effect on the listing of our common shares, and our common shares will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cIMN.\u201d It is also standard for the NYSE to automatically de-list any stock that has any trade (even intra-day) below $0.15 per share. As of February 29, 2016, our common shares closed at a price of $0.861 per share. We have 180 days, or until August 14, 2016, to regain compliance with the NYSE\u2019s $1.00 minimum share price requirement. We can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period our common shares have a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of such month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we determine that we must cure the price condition by taking an action that will require approval of our shareholders, we may also regain compliance by: (i) obtaining the requisite shareholder approval by no later than our next annual meeting, (ii) implementing the action promptly thereafter and (iii) the price of our common shares promptly exceeding $1.00 per share, and the price remaining above that level for at least the following 30 trading days.\nA delisting of our common shares from the NYSE would negatively impact us because it would: (i) reduce the liquidity and market price of our common shares; (ii) reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common shares, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limit our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradeable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets, and (iv) impair our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nThe success of our strategic alternatives business strategy is dependent in part on our ability to attract and retain talented personnel. As we explore strategic alternatives to deploy our excess capital, the success of our business strategy will depend in part on the abilities and expertise of our management and other personnel in interpreting and responding to economic, market and other conditions and data in order to, among other things, locate and adopt appropriate opportunities and acquire, monitor and divest businesses and investments. The loss of, or inability to attract, talented individuals to execute our strategic alternatives business strategy could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe implementation of a new accounting system for most of our subsidiaries could interfere with our business and operations. We are in the process of implementing a new accounting system, NetSuite, for all of our subsidiaries except for Nexsan. The implementation of new systems and enhancements may be disruptive to our business and can be time-consuming and divert management\u2019s attention. Any disruptions relating to our systems or any problems with the implementation, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period, could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nDecreasing revenues and greater losses in our Nexsan product line may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and capital resources. For the last three fiscal years the revenues attributable to the Nexsan product line have declined and losses have been significant. As Nexsan is expected to be our go forward business, any further material declines in revenues or increased losses could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we are unable to grow revenue, increase profit margins or cut costs, our capital resources may be negatively impacted.\nClinton Group\u2019s investment of some of our excess cash may not be successful and may result in losses.
