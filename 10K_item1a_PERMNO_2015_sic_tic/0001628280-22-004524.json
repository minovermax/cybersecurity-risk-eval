{"cik": "4447", "company": "HESS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.\nMarket and Third-Party Risks\nOur business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas, political conditions and events (including weather, instability, changes in governments, armed conflict, economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, NGL and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors, including COVID-19, may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Average benchmark prices for 2021 were $68.08 per barrel for WTI (2020: $39.34; 2019: $57.04) and $70.95 per barrel for Brent (2020: $43.21; 2019: $64.16). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. Furthermore, from time to time we have entered into, and may in the future enter into or modify, commodity price hedging arrangements to manage commodity price volatility. These arrangements may limit potential upside from commodity price increases, or expose us to additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk, which could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other similar public health developments and related changes to demand for oil and natural gas. Since 2020, COVID-19 and related actions taken by governments and businesses, including voluntary and mandatory quarantines and travel and other restrictions, have significantly impacted economic activity. As a result of COVID-19, our operations, and those of our business partners, service companies and suppliers, have experienced and may continue to experience further adverse effects, including but not limited to: disruptions, delays or temporary suspensions of operations, including shut-ins of production; temporary inaccessibility or closures of facilities; supply chain issues; and workforce impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures. We have implemented a variety of health and safety measures, including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices, such as travel restrictions, health screenings, vaccination policies, reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites, wherever such reduction can be done safely, and remote working arrangements for office workers. There is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and its variants, including the risk of infection of key employees, and our ability to perform certain functions could be impaired by these new business practices. For example, our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to our use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices, which could make us more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. To the extent we or our business partners, service companies or suppliers continue to experience restrictions or other effects, our financial condition, results of operations and future expansion projects may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the global health concerns, COVID-19 negatively affected the U.S. and global economy and the demand for oil and natural gas. The prolonged continuation or amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 could result in further economic downturn that may affect our operating results in the long-term. Furthermore, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding the global spread of its variants negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. Containment measures implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants could continue to be widespread and lead to sustained adoption of certain behavioral changes, such as reduced travel and enhanced work-from-home policies, which could result in further reductions in demand for and consumption of energy commodities. A reduction in consumer demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL could require further curtailments and shut-ins of production by the industry and further increase the costs of commercial storage and midstream contracts.\nThe timeline and potential magnitude of COVID-19 remains unknown and will depend on future developments, including, among others, the global availability of vaccines, the efficacy of vaccines against variants and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume. In the event one or more of our business partners is adversely affected by COVID-19 or the current market environment, that may impact our costs and ability to conduct business with them. In addition, we may face an increased risk of changes in the regulation related to our business resulting from COVID-19, such as the imposition of limitations on our workforce's ability to access our facilities. We also are subject to litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements. We may experience decreases in production and\nproved reserves, additional asset impairments, and other accounting charges if demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL decreases. A sustained extension of the current market environment may make it more difficult to comply with covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt, and a lack of confidence in our industry on the part of the financial markets may result in a lack of access to capital, any of which could lead to reduced liquidity.\nAs the impact from COVID-19 remains difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain. Any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control.\nWe do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. For example, in June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to us and other predecessors in title of certain of its assets, who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, actions of our contractual counterparties may adversely affect the value of our investments and result in increased costs or liabilities.\nOur industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future, could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets, which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nIf we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition, replacing reserves and developing future production are also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce capital available for our exploration and development activities, render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion, and result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns.\nThere are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined in 2020 and 2019, relative to comparative periods, resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. In contrast, crude oil prices improved in 2021, relative to the preceding year, resulting in increases to our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2022 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2021, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCatastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including catastrophic events, which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations, result in personal injury\nand have other significant adverse effects. These events include unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations, equipment malfunctions or failures, derailments, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, hurricanes, severe weather, geological events, shortages in availability of skilled labor, cyber-attacks or health measures related to COVID-19. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. For example, we are self-insured against physical damage to property and liability related to windstorms. In 2021 and 2020, hurricane-related downtime reduced net production by 4,000 boepd and 8,000 boepd, respectively, and hurricane related maintenance and repair costs were approximately $7 million in both 2021 and 2020. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. In addition, the frequency and severity of weather conditions which impact our business activities may also be impacted by the effects of climate change. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate change. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions, equipment failures, and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.\nAn inability to secure personnel, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost, including as a result of changes to our industry due to COVID-19, which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. In addition, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. An inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business.\nDisruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration, development and production activities and the activities of our business partners. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices in response to COVID-19. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, any such disruption, failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy.\nWe engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.\nThe alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs. Certain borrowings on our credit facilities may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures are expected to cause LIBOR to be discontinued after June 30, 2023 or to perform differently than in the past. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has proposed SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR. At this time, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings.\nRegulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations, solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties.\nConcerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.\nClimate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of GHGs from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of GHGs.\nWe are prioritizing sustainable energy practices to further reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time remaining a successful operating public company. However, various key stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others, may have differing approaches to climate change initiatives. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholders' trust and thereby affect our reputation. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives\nto reduce the use of petroleum fuels, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent GHG emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. Shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry, and stockholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require us to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.\nWe are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Political or regulatory developments and governmental actions, including federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted, which may affect our financial results. These actions could result in tax increases retroactively through tax claims or prospectively through changes to applicable statutory tax rates, modification of the tax base, or imposition of new tax types. Additionally, governmental actions could include post-production deductions from royalty payments; limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new oil and gas leases or extensions on existing oil and gas leases; adverse court decisions with respect to the sale of new and existing oil and gas leases; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; the imposition of tariffs; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. In recent years, proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm. Costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability and civil unrest in North Africa, South America and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. Political instability exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general.\nOne of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Hess Midstream LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our stockholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs.", "PERMNO": 28484, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HES"}
