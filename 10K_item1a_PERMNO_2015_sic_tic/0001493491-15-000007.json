{"cik": "1493491", "company": "Heritage Financial Group Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could impact our business, financial results, and results of operations. Investing in our common stock involves risks, including those described below. These risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our common stock when evaluating the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly the forward-looking statements). These risk factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. If any of the events in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are immaterial do materialize, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks.\nOur expansion efforts, particularly through new and acquired branches, may not be successful if we fail to manage our growth effectively.\nA key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand our branch network into communities within or adjacent to Georgia, Florida and Alabama markets in which we currently conduct business. Operating branches outside of our original southwest Georgia market and beyond our current market areas may subject us to additional risk, including the local risks related to the new market areas, management of employees from a distance, additional credit risks, logistical operational issues and management time constraints.\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities, and, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch network will be profitable. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur major expansion efforts into the mortgage business may not be successful if we fail to manage our growth effectively.\nKey components of our strategy to grow the mortgage business include significantly growing our mortgage origination volume and selling loans directly to the GSEs. Our agreements with investors to sell our loans generally contain covenants that require us to repurchase loans under certain circumstances, including some delinquencies, or to return premiums paid by those investors if the loans are paid off early. If we are required to repurchase sold loans under these covenants, they may be deemed troubled loans, with the potential for charge-offs and/or loss provision changes, which could impact our earnings and asset quality ratios adversely. During 2014, we originated $1.0 billion in mortgage loans held for sale and we hold a mortgage repurchase reserve of $111,000 at December 31, 2014 which may not be enough to satisfy any future losses associated with the repurchase of loans we originated. Separately, we sold $643.5 million directly to the GSEs during 2014 which increases the risk of repurchase because we are held to a higher degree of internal quality assurance for underwriting compliance by the GSEs compared to other buyers of mortgage loans. We did not incur any losses in conjunction with these agreements in 2014. Our ability to sell loans on the secondary mortgage market is impacted by interest rate changes and investor demand or expected return. If this market becomes less liquid, we may not be able to rely as much on loan sales to reduce our interest rate and credit risk. In connection with the GSE sales, we are servicing such loans and at December 31, 2014 mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) of $5.7 million were recorded and could be subjected to impairment if prepayment speeds are faster than the anticipated speeds at the recording of the asset.\nWe have engaged in four FDIC-assisted transactions with two subject to loss-sharing agreements which could present additional risks to our financial condition and earnings.\nWe have engaged in four FDIC-assisted acquisitions with two subject to loss-sharing agreements. These acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks, even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. As is typical in the acquisition of a failed financial institution, many of the loans acquired in these acquisitions were non-performing and had poor documentation, including a lack of current financial information on borrowers and of current evidence of collateral value.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we held $50.7 million in non-covered FDIC-acquired assets and $57.9 million in covered FDIC-acquired assets at fair value, which includes a non-covered discount of $24.4 million and a covered discount of $31.4 million. These assets are carried on our books at fair value, based on an estimate of future cash flows, which we review and evaluate quarterly. We cannot assure that the asset discount will fully protect us from all future losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs of December 31, 2014, we held an FDIC loss-share receivable of $23.8 million associated with our loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. This receivable is periodically adjusted to reflect the present value of our expected losses reimbursed at 80% related to FDIC-assisted acquisitions covered under a loss-sharing agreement plus 80% of reimbursable expenses less recoveries. The receivable is adjusted for improvements in cash flow by reducing the receivable through negative accretion. Conversely, if losses are greater than anticipated, the receivable would be increased. We cannot assure that the receivable will not incur a future impairment related to the actual reimbursement from the FDIC or improvement in the collected cash flows for the covered assets. Additionally, loss-sharing agreements have limited terms. Therefore, the FDIC will not reimburse us for any charge-offs or related losses that we experience after the term of each loss-sharing agreement expires.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming all the risks associated with managing the problem loans acquired in connection with FDIC-assisted transactions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability. Moreover, the risk of managing the FDIC loss-share receivable adds increased volatility and risk to our earnings over the period of these loss sharing agreements.\nChanges in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher than anticipated loan charge-offs on assets acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions.\nThe fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio, and, consequently, reduce our net income, and may also increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolios that we have acquired in FDIC-assisted acquisitions and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nAlthough we have entered into two loss-share agreements with the FDIC providing that a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios acquired in connection with our two 2011 FDIC-assisted transactions will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss-share agreements have limited terms; therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss-sharing agreements will not be reimbursable by the FDIC and will negatively impact our net income.\nOur business may be affected adversely by credit risk associated with residential real estate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, residential real estate, including home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $221.7 million, or 20.4%, of total loans excluding acquired credit impaired loans. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Although residential real estate values have stabilized in our local housing markets, if residential values begin to fall again we are exposed to increased losses if borrowers default on their loans. Continued declines in both the volume of real estate sales and sales prices, coupled with high levels of unemployment, may result in higher loan delinquencies or problem assets, a decline in demand for our products and services or a decrease in our deposits. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, which would adversely affect our capital and liquidity and could damage our financial condition and business operations. These declines may have a greater impact on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions that have more diversified loan portfolios.\nWe are subject to credit risks in connection with the concentration of adjustable rate loans in our portfolio.\nAdjustable rate loans totaled $188.2 million, or 17.3%, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. Borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin. Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable-rate loans, increasing the possibility of default. Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably lower interest rates. In addition, declining housing prices may prevent refinancing or a sale of the home because borrowers may then have insufficient equity in their homes. These events, alone or in combination, may contribute to higher delinquency rates and negatively impact our earnings.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be negatively impacted.\nAt December 31, 2014, our nonperforming assets (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent, nonperforming troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed real estate assets) totaled $6.7 million. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or real estate owned. We must reserve for estimated credit losses, which are established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, if appropriate, we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncarrying costs including taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, potentially distracting them from the overall supervision of our operations and other income-producing activities.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. Management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products, and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additions to our allowance. Additions to our allowance decrease our net income. Our allowance for loan losses, excluding acquired credit impaired loans, was 1.26% of gross loans, excluding acquired credit impaired loans, and 165.0% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2014, compared to 1.31% of gross loans, excluding acquired credit impaired loans, and 94.9% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2013.\nOur regulators and external auditor periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review. These increases in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and at certain other times during the asset\u2019s holding period. Our net book value (\u201cNBV\u201d) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset\u2019s NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, the fair value of our investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our NBV in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. Additional material charge-offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our bank regulator periodically reviews our OREO and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs, as required by our regulator, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by decreases in interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. At December 31, 2014, the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale was $1.6 million compared to a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at December 31, 2013.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected significantly by changes in interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. Also, increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed-rate assets, which would limit the funds we have available to reinvest in higher-yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates. See the Item 7 -\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk.\nOur strategies to modify our interest rate risk profile may be difficult to implement.\nOur asset/liability management strategies are designed to decrease our interest rate risk sensitivity. One such strategy is increasing the amount of adjustable rate and/or short-term assets. We offer adjustable rate loan products as a means to achieve this strategy. The availability of lower rates on fixed-rate loans would generally create a decrease in borrower demand for adjustable rate assets. Additionally, these adjustable-rate assets may prepay. At December 31, 2014, 17.3% of our loan portfolio consisted of adjustable-rate loans, compared to 17.5% at December 31, 2013.\nWe also are managing our liabilities to moderate our interest rate risk sensitivity. Customer demand is primarily for short-term certificates of deposit. Using short-term liabilities to fund long-term, fixed-rate assets will increase the interest rate sensitivity of any financial institution. We are utilizing FHLB advances, brokered deposits and repurchase agreements to mitigate the impact of customer demand by lengthening the maturities of these advances or entering into longer term repurchase agreements, depending on liquidity or investment opportunities.\nFHLB advances, brokered deposits and repurchase agreements are entered into as liquidity is needed or to fund assets that provide for a spread considered sufficient by management. If we are unable to originate adjustable rate assets at favorable rates or fund loan originations or securities purchases with long-term advances or structured borrowings, we may have difficulty executing this asset/liability management strategy and/or it may result in a reduction in profitability.\nWe face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in many different financial service businesses and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems.\nA tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth, our earnings capability and capital levels negatively. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, including brokered deposits, as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings, especially from the FHLB and repurchase agreements, also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations, or continued deterioration in credit markets.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Should we be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or preferred stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to new stockholders would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, our financial performance, and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional common stock, as well as classes or series of preferred stock, generally without any action on the part of the stockholders. In addition, the board has the power, generally without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Maryland and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities, including our common stock. These provisions include: a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10% of total shares outstanding, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns more than 10% of our outstanding common stock; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors; and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings, a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our Board of Directors, supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors and the other provisions of our charter. Our charter also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. In addition, pursuant to federal and state laws and regulations, as a general matter, no person or company, acting individually or in concert with others, may acquire more than 10% of our common stock without prior approval from our regulators.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nThe voting limitation provision in our charter could limit your voting rights as a holder of our common stock.\nOur charter provides that any person or group who acquires beneficial ownership of our common stock in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares may not vote the excess shares. Accordingly, if you acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, your voting rights with respect to the common stock will not be commensurate with your economic interest in our company.\nWe currently hold a significant amount of bank-owned life insurance.\nAt December 31, 2014, we held $62.5 million of bank-owned life insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d) on key employees and executives, with a cash surrender value of $24.9 million. The policies are maintained to fund amounts owed under executive supplemental retirement plans. The eventual repayment of the cash surrender value is subject to the ability of the various insurance companies to pay death benefits or to return the cash surrender value to us if needed for liquidity purposes. We continually monitor the financial strength of the various companies with whom we carry these policies. However, any one of these companies could experience a decline in financial strength, which could impair its ability to pay benefits or return our cash surrender value. If we need to liquidate these policies for liquidity purposes, we would be subject to taxation on the increase in cash surrender value and penalties for early termination, both of which would adversely impact earnings.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income.\nThe Bank and the Company are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by federal and state regulators, which have extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndetermine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any change in these regulations and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations.\nIn response to the recent financial crisis, Congress took actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions, and the FDIC has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts. The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of the CFPB, which has broad authority to issue regulations governing the services and products we provide consumers. This additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely impact our operations. That legislation also contains provisions that, over time, could result in higher regulatory capital requirements and loan loss provisions for the Company and the Bank and may increase interest expense due to the ability to pay interest on all demand deposits. The potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards. See \u201cHow We Are Regulated.\u201d\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, securities brokers, and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our core deposits and interest earning assets.\nOur accounting policies and methods impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Application of these policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. These accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nOur controls and procedures may be ineffective.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls, and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. As a result, we may incur increased costs to maintain and improve our controls and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls or procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us.\nAlthough we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncustomer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nOur business operations rely on third party vendors, which provide services such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nImplementation of our stock-based incentive plan may dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were approximately 25,643 restricted shares and 71,147 stock options reserved for future awards under our two equity incentive plans. These stock-based incentive plans may be funded either through open market purchases or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of Heritage common stock. While our intention is to fund this plan through open market purchases, stockholders would experience approximately a 2.0% reduction in ownership interest in the event 96,790 newly issued shares of our common stock are issued upon exercise of stock options or issued as restricted stock under these plans.\nAdditional compensation and benefit expenses associated with the implementation of our stock-based incentive benefit plans will affect our profitability adversely.\nAs awards are granted under our two equity incentive plans, our non-interest expenses are likely to increase as we will recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses related to the shares granted to employees, executives and directors under these plans. We cannot predict the actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses because applicable accounting practices require that expenses be based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future; however, we expect them to be material. In addition, we will recognize expense for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants\u2019 accounts (i.e., as the loan used to acquire these shares is repaid), and we will recognize expense for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients.\nOur common stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. However, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of many larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers for our common stock at any given time. This presence is impacted by general economic and market conditions and investors\u2019 views of our Company. Because our trading volume is limited, any significant sale of our shares is subject to significant volatility in the price of our common stock.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Georgia and Maryland law, and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of Heritage without the consent of our Board of Directors. Stockholders may want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential acquiror could offer a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Heritage cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Heritage. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCombining with Renasant may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger with Renasant may not be realized.\nHeritage and Renasant have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Renasant\u2019s and our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Heritage and Renasant in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nAs with any Merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause Heritage and/or Renasant to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from Heritage and/or Renasant and move their business to competing financial institutions. The loss of key employees could also adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business and have an adverse effect on our financial results. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Heritage and Renasant during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company.\nAdditionally, the combined company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other synergies that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of each party to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. These circumstances could have an adverse effect on the Renasant's business, results of operation and stock price.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger with Renasant is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger with Renasant on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees by us may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement generally requires Heritage to operate its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice pending consummation of the Merger and also restricts us from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs without Renasant\u2019s consent. Such restrictions will be in place until either the Merger is consummated or the Merger Agreement is terminated. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our business may be adversely affected.\nA termination of the Merger Agreement prior to the closing could have negative consequences for Heritage. For example, our business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect an assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances involving consummation of a competing transaction, we may be required to pay Renasant a termination fee of $10,300,000 plus additional costs and expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with this Agreement up to $750,000. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the termination fee we may be required to pay, if any, under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nThe Merger may distract our company\u2019s management from its other responsibilities.\nThe Merger could cause the management of our company to focus its time and energies on matters related to the Merger that otherwise would be directed to its business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of our company\u2019s management, if significant, could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect the business and earnings of our company before the Merger, or the business and earnings of Renasant after the Merger.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA lawsuit has been filed against Heritage, members of our Board of Directors, and Renasant challenging the Merger. Any adverse judgment in such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from closing within the expected timeframe or at all.\nHeritage, the members of our Board of Directors, HeritageBank, Renasant and RenasantBank have been named as defendants in a pending purported class action lawsuit brought by an individual Heritage stockholder challenging the Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin Heritage and Renasant stockholders from voting on to approve the Merger at their respective special meetings of stockholders and to otherwise enjoin the Merger. One of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no law, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction is in effect prohibiting, restricting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the current and potential lawsuits referenced here and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying, or otherwise adversely affecting the defendants\u2019 ability to complete the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.", "PERMNO": 90730, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "HBOS"}
