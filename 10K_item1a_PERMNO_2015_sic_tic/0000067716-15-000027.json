{"cik": "67716", "company": "MDU RESOURCES GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company's business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and in other documents that it files with the SEC. The factors and the other matters discussed herein are important factors that could cause actual results or outcomes for the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this document.\nEconomic Risks\nThe Company's exploration and production and pipeline and energy services businesses are dependent on factors, including commodity prices and commodity price basis differentials, that are subject to various external influences that cannot be controlled.\nThese factors include: fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas production and prices; fluctuations in commodity price basis differentials; domestic and foreign supplies of oil, NGL and natural gas; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries; actions of the\n20 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K\nPart I\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; drilling successes in oil and natural gas operations; the timely receipt of necessary permits and approvals; the ability to retain employees to identify, drill for and develop reserves; utilizing appropriate technologies; irregularities in geological formations; and other risks incidental to the development and operations of oil and natural gas wells, processing plants and pipeline systems. Continued prolonged depressed prices for oil, NGL and natural gas could impede the growth of our pipeline and energy services business, and could negatively affect the results of operations, cash flows and asset values of the Company's exploration and production and pipeline and energy services businesses.\nActual quantities of recoverable oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and discounted future net cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from estimated amounts. There is a risk that changes in estimates of proved reserve quantities or other factors including low oil and natural gas prices, could result in future noncash write-downs of the Company's oil and natural gas properties.\nThe process of estimating oil, NGL and natural gas reserves is complex. Reserve estimates are based on assumptions relating to oil, NGL and natural gas pricing, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, timing of operations, and the percentage of interest owned by the Company in the properties. The proved reserve estimates are prepared for each of the Company's properties by internal engineers assigned to an asset team by geographic area. The internal engineers analyze available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each geographic area. The internal engineers make various assumptions regarding this data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. Although the Company has prepared its proved reserve estimates in accordance with guidelines established by the industry and the SEC, significant changes to the proved reserve estimates may occur based on actual results of production, drilling, costs and pricing.\nThe Company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and current costs in accordance with SEC requirements. Actual future prices and costs may be significantly different. Various factors, including lower SEC Defined Prices, market differentials, changes in estimates of proved reserve quantities, unsuccessful results of exploration and development efforts or changes in operating and development costs could result in future noncash write-downs of the Company's oil and natural gas properties.\nSEC Defined Prices for each quarter in 2014 were as follows:\nFor purposes of comparison, first-of-the-month prices were as follows:\nGiven the current oil and natural gas pricing environment, the Company believes it is likely it will have noncash write-downs of its oil and natural gas properties in future quarters until such time as commodity prices begin to recover.\nThe regulatory approval, permitting, construction, startup and/or operation of power generation facilities and Dakota Prairie Refinery may involve unanticipated events or delays that could negatively impact the Company's business and its results of operations and cash flows.\nThe construction, startup and operation of power generation facilities and Dakota Prairie Refinery involve many risks, which may include: delays; breakdown or failure of equipment; inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals; inability to complete financing; inability to negotiate acceptable equipment acquisition, construction, fuel and crude oil supply, off-take, transmission, transportation or other material agreements; changes in markets and market prices for power, crude oil and refined products; cost increases and overruns; as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. An additional risk for regulated projects would be the inability to obtain full cost recovery in regulated rates. Such unanticipated events could negatively impact the Company's business, its results of operations and cash flows.\nMDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 21\nPart I\nEconomic volatility affects the Company's operations, as well as the demand for its products and services and the value of its investments and investment returns including its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and may have a negative impact on the Company's future revenues and cash flows.\nThe global demand and price volatility for natural resources, interest rate changes, governmental budget constraints and the ongoing threat of terrorism can create volatility in the financial markets. Unfavorable economic conditions can negatively affect the level of public and private expenditures on projects and the timing of these projects which, in turn, can negatively affect the demand for the Company's products and services, primarily at the Company's construction businesses. The level of demand for construction products and services could be adversely impacted by the economic conditions in the industries the Company serves, as well as in the economy in general. State and federal budget issues may negatively affect the funding available for infrastructure spending. The ability of the Company's electric and natural gas distribution businesses to grow service territory and customer base is affected by the economic environments of the markets served. This economic volatility could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset values.\nChanging market conditions could negatively affect the market value of assets held in the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required funding contributions.\nThe Company relies on financing sources and capital markets. Access to these markets may be adversely affected by factors beyond the Company's control. If the Company is unable to obtain economic financing in the future, the Company's ability to execute its business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue acquisitions that the Company may otherwise rely on for future growth could be impaired. As a result, the market value of the Company's common stock may be adversely affected. If the Company issues a substantial amount of common stock it could have a dilutive effect on its existing shareholders.\nThe Company relies on access to short-term borrowings, including the issuance of commercial paper, long-term capital markets and asset sales as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by its cash flow from operations. If the Company is not able to access capital at competitive rates, the ability to implement its business plans may be adversely affected. Market disruptions or a downgrade of the Company's credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include:\n\u2022\nA severe prolonged economic downturn\n\u2022\nThe bankruptcy of unrelated industry leaders in the same line of business\n\u2022\nDeterioration in capital market conditions\n\u2022\nTurmoil in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nVolatility in commodity prices\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks\n\u2022\nCyber attacks\nEconomic turmoil, market disruptions and volatility in the securities trading markets, as well as other factors including changes in the Company's results of operations, financial position and prospects, may adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company currently has a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, under which the Company may issue and sell any combination of common stock and debt securities. The issuance of a substantial amount of the Company's common stock, whether sold pursuant to the registration statement, issued in connection with an acquisition or otherwise, or the perception that such an issuance could occur, may adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance by the Company's customers and counterparties.\nIf the Company's customers or counterparties were to experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, the Company could experience difficulty in collecting receivables. The nonpayment and/or nonperformance by the Company's customers and counterparties could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nThe backlogs at the Company's construction materials and contracting and construction services businesses are subject to delay or cancellation and may not be realized.\nBacklog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts. Contracts are subject to delay, default or cancellation and the contracts in the Company's backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the applicable contracts. Backlog may also be affected by project delays or cancellations resulting from\n22 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K\nPart I\nweather conditions, external market factors and economic factors beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will be realized.\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase costs of operations, impact or limit business plans, or expose the Company to environmental liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its operations, including air quality, water quality, waste management and other environmental considerations. These laws and regulations can increase capital, operating and other costs, cause delays as a result of litigation and administrative proceedings, and create compliance, remediation, containment, monitoring and reporting obligations, particularly relating to electric generation operations and oil and natural gas development and processing. These laws and regulations generally require the Company to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Although the Company strives to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, public and private entities and private individuals may interpret the Company's legal or regulatory requirements differently and seek injunctive relief or other remedies against the Company. The Company cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any such litigation or administrative proceedings.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to the Company. These laws and regulations could require the Company to limit the use or output of certain facilities, restrict the use of certain fuels, install pollution controls, remediate environmental contamination, remove or reduce environmental hazards, or prevent or limit the development of resources. Revised or additional laws and regulations that increase compliance costs or restrict operations, particularly if costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2011, the EPA finalized the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rules that will require reductions in mercury and other air emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. Montana-Dakota evaluated the pollution control technologies needed at its electric generation resources to comply with this rule and determined that the Lewis & Clark Station near Sidney, Montana, will require additional particulate matter control for non-mercury metal emissions. Montana-Dakota has further evaluated pollution control options and intends to comply with the rule by making scrubber modifications, including installation of a mist eliminator and sieve tray. Controls must be in place by April 16, 2015, or April 16, 2016, if a one-year extension is granted for completion of the pollution control project. Because a one-year extension is needed to install the pollution control project, Montana-Dakota submitted a timely request for approval of a one-year compliance extension to the Montana DEQ on November 24, 2014. On January 30, 2015, the Montana DEQ approved the one-year extension.\nOn August 15, 2014, the EPA published a final rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, establishing requirements for water intake structures at existing steam electric generating facilities. The purpose of the rule is to reduce impingement and entrainment of fish and other aquatic organisms at cooling water intake structures. The majority of the Company's electric generating facilities are either not subject to the rule requirements or have completed studies that project compliance expenditures are not material. The Lewis & Clark Station will complete a study by 2018 that will be used to determine any required controls. It is unknown at this time what controls are required or if compliance costs will be material. The installation schedule for any required controls would be established with the permitting agency after the study is completed.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important common practice used by Fidelity that involves injecting water, sand, a water-thickening agent called guar, and trace amounts of chemicals, under pressure, into rock formations to stimulate oil, NGL and natural gas production. Fidelity follows state regulations for well drilling and completion, including regulations for hydraulic fracturing and recovered fluids disposal. Fracturing fluid constituents are reported on state or national websites. The EPA is developing a study to review potential effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground sources of drinking water; the results of that study could impact future legislation or regulation. The BLM has released draft well stimulation regulations for hydraulic fracturing operations. If implemented, the BLM regulations would affect only Fidelity's operations on BLM-administered lands. If adopted as proposed, the BLM regulations, along with other legislative initiatives and regulatory studies, proceedings or initiatives at federal or state agencies that focus on the hydraulic fracturing process, could result in additional compliance, reporting and disclosure requirements. Future legislation or regulation could increase compliance and operating costs, as well as delay or inhibit the Company's ability to develop its oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published a final NSPS rule for the oil and natural gas industry. The NSPS rule phases in over two years. The first phase was effective October 15, 2012, and primarily covers natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. Under the new rule, gas vapors or emissions from the natural gas wells must be captured or combusted utilizing a high-efficiency device. Additional reporting requirements and control devices covering oil and natural gas production equipment were phased in for certain new oil and gas facilities\nMDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 23\nPart I\neffective January 2015. This new rule's impacts on Fidelity, WBI Energy Transmission and WBI Energy Midstream are not expected to be material and are likely to include implementing recordkeeping, reporting and testing requirements and purchasing and installing required equipment.\nInitiatives to reduce GHG emissions could adversely impact the Company's operations.\nConcern that GHG emissions are contributing to global climate change has led to international, federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. On June 25, 2013, President Obama released his Climate Action Plan for the U.S. in which he stated his goal to reduce GHG emissions \"in the range of 17 percent\" below 2005 levels by 2020. The president issued a memorandum to the EPA on the same day, instructing the EPA to re-propose the GHG NSPS rule for new electric generation units. The EPA released the re-proposed rule on January 8, 2014, in the Federal Register, which takes the place of the rule proposed in 2012 for new electric generation units that the EPA did not finalize. This rule applies to new fossil fuel-fired electric generation units, including coal-fired units, natural gas-fired combined-cycle units and natural gas-fired simple-cycle peaking units. The EPA's 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per MW hour emissions standard for coal-fired units does not allow any new coal-fired electric generation to be constructed unless carbon dioxide is captured and sequestered.\nPresident Obama also directed the EPA to develop a GHG NSPS standard for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation units by June 1, 2014, with finalization by June 1, 2015. On June 18, 2014, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and a separate proposed rule limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing units that are modified or reconstructed.\nIn the proposed rule for existing sources, the EPA requires carbon dioxide emission reductions from each state and instructs each state, or group of states that work together, to submit a plan to the EPA by June 30, 2016, that demonstrates how the state will achieve the targeted emission reductions by 2030. The state plans could include performance standards, emissions reductions or limits on generation for each existing fossil fuel-fired generating unit. It is unknown at this time what each state will require for emissions reductions from each Montana-Dakota owned and jointly owned fossil fuel-fired electric generating unit. In the EPA\u2019s proposed GHG rule for modified or reconstructed fossil fuel-fired sources, the EPA proposes emissions limits that could potentially be unachievable. Montana-Dakota does not plan to modify or reconstruct any fossil fuel-fired units at this time, but may modify or reconstruct units in the future which may require compliance with the rule limitations.\nThe Company\u2019s primary GHG emission is carbon dioxide from fossil fuels combustion at Montana-Dakota's electric generating facilities, particularly its coal-fired facilities. Approximately 60 percent of Montana-Dakota's owned generating capacity and more than 90 percent of the electricity it generates is from coal-fired facilities.\nThere may also be new treaties, legislation or regulations to reduce GHG emissions that could affect Montana-Dakota's electric utility operations by requiring additional energy conservation efforts or renewable energy sources, as well as other mandates that could significantly increase capital expenditures and operating costs. If Montana-Dakota does not receive timely and full recovery of GHG emission compliance costs from its customers, then such costs could adversely impact the results of its operations.\nIn addition to Montana-Dakota's electric generation operations, the GHG emissions from the Company's other operations are monitored, analyzed and reported as required by applicable laws and regulations. The Company monitors GHG regulations and the potential for GHG regulations to impact operations.\nDue to the uncertain availability of technologies to control GHG emissions and the unknown obligations that potential GHG emission legislation or regulations may create, the Company cannot determine the potential financial impact on its operations.\nThe Company is subject to government regulations that may delay and/or have a negative impact on its business and its results of operations and cash flows. Statutory and regulatory requirements also may limit another party's ability to acquire the Company.\nThe Company is subject to regulation or governmental actions by federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to, among other things, allowed rates of return and recovery of investment and cost, financing, industry rate structures, health care legislation, tax legislation and recovery of purchased power and purchased gas costs. These governmental regulations significantly influence the Company's operating environment and may affect its ability to recover costs from its customers. The Company is unable to predict the impact on operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows. Approval from a number of federal and state regulatory agencies would need to be obtained by any potential acquirer of the Company. The approval process could be lengthy and the outcome uncertain.\n24 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K\nPart I\nOther Risks\nWeather conditions can adversely affect the Company's operations, and revenues and cash flows.\nThe Company's results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, affect the ability to perform services at the construction materials and contracting and construction services businesses and affect ongoing operation and maintenance and construction and drilling activities for the pipeline and energy services and exploration and production businesses. In addition, severe weather can be destructive, causing outages, reduced oil and natural gas production, and/or property damage, which could require additional costs to be incurred. As a result, adverse weather conditions could negatively affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCompetition is increasing in all of the Company's businesses.\nAll of the Company's businesses are subject to increased competition. Construction services' competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality, safety and reliability. Construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions and are subject to such competitive forces as price, service, delivery time and proximity to the customer. The electric utility and natural gas industries also are experiencing increased competitive pressures as a result of consumer demands, technological advances, volatility in natural gas prices and other factors. The pipeline and energy services business competes with several pipelines for access to natural gas supplies and gathering, transportation and storage business. The exploration and production business is subject to competition in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties. The increase in competition could negatively affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Company could be subject to limitations on its ability to pay dividends.\nThe Company depends on earnings from its divisions and dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends on its common stock. Regulatory, contractual and legal limitations, as well as capital requirements and the Company's financial performance or cash flows, could limit the earnings of the Company's divisions and subsidiaries which, in turn, could restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and adversely affect the Company's stock price.\nAn increase in costs related to obligations under MEPPs could have a material negative effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious operating subsidiaries of the Company participate in approximately 85 MEPPs for employees represented by certain unions. The Company is required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under numerous collective bargaining agreements between the operating subsidiaries and those unions.\nThe Company may be obligated to increase its contributions to underfunded plans that are classified as being in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans classified as being in one of these statuses are required to adopt RPs or FIPs to improve their funded status through increased contributions, reduced benefits or a combination of the two. Based on available information, the Company believes that approximately 40 percent of the MEPPs to which it contributes are currently in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status.\nThe Company may also be required to increase its contributions to MEPPs where the other participating employers in such plans withdraw from the plan and are not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with their participants in the plans. The amount and timing of any increase in the Company's required contributions to MEPPs may also depend upon one or more of the following factors including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, actions taken by the plans' other participating employers, the industry for which contributions are made, future determinations that additional plans reach endangered, seriously endangered or critical status, government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among others. The Company may experience increased operating expenses as a result of the required contributions to MEPPs, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn addition, pursuant to ERISA, as amended by MPPAA, the Company could incur a partial or complete withdrawal liability upon withdrawing from a plan, exiting a market in which it does business with a union workforce or upon termination of a plan to the extent these plans are underfunded.\nOn September 24, 2014, Knife River provided notice to the plan administrator of one of the MEPPs to which it is a participating employer that it was withdrawing from that plan effective October 26, 2014. The plan administrator will determine Knife River\u2019s withdrawal liability, which the Company currently estimates at approximately $14 million (approximately $8.4 million after tax). The assessed withdrawal liability for this plan may be significantly different from the current estimate.\nMDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 25\nPart I\nThe Company's operations may be negatively impacted by cyber attacks or acts of terrorism.\nThe Company operates in industries that require continual operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. While the Company has developed procedures and processes that are designed to strengthen and protect these systems, they may be vulnerable to failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of terrorism or other causes. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and these systems were not recovered in a timely manner, the Company's operational systems and infrastructure, such as the Company's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities and its oil and natural gas production, storage and pipeline systems, may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, including a loss of service to customers. Any such disruption could result in a decrease in the Company's revenues and/or significant remediation costs which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, because generation, transmission systems and gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, a disruption elsewhere in the system could negatively impact the Company's business.\nThe Company's business requires access to sensitive customer, employee and Company data in the ordinary course of business. Despite the Company's implementation of security measures, a failure or breach of a security system could compromise sensitive and confidential information and data. Such an event could result in negative publicity and reputational harm, remediation costs and possible legal claims and fines which could adversely affect the Company's financial results, notwithstanding the purchase of cyber risk insurance. The Company's third party service providers that perform critical business functions or have access to sensitive and confidential information and data may also be vulnerable to security breaches and other risks that could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nWhile the Company plans to market and sell its exploration and production business, there is no assurance that it will be successful.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s corporate strategy, it plans to market and sell its exploration and production assets and exit that line of business. The Company has delayed its plan to market Fidelity in light of the recent volatility of oil prices. At such time as the marketing resumes, such a disposition and exit will be subject to various risks, including: suitable purchasers may not be available or willing to purchase the assets on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company or may only be interested in acquiring a portion of the assets; the agreements pursuant to which the Company divests the assets may contain continuing indemnification obligations; the inability to obtain waivers from applicable covenants under debt agreements; the Company may incur substantial costs in connection with the marketing and sale of the assets; the marketing and sale of the assets could distract management, divert resources, disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and make it difficult for the Company to maintain its current business standards, controls and procedures; uncertainties associated with the sale may cause a loss of key management personnel at Fidelity which could make it more difficult to sell the assets or operate the business in the event that the Company is unable to sell it; sale of the assets could result in substantial tax liability; the Company may be required to record an impairment charge that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition; and the Company may not be able to redeploy the proceeds from any sale of the assets in a manner that produces similar revenues and growth rates or enhances shareholder value.\nOther factors that could impact the Company's businesses.\nThe following are other factors that should be considered for a better understanding of the financial condition of the Company. These other factors may impact the Company's financial results in future periods.\n\u2022\nAcquisition, disposal and impairments of assets or facilities\n\u2022\nChanges in operation, performance and construction of plant facilities or other assets\n\u2022\nChanges in present or prospective generation\n\u2022\nThe ability to obtain adequate and timely cost recovery for the Company's regulated operations through regulatory proceedings\n\u2022\nThe availability of economic expansion or development opportunities\n\u2022\nPopulation growth rates and demographic patterns\n\u2022\nMarket demand for, available supplies of, and/or costs of, energy- and construction-related products and services\n\u2022\nThe cyclical nature of large construction projects at certain operations\n\u2022\nChanges in tax rates or policies\n\u2022\nUnanticipated project delays or changes in project costs, including related energy costs\n\u2022\nUnanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures\n\u2022\nLabor negotiations or disputes\n\u2022\nInability of the various contract counterparties to meet their contractual obligations\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting principles and/or the application of such principles to the Company\n\u2022\nChanges in technology\n26 MDU Resources Group, Inc.
