Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves an extremely high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding to invest in the Company\u2019s common stock. You should only purchase our securities if you can afford to suffer the loss of your entire investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe Company has incurred loss since inception and the Company\u2019s auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company commenced generating revenues from operations in 2011. The Company has incurred operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, has a working capital deficiency of $2,923,247 and an accumulated deficit of $76,378,261 as of December 31, 2014.\nIn their report dated April 15, 2015, the Company\u2019s independent registered auditor , Paritz & Company PA, stated that the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, were prepared assuming that it would continue as a going concern. However, they also expressed substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to experience operating losses. We can give no assurance as to our ability to raise sufficient capital or our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the successful raise of sufficient working capital.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business strategy depends on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully secure raising additional working capital. The Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of significant losses due to certain debt instruments. The Company also continues to experience operating losses. Although not specifically determined at this time, the company intends to continue to investigate and pursue options and methods of raising capital to meet its financing needs and financial goals, however we can give no assurance as to our ability to raise such sufficient capital or our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is dependent on the continued participation and level of service of its third-party service provider(s).\nThe Company relies on third-party service providers to provide certain services to us and/or our customers. If any of these third-party service providers stop supporting the Company or if our network of providers does not expand, we will likely have to expand our internal team to meet the needs of our customers, which could increase our operating costs and result in lower gross margins. We can make no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain the third-party relationships or establish additional relationships as necessary to support growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms.\nDefects, failures or quality issues associated with the products the Company distributes could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the Company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect its business and reputation and result in loss of customers. Loss reserves are difficult to estimate.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types the Company distributes entail inherent risks. There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that the Company distributes, including quality issues, component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of the products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. Any of these issues could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of the products distributed by the Company. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the FDA could result in significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of the products, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, decrease demand for the products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm the Company\u2019s ability to successfully launch and market in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits including those being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class or establish multi-district litigation proceedings, and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe Company faces competition from existing providers, as well as new providers entering its markets.\nThe Company\u2019s medical equipment and device business operates in competitive areas and markets. Basic barriers to entry-level product distribution in the healthcare industry can be relatively low and the products the Company distributes may face challenges in market adoption due to the reliance of physicians and other medical professionals on existing devices, equipment and diagnostic tools. In addition, physicians and other medical professionals may view certain devices distributed by the Company as a screening tool for existing illnesses, rather than as an early detection or preventative tool. As a result, certain products may be deemed to compete directly with existing, established procedures, which could impair market adoption of such products.\nThe Company\u2019s physician practice administration business operates in competitive areas and markets. The Company\u2019s clients compete with other PAD practice management providers, practices and surgical clinics that provide PAD and atherectomy procedures and vascular surgeons. Basic barriers to entry-level practice management in the cardiovascular and PAD care industry can be relatively low.\nNew distributors and new healthcare providers that enter the Company\u2019s markets impact the Company\u2019s market share, business volume and growth rates. Increased competitive pressures require the Company to commit resources to marketing efforts, which impacts the Company\u2019s margins and profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively with existing providers in its markets or that new competitors will not enter into its markets. These existing and new competitors may have greater financial and other resources than the Company does. Increased competition could also make it more difficult for the Company to expand its business.\nThe development of alternative treatments could diminish demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nThe healthcare industry is dynamic, and new, technologically intensive devices are constantly under development. New devices that are more effective could decrease patient demand or profitability for the products that the Company currently distributes and patients could seek treatment elsewhere.\nIf the Company is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, it could be subject to significant fines or penalties, be forced to curtail certain of our operations or rearrange material agreements to its detriment.\nThe Company is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback laws, controlled substances laws, the federal Stark law and state self-referral laws, false claims laws, the HIPAA, Medicare and Medicaid regulations and laws regulating the business of insurance. These laws and regulations are extremely complex and could be subject to various interpretations. Many aspects of the Company\u2019s business, to date, have not been the subject of federal or state regulatory review and the Company may not have been in compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations. If the Company is found by a court or regulatory authority to have violated any applicable laws or regulations, the Company could be subject to significant fines or penalties or be forced to curtail certain of its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on retaining key members of its management team.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business strategy depends on the continued contribution of key members of its management team. The loss of key members of this team could disrupt its growth plans and its ability to implement its business strategy.\nEconomic instability could continue to adversely affect the Company.\nFinancial markets and the economies in the United States and internationally may continue to experience disruption and volatility as they have in recent years and conditions could worsen. As a result, the economic environment (including deteriorating economic conditions in certain countries in Europe) may, among other things:\n\u00a8 increase the sales cycle for certain of our products;\n\u00a8 slow the adoption of new technology;\n\u00a8 adversely affect the Company\u2019s suppliers, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to distribute the products; and\n\u00a8 limit the Company access to capital on terms acceptable to the Company.\nThese conditions may continue in the future. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWe may be subject to significant liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates as well as from physician locations under management, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the administration and support of healthcare facilities and the processing, marketing and distribution of medical device products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to current and any future product candidates and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of such products once distribution begins. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. The manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims.\nWe will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing product candidates, if ever. At that time, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.\nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.\nWe seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.\nThere is no guarantee that the market for our products or services will develop, and it exposes us to risks inherent in the long-term distribution and growth of our products and services.\nThere currently is no significant global market for our product candidates, nor is there any guarantee that such markets will develop in the near future, or at all. Adverse outcomes or limitations of our products or services, including, but not limited to damage, destruction or a failure in performance or facility or systems of our service providers, could harm our reputation and business and expose us to significant liability from customers. While we believe that we will procure insurance to cover certain of these risks, we may in fact have insufficient insurance to cover losses beyond the limits on its policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nHealthcare companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the Federal False Claims Act, including under Healthcare Reform, have made it easier for private parties to bring \u201c qui tam \u201d (whistleblower) lawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback law, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. We are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our physician facilities or management. While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business, clients or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\nIt is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the products distributed or the physician practices to which our administration services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by an increasing uninsured population and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States.\nTo the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for cardiovascular procedures and treatment or for medical device products, they may elect not to provide such therapies and products to their patients and, thus, may not need our products or services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers.\nSimilarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, which may accelerate under the healthcare reform legislation approved by Congress on March 23, 2010 and thereafter signed into law (\u201cHealthcare Reform\u201d), could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare support services and products, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our products and support services.\nFederal health care programs, such as Medicare, are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of physician services and products covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly to physicians could significantly influence the products sold to, and our administration and support services for, such physicians and their facilities. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other product and services over products and services the company provides, such reform could affect our ability to sell our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, physician services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services provided to such healthcare facilities.\nFurthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been an increase in the number of people who do not have any form of health care coverage in recent years and who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The extent to which the reforms brought about under Healthcare Reform may be successful in reducing the number of such uninsured is unclear, and the reduced funding of governmental programs and increase in uninsured populations could have a negative impact on the demand for our administration services to the extent they relate to such products sold and administrative services provided to physician facilities which are reimbursed by government and private payors.\nAdditionally, and more specifically reimbursements and reimbursement rates for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) procedures are currently under review and a negative change could drastically affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully and profitably perform practice management and administration for physicians which could further result in the discontinuance of that business segment.\nUnintended consequences of recently adopted healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the U.S., comprehensive programs are under consideration that seek to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. On March 23, 2010, healthcare reform legislation was approved by Congress and has been signed into law. While we do not believe this legislation will have a direct impact on our business, the legislation has only recently been enacted and requires the adoption of implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business. For instance, the scope and implications of the recent amendments pursuant to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (\u201cFERA\u201d), have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business. Also, in some instances our clients may be health insurers that will be subject to limitations on their administrative expenses and new federal review of \u201cunreasonable\u201d rate increases that could impact the prices they pay for our services. If the legislation causes such unintended consequences or indirect impact, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDefects or disruptions in our services and products along with changes in reimbursement rates and procedures could diminish demand, delay or defer collection cycles for accounts receivable and subject us to substantial liability.\nBecause our products and service are complex, our services may be subject to errors and our products may have defects that are identified after use that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm our reputation and our business. We have from time to time found defects and errors in our services and products and new defects and errors may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use products and services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service or product use. Since our customers use our products and services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our products or services could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Furthermore, our customers are physician and healthcare profession facilities who rely on health care programs, such as Medicare, for medical procedures performed and medical devices used in their practices and are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of physician services and products covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us,\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s Stock Has Historically Had a Limited Market and the Trading Prices May Be Volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock may be based on factors that may not be indicative of future market performance. Consequently, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may vary greatly. There is a significant risk that the Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control:\n\u25cf variations in the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf announcements that the Company\u2019s revenue or income/loss levels are below analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf general economic slowdowns;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant contracts; or\n\u25cf acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nBecause the Company\u2019s Shares Are Deemed \u201cPenny Stocks,\u201d You May Have Difficulty Selling Them In The Secondary Trading Market.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, if the equity security is not registered or authorized on a national securities exchange that makes certain reports available, the equity security may also constitute a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d As the Company\u2019s common stock comes within the definition of penny stock, these regulations require the delivery by the broker-dealer, prior to any transaction involving the Company\u2019s common stock, of a risk disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and any salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for the Company\u2019s common stock. The ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and the ability of shareholders to sell the Company\u2019s common stock in the secondary market would be limited. As a result, the market liquidity for the Company\u2019s common stock would be severely and adversely affected. The Company can provide no assurance that trading in the Company\u2019s common stock will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future, which would negatively affect the market for the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company IS Subject To The Reporting Requirements Of Federal Securities Laws, Which Can Be Expensive.\nThe Company is subject to the information and reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC causes our expenses to be higher than they would be if the Company was a privately-held company.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could lead to inaccuracies in its reported financial results.\nA material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Moreover, any failure to establish and maintain effective systems of internal control and procedures may impair its ability to accurately report its financial results. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of the material weakness described in this Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Such failures and the reporting that the Company\u2019s system of internal controls over financial reporting was not effective could result in a restatement of its financial statements and cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could result in a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price. In\nIn addition to potential dilution associated with future fundraising transactions, we currently have significant numbers of securities outstanding that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe issuance of these shares in the future would result in significant dilution to our current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and the terms on which we could raise additional capital. In addition, the issuance and subsequent trading of shares could cause the supply of our Common Stock available for purchase in the market to exceed the purchase demand for our Common Stock. Such supply in excess of demand could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nActual and beneficial ownership of large quantities of our Common Stock and certain Preferred Stock by our executive officers and directors may substantially reduce the influence of other stockholders.\nAs a result, such persons may have the ability to exercise enhanced control and influence over the approval process for actions that require stockholder approval, including the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or other matters submitted for stockholder approval. Furthermore, at certain times the interests of our substantial stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nIf we are unsuccessful in raising the required capital or building or contracting for commercial sales and marketing capabilities in the United States, our revenues from any future products will be adversely affected.\nWe currently have no capabilities or experience in the selling, marketing or commercial distribution of medical device products. We currently have product candidates that are ultimately approved for marketing, and would need to hire and develop an internal sales and marketing organization and/or outsource these functions to one or more third parties.\nWe may be unable to secure the required capital or be unable to establish sufficient marketing, sales and distribution capabilities necessary to successfully inventory, commercialize and gain market acceptance for any of our product candidates. In addition, co-promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize product candidates could significantly limit the revenues we recognize from such product candidates, and these third parties may fail to commercialize the product candidates successfully.\nFactors outside the Company's control could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill.\nWe are required to analyze goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. Factors out of the Company's control, including, but not limited to the economic environment, market capitalization, federal and local government regulations and anticipated cash flows of the Company could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill. The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. If an impairment is found to exist, we will be required to record a non-cash asset impairment charge which could be significant.", "PERMNO": 81214, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "MHCC"}
