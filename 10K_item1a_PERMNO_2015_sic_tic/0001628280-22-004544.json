{"cik": "1178970", "company": "PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks inherent to the financial services industry. The following discusses the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations. If any of the following conditions or events actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company's risk factors are categorized as follows:\n\u2022Risks Related to the Economy, Financial Markets, and Interest Rates\n\u2022Risks Related to Regulatory, Compliance, Environmental and Legal Matters\n\u2022Risks Related to Business Environment and Operations.\n\u2022Risks Related to Technology and Security\nRisks Related to the Economy, Financial Markets, and Interest Rates\nChanges to the underlying drivers of our net interest income could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates and influence the behavior of our customer base. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. A flattening yield curve, or one that inverts, could negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.\nOur interest-bearing liabilities may be subject to repricing or maturing more quickly than our interest-earning assets. If short-term rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than we can increase the interest rates we earn on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income. In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts or are lost to competitors offering higher rates on their deposit products. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest income could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures prevent us from reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2021, our available for sale debt securities portfolio totaled $2.06 billion. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Therefore, decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nVolatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s borrowers or result in lower values for the Company\u2019s investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on our loan monitoring program, our loan quality reviews, our credit risk rating process, loan portfolio trends, our experience, our evaluation of economic conditions and our selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast, among other factors. The Company measures projected credit losses over the estimated life of the asset by applying quantitative and qualitative loss factors we derive using a macroeconomic forecast that we deem most likely to occur. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans expose us to increased risk and earnings volatility.\nWe consider our commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans to be higher risk categories in our loan portfolio. These loans are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. At December 31, 2021, our portfolio of commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, totaled $5.19 billion, or 54.6% of total loans, our commercial and industrial loans totaled $2.19 billion, or 23.0% of portfolio loans, and our construction loans totaled $683.2 million, or 7.2% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans.\nCommercial real estate loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate also often depend on the successful operation and management of the businesses that occupy these properties or the financial stability of tenants occupying the properties. Furthermore, these loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In the case of commercial and industrial loans, although we strive to maintain high credit standards and limit exposure to any one borrower, the collateral for these loans often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. This type of collateral typically does not yield substantial recovery in the event we need to foreclose on it and may rapidly deteriorate, disappear, or be misdirected in advance of foreclosure. This adds to the potential that our charge-offs will be volatile, which could significantly negatively affect our earnings in any quarter. In addition, some of our construction loans may pose higher risk than the levels expected at origination, as projects may stall, absorption may be slower than projected or sales prices may be lower than forecasted. In addition, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or construction loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose the Company to significantly greater risk of loss.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Compliance, Environmental and Legal Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination of various regulatory authorities, but primarily by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to require that we hold additional capital, restrict our operations,\nmodify the classification of our assets, increase our allowance for credit losses, and strengthen the management of risks posed by our reliance on third party vendors. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and, liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends that may be identified in our examinations, which may include the potential for the issuance of formal enforcement orders. Further, actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not provide the level of beneficial effects necessary to offset their cost to us. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could further increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, may also significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nAs a financial institution with assets greater than $10 Billion, we are subject to additional regulation and increased supervision, including by the CFPB.\nProvident's total assets were $13.78 billion at December 31, 2021. Banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations including being subject to the examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assess our compliance with federal consumer financial laws, the imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, and enhanced risk management frameworks, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.\nWe may be required to invest more significant management attention and resources to make further changes necessary to comply with enhanced regulatory expectations. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations may have on us, these changes could be material.\nWe face regulatory scrutiny based on our commercial real estate lending.\nThe FDIC, the OCC and the FRB (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) have issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans (\u201cCRE Loans\u201d), represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the CRE Loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. While our level of CRE Loans equaled 471.4% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2021, our CRE Loan portfolio has not increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If our regulators were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our loan portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, our earnings or our ability to engage in certain merger and acquisition activity could be adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited due to regulatory issues.\nFuture acquisitions by the Company, particularly those of financial institutions, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies (collectively, \"regulatory approvals\"). Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new issues the Company has, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to BSA/AML compliance, CRA compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations, and other similar laws and regulations. We may fail to pursue or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. The regulatory approvals may contain conditions on the completion of a merger which would adversely affect our business following the closing, or which were not anticipated or cannot be met. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $444.4 million and other intangible assets of $19.8 million. Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future amortization expense and potential impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. Impairment testing incorporates the current market price of our common stock, the estimated fair value of our assets and liabilities, and certain information of similar companies. Impairment testing may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in the identification of a decline in the fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets, which may be less than the carrying value. If we determine that impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of goodwill or other related intangible asset will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If we record an impairment loss related to our goodwill or other intangible assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on our goodwill or other intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.\nClimate change and related governmental action may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create a level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue and have entered into international agreements in an effort to reduce global temperatures such as the Paris Agreement, which the United States re-joined as of February 19, 2021. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors, and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict specifically how climate change may impact the financial condition and operations of the Company; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact the Company. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing certain loans in our portfolios. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact our ability to raise and invest capital in potentially impacted communities. The effects of changing strategies, policies, and investments as the global community transitions to a lower-carbon economy will impose additional operational and compliance burdens, and may result in market trends that alter business opportunities. Overall, climate change, its effects, and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Related to Business Environment and Operations.\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic dislocation which resulted in prolonged stress on economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Certain industries were particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. While much of the national economy has reopened, significant uncertainty remains concerning the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their longer-term impact on the U.S. economy.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the emergence of variants and level of infections, efficacy and availability of therapeutics, the speed, strength and extent of a full economic recovery, and any adverse economic impact from future actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Company could be subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our respective business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022if the economy is unable to fully reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charge-offs and reduced loan repayments impacting cash flows and liquidity;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause credit losses to increase;\n\u2022our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s investment portfolio may suffer a substantial decrease in value;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s wealth management revenues may decline with market turmoil;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and\n\u2022the Company's reliance on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the pandemic could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThese factors, among others, together or in combination with other events or occurrences not yet known or anticipated, could adversely affect the operations of the Company.\nGovernmental and regulatory actions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material decline in\nour earnings and pose additional risks.\nThere have been several regulatory and legislative actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals and businesses, including mandates requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19, mandatory loan forbearances and to participate in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"). In addition, the governors of many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located have issued temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures. Due to the unforeseen nature of the pandemic, future regulatory action is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Further, there have been several other bank regulatory actions and legislative changes intended to help mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19. These regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded, extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continue.\nThe Company has offered, and if necessary may once again offer, payment deferrals, forbearances, and other forms of assistance to commercial, small business and consumer customers that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If these customers are unable to repay their loans in a timely manner when payment deferrals, forbearances or other forms of assistance end, delinquency levels may increase, the Company may be required to reverse the accrual of interest during the deferral or forbearance period, and there may be a need to provide additional reserves for credit losses. The Company\u2019s participation in PPP could expose us to the risk of civil litigation or regulatory scrutiny regarding the processing and forgiveness of PPP loans.\nOur continuing concentration of business in a relatively confined region may increase our risk.\nOur success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in our market area. Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking, financial, and wealth management services to customers mostly\nlocated in our primary markets. Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations and the value of the collateral securing our loans. Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, state or local government action, or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our business.\nWe have a significant amount of real estate loans. Depressed real estate values and real estate sales could have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition. These changes have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, like New Jersey. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in our market area. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is a global financial benchmark and reference rate that we use to set interest rates for a significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio. At December 31, 2021, loans utilizing the LIBOR rate totaled $1.94 billion. The marketplace that sets the LIBOR rate no longer supports certain tenors (e.g. overnight, 1 month, 3 month, etc.) of LIBOR as of December 31, 2021 and has announced that it will no longer support the remaining tenors after June 2023.\nThe Bank was not impacted by the partial LIBOR cessations as of December 31, 2021. If LIBOR is completely discontinued after June 2023 as expected, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments, and such discontinuation may increase operational and other risks to the Company and the industry. The Company is in the process of selecting an alternative rate that is most applicable.\nActs of terrorism, severe weather, natural disasters, public health issues, geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nOur business is subject to risk from external events that could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. For example, financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems. The metropolitan New York and Philadelphia areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers. Additionally, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale geopolitical, political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber-attacks. The emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, similar to the spread of COVID-19, could lead to regional quarantines, business shutdowns, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by any current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\nA general economic slowdown or uncertainty that produces either reduced returns or excessive market volatility could adversely impact our overall profitability, including our wealth management fee income.\nA general economic slowdown could affect our core banking business. Headwinds facing the U.S. economy continued during 2021, even as the economy recovered from the COVID-19 induced recession, noting in particular that the New Jesrey unemployment rate remains above its pre-pandemic level. The consensus forecast has the economy continuing its recovery from the recession brought about by the pandemic, largely due to unprecedented fiscal support and monetary stimulus. Adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or force us to offer lower interest rates to encourage new borrowing activity.\nFurthermore, uncertainty and market volatility regardless of overall market conditions, could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income. Conditions that produce extended market volatility could affect our ability to provide our clients with an adequate return, thereby impacting our ability to attract new clients or causing existing clients to seek more stable investment opportunities with alternative wealth advisors.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the FDIC, along with other banking agencies, has the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us, including restricting our ability to grow through acquisition. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost, or meet regulatory-imposed expectations for liquidity levels. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan originations and commitments, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments, sales, maturities, and prepayments of loans and investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general. Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn, lack of competitiveness, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense and expanding with entrants into our market providing new and innovative technology-driven financial solutions. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, online lenders, large non-bank participants, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating both locally and elsewhere.\nIn particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide. There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors with large capital positions in our market who may deploy aggressive strategies to drive growth, take our customers and win market share.\nFurthermore, key components of the financial services value chain have been replicated by digital innovation, commonly referred to as Fintech. As customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. In addition, some of the largest technology firms are engaging in joint ventures with the largest banks to provide and or expand financial service offerings with a technological sophistication and breadth of marketing that smaller institutions do not have. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. The adoption of these Fintech solutions within our market area may cause greater and faster disruption to our business model if we are unable to keep pace with, or invest wisely in, these enabling technologies. In July 2018, the OCC announced that it will\nbegin accepting applications from Fintechs to become special purpose national banks. Although the OCC\u2019s authority to issue special purpose bank charters to non-bank Fintechs continues to be subject to ongoing litigation, similar developments are likely to result in even greater competition within all areas of our operations.\nRisks Related to Technology & Security\nA cyber-attack, data breach, or a technology failure of ours could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems to provide secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential and proprietary information.\nCyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. Financial institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, its employees, customers or third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations.\nWe have experienced cyber security incidents in the past, although not material, and we anticipate that, as a larger bank, we could experience further incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses or other material adverse consequences relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions from customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity could result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nMisuse of our technology by our employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. We may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect these types of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject us to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nAs cyber threats and other fraudulent activity continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Any of these matters could result in our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs. In addition, any of the matters described above could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. A breach, failure, interruption, cessation of an important service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, as well as cause reputational harm.\nWe are dependent for most of our technology, including our core operating system, on third-party providers. The Bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by third-party service providers, which are integral to our business. We handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. Our financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, or ATMs, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged because of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control.\nWe have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to third-parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with our own systems. If these third-parties were to discontinue providing services to us, we may experience significant disruption to our business. In addition, each of these third-parties faces the risk of cyber-attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. If any of our third-party service providers experience such difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our\nrelationships with them, we may be required to find alternative sources of such services. If any of our third-party service providers experience a breach or cyber-attack of their information systems it could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, service our clients or manage our exposure to risk and could result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information, which could have a material adverse impact on our business through damage to our reputation, loss of business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Assurance cannot be provided that we could negotiate terms with alternative service sources that are as favorable or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all, thereby resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, and cause reputational harm. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise because of an operational deficiency or because of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. While we maintain a risk management program that is designed to minimize risk, we could suffer losses, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation because of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nFailure to keep pace with technological changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers, reduce costs and create capacity. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89653, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "PFS"}
