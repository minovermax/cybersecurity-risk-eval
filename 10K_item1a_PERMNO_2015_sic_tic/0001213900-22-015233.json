RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully read the risk factors set forth below, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below. The risks described below, however, are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Please refer to the discussion of \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d on page one of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nWe have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may incur significant losses in the future. These losses may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers. We have incurred net losses of $0.7 million, $1.1 million, $1.1 million, $17.8 million and $62.9 million in 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although we recorded net income of $963,000 in 2018, there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability in future periods.\nWe are exploring, evaluating and have begun implementing certain strategic alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying additional strategic alternatives or implementing any strategic alternative, or that any strategic alternative will yield additional value for stockholders.\nOur management and Board of Directors are continuing to review strategic alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders. These alternatives could result in, among other things, modifying or eliminating certain of our operations, selling material assets, seeking additional financing, selling the business, making investments, effecting a merger, consolidation or other business combination, partnering or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions.\nThere can be no assurance that our continued exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification of additional alternatives or that any transaction will be consummated. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be costly and may be time consuming, distracting to management and disruptive to our business operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot provide assurance that any potential transaction, investment or other alternative identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction or investment would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the availability of financing to us on reasonable terms.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies; if we do, we may be unable to integrate them with our business effectively or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities and have adequate funding, we may acquire other businesses, product lines or technologies. However, if we acquire a business, product line or technology, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. Further, the acquisition of a business may result in the assumption of unknown liabilities or create risks with respect to our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. If we make acquisitions, we may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may not be able to execute the acquisition of other businesses.\nWe may require additional capital to fund operations, capital expenditures and or the acquisition of other businesses. We may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our new products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, if our success in generating sufficient operating cash flow or our use of cash in the next twelve months were to significantly adversely change, we may not have enough funds available to continue operating at our current level in future periods. A limitation of funds available may raise concerns about our ability to continue to operate. Such concerns may limit our ability to obtain financing and some customers may not be willing to do business with us.\nRubicon Technology Worldwide\nWe rely on third parties for certain material and finishing steps for our products, including the slicing and polishing of our sapphire crystal.\nIn order to reduce product costs and improve cash flow, we use third parties for certain material and finishing functions for our products, including the slicing and polishing of our sapphire crystal inventory. These types of services are only available from a limited number of third parties. Our ability to successfully outsource these finishing functions will substantially depend on our ability to develop, maintain and expand our strategic relationship with these third parties. Any impairment in our relationships with the third parties performing these functions, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. In addition, we do not control any of these third parties or the operation of their facilities, and we may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the third parties performing our finishing functions. Accordingly, any difficulties encountered by these third parties that result in product defects, delays or defaults on their contractual commitments to us could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, their facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, inclement weather conditions, power loss, acts of terrorism and similar events. A decision to close a facility without adequate notice as a result of these or other unanticipated problems at the facility could result in lengthy interruptions in their services to us; and any loss or interruption of these services could significantly increase our expenses, cause us to default on our obligations to our customers and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the outsourcing of our finishing steps, such as slicing and polishing of wafers, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur gross margins could fluctuate as a result of changes in our product mix and other factors, which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell in any given period. We are working to increase sales of higher margin products, introduce new differentiated products and lower our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in improving our gross margin mix. If we are not successful, our overall gross margin levels and operating results in future periods would continue to be adversely impacted. Increased competition and the adoption of alternatives to our products, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand and other factors may lead to a further downward shift in our product margins, leading to price erosion and lower revenues for us in the future.\nThe markets in which we operate are very competitive, and many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.\nThe markets for selling high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe average selling prices of sapphire products have historically been volatile and in recent years sapphire product prices have been increasingly depressed.\nHistorically, our industry has experienced volatility in product demand and pricing. However, in the last five years, the sales prices for our sapphire products have trended downward due to an over-supply of products in the market. In some countries, government programs support sapphire producers who would otherwise be unprofitable; in such circumstances, sapphire may be sold at prices below cost for an extended period of time, depressing market prices, to the detriment of our gross margins. This has had a significant adverse impact on our profitability and our results of operations. Moreover, changes in average selling prices of our products as a result of competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts and new product introductions by our competitors could have a significant impact on our profitability. Although we attempt to optimize our product mix, introduce new products, reduce manufacturing costs and pass along certain increases in costs to our customers in order to lessen the effect of decreases in selling prices, we may not be able to successfully do so in a timely manner or at all, and our results of operations and business may be harmed.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results for particular periods to fall below expectations.\nOur revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In connection with the Board of Directors\u2019 continuing review of alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders, the Board decided to limit our business focus to the optical and industrial sapphire markets and to exit the LED and mobile device markets. The optical and industrial sapphire markets are smaller markets than our historical undertakings and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our optical and industrial sapphire business, or that such shift in focus will ultimately improve our profitability or operating results.\nWe depend on a few customers for a major portion of our sales and our results of operations would be adversely impacted if they reduce their order volumes.\nHistorically, we have earned, and believe that in the future we will continue to earn, a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. In 2021, our top three customers accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 46% of our revenue from our continuing operations, and in 2020, our top four customers accounted for approximately 55% of our revenue from our continuing operations. If we were to lose one of our major customers or have a major customer significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our revenues and profitability would be materially reduced unless we are able to replace such demand with other orders promptly. We expect to continue to be dependent on our major customers, the number and identity of which may change from period to period.\nWe generally sell our products on the basis of purchase orders. Thus, most of our customers could cease purchasing our products with little or no notice and without penalties. In addition, delays in product orders could cause our quarterly revenue to vary significantly. A number of factors could cause our customers to cancel or defer orders, including interruptions to their operations due to a downturn in their industries, natural disasters, delays in manufacturing their own product offerings into which our products are incorporated, securing other sources for the products that we manufacture or developing such products internally.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel. The inability to attract and retain necessary technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel could harm our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products and could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the loss of the services, or distraction, of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on the continued services and performances of certain senior management employees such as sales management and the head of operations.\nOur future success is dependent on the continued services and contributions of our senior management who must work together effectively in order to design and produce our products, expand our business, increase our revenue and improve our operating results. The loss of services of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur gross margins and profitability may be adversely affected by energy costs.\nAll of our power consumption takes place in our manufacturing facility in the United States. Electricity prices could increase due to overall changes to the price of energy due to conditions in the Middle East, natural gas shortages in the U.S. and other economic conditions and uncertainties regarding the outcome and implications of such events. If electricity prices increase significantly, we may not be able to pass these price increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights and the defense of claims of infringement against us by third parties may subject us to costly litigation.\nOther companies might allege that we are infringing certain of their patents or other rights. If we are unable to resolve these matters satisfactorily, or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms, we may face litigation. Any litigation to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how possessed by us or to defend us or indemnify others against claimed infringement of the rights of others could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Regardless of the validity or successful outcome of any such intellectual property claims, we may need to expend significant time and expense to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we lose any such litigation where we are alleged to infringe the rights of others, we may be required to:\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf seek licenses from others; or\n\u25cf change, or stop manufacturing or selling, some or all of our products.\nAny of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which could expose us to environmental liabilities, increase our manufacturing and related compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn our manufacturing process, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include those relating to the use, storage, handling, discharge, emission, disposal and reporting of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes. These materials may have been or could be released into the environment at properties currently or previously operated by us, at other locations during the transport of the materials, or at properties to which we send substances for treatment or disposal. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations or become non-compliant with permits required at some of our facilities, we could be held financially responsible and incur substantial costs, including investigation and cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damages or personal injury claims. In addition, new laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations could give rise to additional compliance costs and liabilities.\nRTW\u2019s operations are concentrated in one facility, and the unavailability of this facility could harm our business.\nOur manufacturing, research and development, sales and marketing, and administrative activities are concentrated in one facility located in Bensenville, Illinois. Going forward, this will be RTW\u2019s sole operating facility. Should a casualty, natural disaster, inclement weather, an outbreak of disease, power loss, an act of terrorism or similar event affect the Chicagoland area, our operations could be significantly impacted. We may not be able to replicate the manufacturing capacity and other operations of our Bensenville facility or such replication could take significant time and resources to accomplish. The disruption from such an event could adversely affect or interrupt entirely our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are dependent on information technology, and disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and cloud services, many of which are managed by third parties, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information of financial, marketing, legal and regulatory nature to manage our business processes and activities. Although we have implemented enhanced controls around our information technology systems, these systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, or our operations may be disrupted, exposing us to performance failures with customers. In addition, cybersecurity threats, such as computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that our security controls and safeguard measures taken to improve our cybersecurity protection will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. Potential consequences of a cybersecurity attack include disruption to systems, corruption of data, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, reputational damage, and litigation with third parties. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities related to a cybersecurity attack.\nOur U.S. NOL carryforwards may expire or could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) or if changes are made to the IRC.\nWe have significant U.S. NOL carryforwards. Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our NOLs to reduce our future U.S. taxable income and tax liabilities until such NOL carryforwards expire in accordance with the IRC of 1986, as amended. Our NOL carryforwards provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state income in future years to use the benefits before they expire, we will permanently lose the benefit of the NOL carryforwards. Our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOL carryforwards is dependent upon our generation of future taxable profits and our ability to successfully identify and consummate suitable acquisitions or investment opportunities.\nAdditionally, Section 382 and Section 383 of the IRC provide an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards, as well as certain built-in losses, against the future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership, as defined under the IRC. While we have implemented a stockholder\u2019s right plan to protect our NOL carryforwards, there is no assurance that we will not experience a change in ownership in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership, and any such subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the IRC could further limit our ability to use our NOL carryforwards.\nUnder the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act, U.S. NOLs generated on or after January 1, 2018, could be limited to 80% of taxable income. If other changes were made to the IRC, they could impact our ability to utilize our NOLs. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The Company maintains a limited staff of full-time employees in skilled technical, non-technical and key management positions. If employees become infected by the COVID-19 virus we may not be able to maintain normal business operations for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. The Company is heavily reliant on domestic and foreign supply chains to operate its businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic may limit and restrict our access to necessary products that are required to operate.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company\u2019s products and services; the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and each of which could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 value.\nFactors related to our Company and our business, as well as broad market and industry factors, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Such factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price include, among other things:\n\u25cf changes in financial guidance or estimates by us, by investors or by any financial analysts who might cover our stock or our industry;\n\u25cf our ability to meet the performance expectations of financial analysts or investors;\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf the size of the public float of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests.\nA number of provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, may have the effect of delaying, deterring, preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of Rubicon that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a classified Board of Directors;\n\u25cf a tax benefits preservation plan designed to preserve our ability to utilize our net operating losses as a result of certain stock ownership changes, which may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership;\n\u25cf granting to the Board of Directors sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors;\n\u25cf prohibition on stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibition on stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\u25cf establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the Board of Directors at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThe foregoing provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defend.\nAll industries, including ours, are subject to legal claims, including securities litigation. When the market price of a stock declines significantly, due to factors such as trends in the stock market in general, broad market and industry fluctuations or operating performance, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. This sort of litigation can be particularly costly and may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We have been subject to securities class action litigation in the past, as disclosed in our previous filings with the SEC. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding (including by settlement) could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace.\nOur Board of Directors does not intend to declare or pay any dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors the Board of Directors considers relevant. There is no plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and if dividends are paid, there can be no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.", "PERMNO": 92448, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "RBCN"}
