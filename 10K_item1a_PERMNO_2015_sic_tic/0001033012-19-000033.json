RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors identified elsewhere in this Report, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business are set forth below.\nMarket, Interest Rate, Credit and Liquidity Risk\nEconomic and general conditions in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by economic and market conditions, political uncertainty and social conditions, factors impacting the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and the sustainability of economic growth. Deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our business segments, the level of credit risk we have assumed, our capital levels, liquidity, and our results of operations.\nDomestic and international fiscal and monetary policies also affect our business. Central bank actions, particularly those of the Federal Reserve, can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as investment securities and MSRs, and their policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the cost of running our business.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations including our net interest margin, mortgage related assets, and our investment portfolio.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income represented 53 percent of our total revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2018.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the expected average life of our mortgage LHFI and mortgage backed securities and, to a lesser extent, our commercial loans. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in unscheduled prepayments of our loans and mortgage backed securities as borrowers refinance to reduce their own borrowing costs. Conversely, increases in interest rates may decrease loan refinance activity.\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate financial instruments, including certain LHFI, LHFS, and investment securities is affected by changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, the fair value of our fixed-rate financial instruments will generally decline and, therefore, have a negative effect on our financial results. We use derivatives to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy will offset this risk completely.\nAdditionally, the fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on MSR fair value. Conversely, higher rates typically drive lower repayments which result in an increase in the MSR fair value. We utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs. Our risk management strategies, which rely on assumptions or projections, may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, credit spreads or prepayment speeds, and as a result, the change in the fair value of MSRs may negatively impact earnings.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest income or expense.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which oversees LIBOR, formally announced that it could not assure the continued existence of LIBOR in its current form beyond the end of 2021, and that an orderly transition process to one or more alternative benchmarks should begin. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions organized by the Federal Reserve, announced that it had selected a modified version of the unpublished Broad Treasuries Financing Rate as the preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. dollar obligations. This rate, now referred to as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), is based on actual transactions in certain portions of overnight repurchase agreement markets for certain U.S. Treasury obligations, and was first published during the first half of 2018.\nIt is unclear whether, or in what form, LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on our floating rate loans, deposits, obligations, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Additionally, whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a replacement to LIBOR remains in question and it remains uncertain at this time what the impact of a possible transition to SOFR may have on our business, financial result and operations.\nRising interest rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue.\nIn 2018, approximately 47 percent of our revenue was derived from our Mortgage Origination segment which includes activities related to the origination and sales of residential mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Declining interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease. Historically, mortgage origination volume and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors. An increase in interest rates and/or a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. During 2018, average 10 year U.S. Treasury rates, on which we base our pricing of our 30 year mortgages, was 2.91 percent, 58 basis points higher than average rates experienced during 2017. The sustained higher rates experienced throughout 2018 negatively impacted the mortgage market including loan origination volume and refinancing activity.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. Adverse market conditions, including increased volatility and reduced market demand, could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. A prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. Cyclicality in our industry could lead to periods of strong growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of sharp declines and losses in such markets. Seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. One of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans, which is affected by prevailing interest rates, housing supply and demand, residential construction trends, and overall economic conditions. If we are unable to respond to the cyclicality of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo effectively manage our MSR concentration risk we may have to sell our MSRs when market conditions are not optimal or hold MSRs at a level which is punitive to our Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) under Basel III.\nWe are subject to capital standards requirements, including requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and those developed by the Bank's regulators based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III established a qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including limitations on the amount of DTAs and MSRs that may be held without triggering higher capital requirements. Basel III currently limits the amount of MSRs and DTAs each to 10 percent of CET1, individually, and 15 percent of CET1, in the aggregate.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $290 million in MSRs and a MSR to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 23.0 percent. We produced, on average, approximately $89 million of new MSRs per quarter in 2018 and we expect to continue to generate MSRs going forward. Considering the volume of MSRs that we generate, we must continually sell MSRs to manage the concentration of this asset. In 2018, we sold $371 million in MSRs and as of December 31, 2018, we had pending MSR sales with a fair value of $44 million which closed during the first quarter of 2019. While our established plan to manage our MSR concentration incorporates our production volumes and required sales, no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so. Additionally, to manage our MSR concentration, we may have to sell our MSRs at a price less than their fair value due to market constraints present at the time of sale which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn October 27, 2017, the agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) which would simplify certain aspects of the Basel III capital rules. The agencies expect that the capital treatment and transition provisions for items covered by this final rule will change once the simplification proposal is finalized and effective. Specifically, the proposal would increase the limit on MSRs to 25 percent of CET1 and eliminate the aggregate 15 percent CET1 deduction threshold for MSRs and temporary difference DTAs. The increase in the limit on MSRs would allow us to hold up to $347 million in MSRs without being punitive to our capital ratios. The regulators have not yet issued their final rule.\nIn preparation for the NPR, the Basel III implementation phase-in has been halted for the treatment of MSRs and certain DTAs. The agencies issued a final rule that will maintain the capital rules\u2019 2017 transition provisions for several regulatory capital deductions and certain other requirements that are subject to multi-year phase-in schedules in the regulatory capital rules. Specifically, the final rule will maintain the capital rules\u2019 2017 transition provisions at 80 percent for the regulatory capital treatment of the following items: (i) MSRs, (ii) DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, (iii) investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and (iv) minority interests. As of December 31, 2018, we had $290 million on MSRs, $48 million in DTAs arising from temporary differences and no material investments in unconsolidated financial institutions or minority interest. This final rule will maintain the 2017 transition provisions for certain items for non-advanced approach banks, such as the Bank.\nOur ALLL could be too low to sufficiently cover future credit losses. As of December 31, 2018, our ALLL was $128 million, covering 1.4 percent of total loans held-for-investment. Our estimate of the inherent losses is imperfect and based on management judgment.\nOur ALLL, which reflects our estimate of such losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018, may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses. If this allowance is insufficient, future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect\nour financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans, but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business. Our ALLL is based on historical experience as well as our evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is a subjective process that requires significant management judgment, including estimates of loss and the loss emergence period, estimates and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including but not limited to the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate or other collateral backing the repayment of loans. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, failure of borrowers and guarantors to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ALLL. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our ALLL and may recommend or require us to increase the amount of our ALLL, based on their judgment, which may be different from that of our management. Any increase in our loan losses would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment in certain geographic locations and markets may increase the magnitude of potential losses should defaults occur.\nOur residential mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California and Michigan, which comprise approximately 52 percent of the portfolio. In addition, our commercial loan portfolio has a concentration of Michigan lending relationships. Approximately 44 percent of our CRE loans are collateralized by properties in Michigan and 29 percent of our C&I borrowers are located in Michigan. These concentrations have made, and will continue to make, our loan portfolio particularly susceptible to downturns in the local economies and the real estate and mortgage markets in these areas. Adverse conditions that are beyond our control may affect these areas, including unemployment, inflation, recession, natural disasters, declining property values, municipal bankruptcies and other factors which could increase both the probability and severity of defaults in our loan portfolio, reduce our ability to generate new loans and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn 2018, we continued to grow our commercial portfolio to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018. As a part of that, CRE and C&I loans grew to $3.6 billion and comprised 39 percent of our total LHFI portfolio. Additionally, our home builder finance program reached $718 million in outstanding loans at December 31, 2018. The home builder lending portfolio contains secured and unsecured loans and our lending platform originates loans throughout the U.S. with regional offices in Houston and Denver. The growth of our home builder lending business may be impacted by overall economic conditions in the areas builders operate as well as new home construction rates and trends.\nCommercial loans, excluding our warehouse loans, generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans due to the more complex nature of underwriting. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, our largest CRE and C&I borrowers had loans of $71 million and $70 million, respectively. Further, we have commitments up to $100 million in our CRE and C&I portfolios. As such, a default by one of our larger borrowers could result in a significant loss relative to our ALLL. Additionally, secured loans, including residential and commercial real estate, may experience changes in the underlying collateral value due to adverse market conditions which could result in increased charge-offs in the event of a loan default.\nAt December 31, 2018, our adjustable-rate warehouse lines of credit granted to other mortgage lenders was $3.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding. There may be risks associated with the mortgage lenders that borrow from the Bank, including credit risk, inadequate underwriting, and potential external fraud. At December 31, 2018, our largest borrower had an outstanding advance of $80 million. A default by one of our larger warehouse borrowers could result in a large loss. Additionally, adverse changes to industry competition, mortgage demand and the interest rate environment may have a negative impact on warehouse lending.\nLiquidity risk may affect our ability to meet obligations and impact our ability to grow our business.\nWe require substantial liquidity to repay our customers' deposits, fulfill loan demand, meet borrowing obligations as they come due, and fund our operations under both normal operating environments and unforeseen circumstances causing liquidity stress. Our liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of deposits. Our access to liquidity, including deposits, as well as the cost of that liquidity, is dependent on various factors, a number of which could make funding more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms. These factors include: losses or declining financial results, material changes to operating margins, financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers, changes within the organization, specific events that impact our financial condition or reputation, disruptions in the capital\nmarkets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, the corporate and regulatory structure, balance sheet and capital structure, geographic and business diversification, interest rate fluctuations, market share and competitive position, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. A material deterioration in any one or a combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties or a decline in our reputation within the marketplace, and could result in higher cash outflows requiring additional access to liquidity, having a limited ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits (including custodial deposits from our agency servicing portfolio) or to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to maintain and grow certain of these financing arrangements, are restricted from accessing certain funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on acceptable terms, or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to limit our growth, reduce the number of loans we are able to originate or take actions that could have other negative effects on our operations.\nWe are a holding company and are, therefore, dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank and cash on hand, our ability to service our debt, including interest payments on our senior notes and trust preferred securities, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay for certain services we purchase from the Bank and cover operating expenses, depend upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The holding company had cash and cash equivalents of $201 million at December 31, 2018, or approximately 3.2 years of future cash outflows, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt service coverage when excluding the redemption of $250 million of senior notes which mature on July 15, 2021. On January 29, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with Wells Fargo, N.A. to repurchase up to $50 million of the Company's common stock. Operating expenses, which include costs paid to the Bank, totaled $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The declaration and payment of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the Bank's Board of Directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations. If the Bank, does not, or cannot, make sufficient dividend payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or could cause us to take other actions which could be materially detrimental.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe are highly dependent on the Agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate. Changes in these entities or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately 50 percent of our mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may materially adversely affect our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. Their roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements. The elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the servicing, origination, or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way that we originate, underwrite, or service. Agency loans, including guidelines with respect to credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, our modification standards and procedures and the amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms with the Agencies and they are subject to change at any time. A significant change in these guidelines which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage\nservices could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon having FDIC insurance to raise deposit funding at reasonable rates. Future changes in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution's deposit insurance premiums. Consequently, the FDIC has defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average Tier 1 Capital. Our assessment rate is determined by use of a scorecard that combines our CAMELS ratings with certain other financial information. Changes in the level and mix of these financial components in the scorecard may result in a higher assessment rate. The FDIC may determine that we present a higher risk to the DIF than other banks due to various factors. These factors include significant risks relating to interest rates, loan portfolio and geographic concentration, concentration of high credit risk loans, increased loan losses, regulatory compliance, existing and future litigation and other factors. As a result, we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings. The Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future also may be higher than competing banks may be required to pay. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our FDIC insurance expense premiums totaled $22 million, $16 million and $11 million, respectively.\nOperational Risk\nOur recent acquisition of bank branches from Wells Fargo involves integration and other risks.\nBank branch acquisitions involve a number of challenges including, the ability to integrate new business into operations, internal controls and regulatory functions. There is no assurance we will be able to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches or attract new deposits and generate new interest-earning assets in geographic areas we did not previously serve. There is no guarantee that the acquired branches will achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business; that we will compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches; or that we will manage any growth resulting from the transaction effectively. We face the additional risk that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or within the time period expected.\nA failure of our information technology systems, or those of any of our key third party vendors or service providers, could cause operational losses and damage our reputation.\nOur businesses are increasingly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions and data. If our internal information technology systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business for a period of time, which may impact our financial results if that interruption is sustained. In addition, our reputation with our customers or business partners may suffer, which could have a further, long-term impact on our financial results.\nBecause we conduct part of our business over the Internet and outsource a significant number of our critical functions to third parties, our operations depend on our third-party service providers to maintain and operate their own technology systems. To the extent these third parties\u2019 systems fail, despite our monitoring and contingency plans, we may be unable to conduct business or provide certain services, and we may face financial and reputational losses as a result.\nWe face operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value of transactions we process.\nWe rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a wide variety of transactions. Many of the transactions we process may be of high dollar value, such as those related to mortgage lending and warehouse advances. In 2018, we originated a total of $32.5 billion in residential mortgage loans and processed $33.9 billion of warehouse lending advances. We face operational risk from, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties, compliance failures, cyber-attacks, technology failures, or unforeseen problems related to system implementations or upgrades, business continuation and disaster recovery issues, and other external\nevents. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a financial loss, regulatory action or damage to our reputation.\nWe may lose market share to our competitors if we are not able to respond to technological change and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technologically driven. We may not be able to respond to technological innovations as quickly as our competitors do. Certain of our competitors are making significantly greater investments and allocating significantly more in financial resources toward technological innovations than we historically have. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers and introduce competitive products in a cost-efficient manner depends on our responsiveness to technological advances, investment in new technology as it becomes available, and obtaining and maintaining related essential personnel. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products by financial technology companies and platforms may adversely affect our ability to maintain our customer base, obtain new customers or successfully grow our business. The failure to respond to the product demands of our customers, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect, store and transfer our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information. Any cybersecurity attack or other compromise to the security of that information could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nCybersecurity related attacks are attempted on an ongoing basis which pose a risk of data breaches relative to the processing of consumer transactions that contain customers\u2019 personally identifiable information. As a part of conducting business, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data either on our network or in the cloud.\nCybersecurity risks for banking institutions have increased significantly in recent years due to new technologies, the reliance on technology to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. A cybersecurity attack or information security breach could adversely impact our ability to conduct business due to the potential costs for remediation, protection and litigation and reputational damage with customers, business partners and investors.\nThere are myriad federal, state, local and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. We have policies and processes in place that are intended to meet the requirements of those laws, including security systems to prevent unauthorized access to that information. Nevertheless, those processes and systems may be inadequate. Also, to the extent we rely upon third parties to handle personally identifiable data on our behalf, we may be responsible if such data is compromised or subject to a cybersecurity attack while in the custody and control of those third parties.\nPrivacy laws are continually evolving and many state and local jurisdictions have laws that differ from federal law or privacy policies, further some of those policies or laws may conflict. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state, local or international laws and regulations or experience any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, those events could damage the reputation of our business, and discourage potential users from utilizing our products and services. In addition, we may have to bear the cost of mitigating identity theft concerns, and may be subject to fines or legal proceedings by governmental agencies or consumers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nServicing revenue makes up approximately 11 percent of our total revenue and contributed approximately $1.8 billion in average custodial deposits during 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had relationships with 7 owners of MSRs, excluding ourselves, in which we act as servicer or subservicer for the mortgage loans they own. Due to the limited number of relationships, discontinuation of existing agreements with any of those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue. The terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and, in some instances, could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause. Additionally, the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and, to the extent allowable, could choose to transfer the oversight of the Bank's custodial deposits to another depository institution. Further, as servicer or subservicer of loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a\nmaterial breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold by us, we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, about the mortgage loans, and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower or we may be required to pay fees. We also are subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties which may result in significant costs. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit or other losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense. We may incur significant costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and, as a result, our profitability.\nOur representation and warranty reserve, which is based on an estimate of probable future losses, was $7 million at December 31, 2018. This may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. Our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our representation and warranty reserve for losses. Our regulators may recommend or require us to increase our reserve, based on their judgment, which may differ from that of our management. The repurchase demand pipeline was $9 million UPB at December 31, 2018.\nWe utilize third party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and operational risk.\nIn 2018, approximately 86 percent of our residential first mortgage volume depended upon the use of third party mortgage originators, i.e. mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages and provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with or loyalties to such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on third party mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate. While we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business and review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank.\nDue to regulatory scrutiny, our third party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule issued by the CFPB establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms, timing of communicating information to borrowers and certain record keeping requirements. The ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs. In addition, these arrangements with third party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and restrictions in the future.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, prohibit discriminatory lending practices by lenders, including financial institutions. Mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated. As we originate loans through various channels, we, and our third party mortgage originators, are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of or disparate impact to borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, by us or our third party mortgage originators, could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMP Thrift, an entity managed and controlled by MatlinPatterson, owns 47.8 percent of our common stock. Future issuance of Flagstar\u2019s common stock in the public market, or as a result of actions taken by MP Thrift, could adversely affect the trading price of Flagstar\u2019s common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, MP Thrift owned 47.8 percent of the Company\u2019s common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Flagstar\u2019s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, may cause the market price of Flagstar\u2019s common stock to decline. Further, a large quantity of our shares introduced into the market, either at once or over time, could increase the supply of Flagstar common stock, thereby putting pressure on our stock price. Pricing pressure could further be exacerbated by low trading volumes and market conditions, both of which may impact the extent of time it may take for pricing to rationalize.\nWe are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings.\nAt any given time, we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of the routine reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve consumer protection, employment, tort, and numerous other laws and regulations. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities, or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our business. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to stockholder derivative actions, which could seek significant damages or other relief. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations.\nIn 2018, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that California state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not, as a matter of law, preempted by the National Bank Act (Lusnak v. Bank of America). This ruling goes against the position that regulators, national banks and other federally-chartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of state-law mortgage escrow interest requirements. The opinion issued by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western United States. If the Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s holding is more broadly adopted by other Federal Circuits, including those covering states that currently have or in the future may enact statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively apply interest on escrows, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. For further information, see Note 21 - Legal Proceedings, Contingencies and Commitments.\nLoss of certain personnel, including key members of the Corporation's management team, could adversely affect the Corporation.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon our management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulations that allow us to make severance payments only in limited circumstances. Our named executive officers may be entitled to certain severance and change in control benefits. Although we follow certain leading practices with respect to executive compensation including the elimination of supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) or other nonqualified plans for executives and avoiding severance payments for \"cause\" terminations or voluntary resignations, we may be subject to certain legal or regulatory risks associated with previous employment agreements or retirement plans which could impact our liabilities and results of operations related to these matters.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described herein or in any such report or document.", "PERMNO": 84734, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FBC"}
