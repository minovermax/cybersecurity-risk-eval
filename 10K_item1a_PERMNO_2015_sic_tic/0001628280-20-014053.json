{"cik": "914712", "company": "Steel Connect, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.- RISK FACTORS\nOur businesses are subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect us. It should be recognized that other risks may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent than indicated. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you many lose all or part of your investment.\nForward-looking statements in this document and those we make from time to time through our senior management are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements concerning the expected future revenue or earnings or concerning projected plans, performance, or development of products and services, as well as other estimates related to future operations are necessarily only estimates of future results. We cannot assure you that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements represent our current expectations and are inherently uncertain. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of clients, and negative industry trends or the loss of one or more of any of those clients could adversely impact our business.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue by providing supply chain management services and marketing solutions to a small number of clients. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 57% and 49% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. One client, associated with the Supply Chain segment, accounted for 17% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Our business and future growth will continue to depend in large part on direct mail remaining a critical piece of customers' marketing spend, as well as, the industry trend towards outsourcing supply chain management and other business processes. If these trends do not continue or decline, demand for marketing solutions and our supply chain management services will decline, and our financial results could suffer. In addition, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could cause our revenue and or profits to decline and our financial results could suffer.\nIn general, we do not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from us, or to designate us as its sole supplier of any particular services. If any of our key clients fail to respond successfully to market shifts, we would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods.\nWe may have difficulty achieving and sustaining operating profitability, and if we deplete our working capital balances, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reported operating income (losses) of $32.4 million and $(25.3) million, respectively. Although we have reduced our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant fixed operating expenses in the future, including both cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Therefore, since our revenue is subject to fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain operating income in the future. We may also use significant amounts of cash in an effort to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business. At July 31, 2020, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of approximately $75.9 million and current liabilities of approximately $249.9 million. If we are unable to achieve or sustain operating profitability, we risk depleting our working capital balances, and our business will be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our contracts do not contain minimum purchase requirements and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by clients, which could decrease revenue and materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to demand variability by our clients, which is difficult to predict, has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate, sometimes materially from year to year and even from quarter to quarter. The level and timing of\norders placed by these clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users for the Supply Chain business, as well as, individual client strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions impacting both of our operating segments. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of their products or insufficient capacity in our sites, or in the alternative, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe Supply Chain business conducts business outside of the U.S., which may expose the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely in the U.S.\nThe majority of ModusLink's business and operations are in foreign countries, including China, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Singapore. These operations have additional risks, including risks relating to currency exchange, difficulties and limitations on the repatriation of cash, less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, differences in the legal and regulatory environment, different publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets, economic and political risks, and possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes. There can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our operations in certain countries.\nModusLink also faces several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, U.S. laws such as export control laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries.\nIn addition, our business in China faces additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in China by foreign companies;\n\u2022\nprotection of intellectual property, both for us and our clients;\n\u2022\nevolving regulatory systems and standards, including recent tax law and labor law changes;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining management personnel and skilled employees; and\n\u2022\nexpiration of tax holidays.\nRecent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our operations.\nThe federal government has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, taxes, government regulations and tariffs. The current U.S. presidential administration has signaled support for implementing and, in some instances, has already proposed or taken action with respect to major changes to certain trade policies in an effort to encourage U.S. production, including tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, Canada and other countries. Additionally, the federal government has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods and may consider other measures. These trade conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our operating costs, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our Supply Chain business revenue comes from clients in the technology and consumer products sectors, which is intensely competitive, very volatile and subject to rapid changes. A large portion of our Direct Marketing business revenue is generated from clients in the insurance, MSO, financial services and subscription services products sectors, which may be subject to fluctuations in overall economic conditions. Declines in the overall performance of the technology and consumer products sectors have in the past and could in the future, adversely affect the demand for supply chain management\nservices and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. In addition, industry changes, such as the transition of more collateral materials from physical form to digital form, the convergence of functionality of smart phones and change in marketing channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services or devices we currently handle. The recent uncertainty in the economy and other factors have resulted in decreased demand for our clients' products and reduction in demand for our marketing solutions, which have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely on a quarterly basis during the last several years and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n\u2022\nimplementation of our strategic initiatives and achievement of expected results of these initiatives;\n\u2022\ndemand for our services;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence and demand;\n\u2022\nspecific economic conditions in the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product introductions or software releases by our clients or their competitors;\n\u2022\npayment of costs associated with our acquisitions, sales of assets and investments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\ntemporary shortages in supply from vendors;\n\u2022\ncharges for impairment of long-lived assets, including restructuring in future periods;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, including changes in tariff laws or natural disasters in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions and estimates reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor laws;\n\u2022\navailability of labor resources and the variability of available rates for labor resources;\n\u2022\nunionization of our labor and contract labor; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of automation.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful or indicative of our future performance. In some fiscal quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe must maintain adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs, which present risks to our financial position and operating results.\nWe must purchase and maintain adequate levels of inventory (including adequate levels of paper inventory used by IWCO) in order to meet client needs on a timely basis. The markets, including the technology sector served by many of our clients, are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced product specification requirements, and evolving industry standards. These changes may cause inventory on hand to decline substantially in value or to rapidly become obsolete. The majority of our clients in the Supply Chain business offer protection from the loss in value of inventory. However, our clients may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their protection obligations, and the inability of our clients to fulfill their protection obligations could lower our gross margins and cause us to record inventory write-downs. In our Direct Marketing business, our clients typically do not provide such price protection. If we are unable to manage the inventory on hand with our clients with a high degree of precision, we may have insufficient product supplies or we may have excess inventory, resulting in inventory write-downs, which may harm our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or components in the quantities required to fulfill client orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our suppliers. We may occasionally experience a supply shortage of some products as a result of strong demand or problems experienced by our suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of those products may increase, or the products may not be available at all. Accordingly, an inability to secure and maintain an adequate supply of products, packaging materials or components to fulfill our client orders on a timely basis, or a failure to meet clients' expectations, could result in lost revenue, lower client satisfaction, negative perceptions in the marketplace, potential claims for damages and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may encounter problems in our efforts to increase operational efficiencies.\nBecause the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, we continue to seek to identify ways to increase efficiencies and productivity and effect cost savings. IWCO and ModusLink are continually employing programs to achieve efficiencies, which include investment in capital equipment and automation. We cannot assure you that these projects and investment in capital will result in the realization of the expected benefits that we anticipate in a timely manner or at all. We may encounter problems with these projects that will divert the attention of management and/or result in additional costs and unforeseen project delays. If we, or these projects, do not achieve expected results, our business, financial position and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition to already undertaken projects in our Supply Chain business designed to increase our operational efficiencies, including the standardization to a global solutions platform through an integrated ERP system and the implementation of a model utilizing centralized \"hub\" locations to service multiple \"spoke\" locations across the Americas, Asia and Europe regions, our executive team is continuing its review across the organization designed to improve our operations, including a commitment to automate certain facilities.\nLoss of essential employees or an inability to recruit and retain personnel could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our management and other employees. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with essential skills could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to retain or attract talented, committed individuals to fill vacant positions when needs arise, it may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. We do not currently maintain \"key persons\" insurance on our senior management. In particular, IWCO's production operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled and unskilled employees to take advantage of all available manufacturing capacity and ensure on-time delivery of clients' marketing programs to meet service level agreements (SLAs) without penalty. IWCO's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote personnel for all areas of its organization. Also, IWCO's sales executives, the majority of which have at least 10 years' industry experience, are focused on specific industry verticals leveraging their expertise to drive clients marketing results. Labor market conditions may have an adverse impact on profitability and ability to deliver product on time. Any material increases in employee turnover rates could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. IWCO is exploring automation and efficiency options to reduce its reliance on direct labor.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development, impact of costs associated with business combinations and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in share-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes;\n\u2022\nincreases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nthe expiration of tax holidays.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.\nThe gross margins in the Supply Chain business are low, which magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our financial results.\nAs a result of intense price competition in the technology products and consumer products marketplaces, the gross margins in our Supply Chain business are low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the future. These low gross margins magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our financial results. Increased competition arising from industry consolidation and/or low demand for products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins. Portions of our operating expenses are relatively fixed, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Our\ncurrent ability to forecast the amount and timing of future order volumes is difficult, and we expect this to continue because we are highly dependent upon the business needs of our clients, which are highly variable. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins. We may also be required to spend money to restructure our operations should future demand fall significantly in one or more facilities. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in response to competitive price pressures, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily. Numerous well-established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our offerings. The market for supply chain management products and services, as well as marketing solutions, is very competitive, and the intensity of the competition is expected to continue to increase. Any failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to maintain and increase market share, which could result in serious harm to our business. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors will continue to have greater financial, technical, operational and marketing resources. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors. Competitive pressures may also force prices for our products and services down, and these price reductions may reduce our revenue. The competition we face may also increase as a result of consolidation within the supply chain management and logistics, and marketing solutions industries. For example, if as a result of consolidation, our competitors are able to obtain more favorable terms from their suppliers, offer more comprehensive services to their customers, or otherwise take actions that increase their competitive strengths, our competitive position and therefore our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nThe physical or intellectual property of our clients may be damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost while in our possession, subjecting us to litigation and other adverse consequences.\nIn the course of providing supply chain management services to our clients, we often have possession of or access to their physical and intellectual property, including consigned inventory, databases, software masters, certificates of authenticity and similar valuable physical or intellectual property. If this physical or intellectual property is damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost, we could suffer: claims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages; delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction; negative publicity; and litigation that could be costly and time consuming.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information and operational technology systems in the conduct of our business to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. In some cases, we may rely upon third-party providers of hosting, support and other services to meet our information technology requirements. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. Upgrading our information technology systems is costly and subject to delay, and there is no assurance new systems will provide the benefits expected. We may also experience operational problems attributable to the installation, implementation, integration, performance, features or functionality of third-party software, systems and services.\nIn addition, our information and operational technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, defects in design, employee malfeasance, and human or technological errors. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, use of malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or control of automated production systems, and other security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various procedures and controls to monitor, deter and mitigate these threats have been implemented. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of technology security incidents and disruptions, our businesses could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, reputation or results of operations. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems or networks, yet none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition. Further, any failure by our hosting and support partners or other third-party service providers in the performance of their services could materially harm our business. While\nwe maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is adequate for our business, such coverage may not cover all potential costs and expenses associated with any security incidents that may occur in the future.\nA breach of our information technology systems could also result in the misappropriation of intellectual property, business plans or trade secrets. Any failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access or acquisition of such proprietary information, and any actual or perceived security breach could cause significant damage to our reputation, expose us to liability or regulatory enforcement action and adversely impact our relationships with our customers. Additionally, while our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and information systems, accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities or our information systems could lead to misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information.\nIf any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client, customer or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. State and federal laws may also require us to provide notice to affected individuals if their personal data is the subject of a breach in security, which would impose costs and could lead to additional liability and negative publicity.\nWe take cybersecurity and data privacy seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and to prevent unwanted intrusions and disclosures, in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations addressing cybersecurity and data privacy. In particular, we have put in place policies and procedures to address the European General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020. However, these security and compliance efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate such cyber-attacks or security breaches. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems, regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.\nThe funds held for clients may be subject to credit risk.\nIn the course of providing certain supply chain services to our clients, we at times have possession of client funds. The funds are maintained at financial institutions, and the balances associated with these funds are at times without or in excess of federally insured limits. If these funds are impaired, misappropriated or stolen, we could suffer: claims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages; delayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction; negative publicity; and litigation that could be costly and time consuming.\nWe may not be able to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions and achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe can complement our current business activities, both financially and strategically. Acquisitions involve many complexities and inherent risk, including, but not limited to: failure to achieve all or any projected synergies or other intended benefits of the acquisition; failure to integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services; substantial unanticipated integration costs; loss of key employees, including those of the acquired business; additional debt and/or assumption of unknown liabilities; loss of customers; and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, there is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses.\nOTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, \"NOLs\" or \"Tax Benefits\").\nOur past operations generated significant net operating losses (\"NOLs\"). The Company has net NOL carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $2.1 billion and $117.0 million, respectively, at July 31, 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which among, other things, amends the treatment of NOLs. Under federal tax laws, for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid in our prior two tax years or on our future taxable income for up to 20 years, at which point they \"expire\" for such purposes. Until\nthey expire, we can \"carry forward\" NOLs and certain related tax credits that we do not use in any particular year to offset taxable income in future years. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, we are allowed to carryback such NOLs to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses and generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely. In addition, the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80 percent of our taxable income for any tax year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction). NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, are referred to herein as \"Current NOLs.\" We cannot estimate the exact amount of NOLs that we will be able use to reduce future income tax liability because we cannot predict the amount and timing of our future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\" or \"Internal Revenue Code\"). Under Section 382, an \"ownership change\" occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders that each owns (or is deemed to own) at least 5% of our common stock increases their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change is deemed to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 could significantly limit our ability to use our NOLs to reduce future income tax liability and result in a material amount of our Current NOLs expiring unused and, therefore, significantly impair the value of our NOLs.\nOur ability to use our Current NOLs in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state taxable income in future years to use the Current NOLs before they expire, we will lose the benefit of the Current NOLs permanently. In addition to the generation of future federal and state taxable income, our ability to use our Current NOLs will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and once identified, successfully consummating an acquisition of or investment in these candidates.\nIn early 2018, Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") adopted an amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Protective Amendment\") and a tax benefit preservation plan (\"Tax Plan\"), each designed to preserve the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs, by preventing an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would impair the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs. On April 12, 2018, at the Annual Meeting of Steel Connect's stockholders (the \"2017 Annual Meeting\"), the stockholders of Steel Connect approved the Protective Amendment and Tax Plan, and Steel Connect filed the Protective Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nThe Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. In addition to a prohibited transfer being void as of the date it is attempted, upon demand, the purported transferee must transfer the excess stock to an agent of the Company along with any dividends or other distributions paid with respect to such excess stock. The agent is required to sell such excess stock in an arm's-length transaction (or series of transactions) that would not constitute a violation under the Protective Amendment.\nAs part of the plan Tax Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one right (a \"Right\") for each share of common stock then outstanding. The dividend was payable to holders of record as of the close of business on January 29, 2018. Any shares of common stock issued after January 29, 2018, will be issued together with the Rights. Each Right initially represents the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of newly created Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\nInitially, the Rights were attached to all certificates representing shares of common stock then outstanding, and no separate rights certificates were distributed. In the case of book entry shares, the Rights are evidenced by notations in the book entry accounts. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Tax Plan, the Rights will separate from the common stock and a distribution date (the \"Distribution Date\") will occur upon the earlier of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement that a stockholder (or group) has become a beneficial owner of 4.99-percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding and (ii) ten (10) business days (or such later date as the Board determines) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming a 4.99-percent stockholder.\nPursuant to the Tax Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99-percent stockholder after adoption of the Tax Plan, the Rights would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the new 4.99-percent stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination after a non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a new 4.99-percent stockholder, each holder of the Right (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company's common stock at a discount.\nThe Protective Amendment does not expire. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the earliest of (i) 11:59 p.m., on January 18, 2021; (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged as provided in the Tax Plan; and (iii) the time at which the Board determines that the Tax Plan is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of the NOLs. The Company's Board of Directors is currently considering whether to adopt another tax benefit preservation plan in light of the upcoming expiration of the Rights under the Tax Plan.\nThe amount of NOLs that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOLs or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOLs to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOLs to us could be substantially reduced.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign tax audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to income taxes and for various other taxes, including but not limited to value added tax, or VAT, excise tax, sales and use tax, gross receipts tax and property tax. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties, if our positions are not accepted by the auditing tax authority.\nWe may be subject to state sales taxes that we have not paid, collected from our customers or reserved for on our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. We are evaluating our state tax filings with respect to the recent Wayfair decision and prior regulations, and are in the process of reviewing our collection practices. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to our operations, and if such changes were made, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have problems raising or accessing capital we need in the future.\nIn recent years, we have financed our operations and met our capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of our securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of Company owned facilities that were not being fully utilized. These funding sources may not be sufficient in the future, and we may need to obtain additional funding from outside sources, however, we may not be able to obtain such funding. In addition, even if we obtain outside funding sources, we may be required to issue to those outside sources securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of our common stock. We may also be required to take other actions, which may lessen the value of our common stock or dilute our common stockholders, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us or issuing additional shares of common stock. If we experience difficulties raising capital in the future, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, market and other conditions largely beyond our control may affect our ability to engage in future sales of our securities, the timing of any sales and the amount of proceeds we receive from sales of our securities. Even if we are able to sell our securities in the future, we may not be able to sell at favorable prices or on favorable terms. As long as our public float is less than $75 million, we will be limited in selling our securities on a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to offerings that do not exceed one-third of our public float in a rolling 12-month period. Therefore, the process of raising capital to support our growth may be more expensive and time consuming, including the use of a registration statement on Form S-1, and the\nterms of any offering transaction may not be as favorable as they would have been if we were eligible to use Form S-3 without these restrictions. In addition to entailing increased capital costs, any such transactions could result in substantial dilution of our stockholders' interests, transfer control to a new investor and diminish the value of an investment in our common stock.\nWe may also need to pursue strategic transactions, such as joint ventures, private placements or the sale of our business or all or substantially all of our assets. These private financings and strategic transactions could in the future require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our financial results, be unsuccessful or fail to achieve the desired results. We are in discussions from time to time with such possible sources of additional funding.\nIf financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to pose risks, to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The spread of the outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, and economists expect the impact will be significant during the next year. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to evaluate the global risks and the slowdown in business activity related to COVID-19, including the potential impacts on its employees, customers, suppliers and financial results. For the fiscal year 2020, COVID-19 required temporary closures of certain of ModusLink's facilities. Additionally, although IWCO operated as an essential business, it had reduced operating levels and labor shifts due to lower sales volume.\nCurrently, the Company anticipates that the impact of the rapid deterioration of the U.S and global economies will most likely continue and have an adverse impact on the Company's business. However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, it is difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic and the impact on the Company's business, operations, financial condition and cash flows. The severity of the impact on the Company's business beyond fiscal year 2020 will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the extent and severity of the impact on the Company's customers and suppliers, the continued disruption to the demand for our businesses' products and services, and the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company's future results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivables beyond normal payment terms, supply chain disruptions and uncertain demand, and the effect of any initiatives or programs that the Company may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by its customers. There is also no certainty that federal, state or local regulations regarding safety measures to address the spread of COVID-19 will not adversely impact the Company's operations.\nThe Company's results of operations, including sales volume, were adversely affected by COVID-19 during the fiscal year 2020, and the Company currently anticipates that the impact of the rapid deterioration of the U.S and global economies will most likely continue and have an adverse impact on the Company's business. The COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases could materially adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in several ways. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\u2022\nimpair the Company's ability to manage day-to-day service and product delivery;\n\u2022\ncontinue to impact customer demand of our businesses' products and services;\n\u2022\ncause disruptions in or closures of the Company's operations or those of its customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\ncause the Company to experience an increase in costs as a result of the Company's emergency measures, delayed payments from customers and uncollectible accounts;\n\u2022\ncause delays and disruptions in the supply chain resulting in disruptions in the commercial operation of our businesses;\n\u2022\ncause limitations on the Company's employees' ability to work and travel;\n\u2022\nimpact availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nincrease cybersecurity risks as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\ncause other unpredictable events.\nAs the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, it is difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic and the impact on the Company's business, operations, financial condition and cash flows. The severity of the impact on the Company's business in fiscal 2021 and beyond will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the extent and severity of the impact on the Company's customers and suppliers, the continued disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our businesses' products and services, the effect of federal, state or local regulations regarding safety measures to address the spread of COVID-19, and the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of this event, the Company cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact the Company's business, results and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are not known at this time. The Company is staying in close communication with its employees, customers and suppliers, and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, but there is no guarantee the Company will be able to do so.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On April 28, 2020, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock has not been maintained at the minimum required closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \"Minimum Bid Price Rule\"). The Nasdaq letter is a notice of deficiency, not delisting, and has no immediate effect on the Nasdaq listing or trading of the Company's common stock.\nGiven the extraordinary market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nasdaq determined to toll the compliance periods for the Minimum Bid Price Rule and the market value of publicly held shares requirement through June 30, 2020 (the \"Tolling Period\").\nThe Company may regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule during the Tolling Period, or in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, during the 180 calendar day period from July 1, 2020 to December 28, 2020. If at any time through December 28, 2020, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that it complies with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by December 28, 2020, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance of up to an additional 180 calendar days ending June 27, 2021 if it satisfies the conditions for and completes a transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company believes that it will be eligible to satisfy these conditions for a transfer.\nThe Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock between now and December 28, 2020, and, if applicable, June 27, 2021, and to take reasonable measures to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. During the applicable cure periods, the Company also intends to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market, to the extent that the Company transfers to obtain a second 180-day cure period ending June 27, 2021. While the Company plans to review all available options, there can be no assurance that it will be able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If the Company were to receive a delisting determination after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, it would be permitted to appeal the determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, and its common stock would remain listed pending the panel's decision after the hearing. If the Company did not succeed in such an appeal, its common stock would be removed from trading on Nasdaq, pending further review at the Company's option by a Nasdaq Listing Council.\nThe perception among investors that the Company is at heightened risk of delisting could negatively affect the market price of our securities and trading volume of the Company's common stock. Additionally, any delisting determination could seriously decrease or eliminate the value of an investment in the Company's common stock. While an alternative listing on an over-the-counter exchange could maintain some degree of a market in the Company's common stock, we could face substantial material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, among other things: limited availability for market quotations for the Company's common stock; reduced liquidity with respect to the Company's common stock; a determination that the Company's common stock is a \"penny stock\" under SEC rules, subjecting brokers trading the Company's common stock to more stringent rules on disclosure and the class of investors to which the broker may sell the common stock; and limited news and analyst coverage.\nSPH Group Holdings LLC and its affiliates own a majority of the voting power of our capital stock and have significant influence over our corporate decisions.\nAs of July 31, 2020, SPH Group Holdings LLC (\"SPHG Holdings\") and its affiliates, including Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (\"Steel Holdings\"), Handy & Harman Ltd. and Steel Partners, Ltd., beneficially owned approximately 48.8% of our outstanding capital stock, including 17,857,143 shares of common stock underlying Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\"), which vote on an as-converted basis together with our common stock, and 6,293,707 shares of common stock underlying a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024, which do not vote on an as-converted basis together with our common stock. In addition, as of July 31, 2020, a Section 13(d) group made of SPHG Holdings and certain of its affiliates, collectively owned 55.3% of our outstanding capital stock, representing 51.9% of the voting power of our capital stock.\nAs a result of this board representation and ownership of our capital stock, SPHG Holdings and its affiliates are able to influence our management and affairs and many matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the passage of a tax benefits preservation plan and certain amendments to our organizational documents. In addition, because a business combination, such as a merger or consolidation, requires the affirmative vote of 75% of our outstanding voting stock, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. SPHG Holdings and its affiliates may also have interests that are different from other shareholders and may vote in a way that may be adverse to our other stockholders' interests, and conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of SPHG Holdings and its affiliates. See Note 21 for additional information.\nMembers of our Board also have significant interests in Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which may create conflicts of interest.\nSome members of our Board also hold positions with Steel Holdings and its affiliates. Specifically, Warren G. Lichtenstein, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, is affiliated with Steel Holdings and is now the Executive Chairman of Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. (\"Steel Holdings GP\"). Glen Kassan, our Vice Chairman of the Board and former Chief Administrative Officer, is an employee of Steel Services. Jack L. Howard, a director, is the President and a director of Steel Holdings GP. See our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed on June 29, 2020 for full biographical information for Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kassan and Howard.\nAs a result, these individuals may face potential conflicts of interest with each other and with our stockholders. They may be presented with situations in their capacity as our directors that conflict with their fiduciary obligations to Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which in turn may have interests that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties' conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting SPHG Holdings and affiliates.\nLitigation pending against us could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently a party to various legal and other proceedings. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders or employees, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could result in material damages and/or other expenses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation.\nThe existence of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the Company. While we have remediated the previously-identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the value of our common stock could suffer from our initial identification of such material weakness, and we may identify other material weaknesses in the future.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, management concluded that there was a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting with respect to the Company's information technology general controls. Specifically, it was identified that there was a lack of segregation of duties due to the number of users who maintained administrative access and super user access rights and lack of controls related to change management and monitoring program changes related to the ERP system at IWCO. Since our management first concluded that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we have taken certain measures to improve our applicable controls, and as of July 31, 2020, the material weakness was remediated. For more information on our remediation efforts and these management determinations, see Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.\nAlthough we believe we remediated the material weakness and our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of July 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that our controls will remain adequate or not suffer from other material weaknesses as conditions change or our compliance with policies and procedures evolves over time. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including judgments used in decision-making, the nature and complexity of the transactions we undertake, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems and cost limitations. Moreover, the trading price of our common stock could suffer from any lasting impact from this past identification of a material weakness or identification of a material weaknesses in the future. These could include regulatory inquiries, enforcement actions or litigation, decreased confidence from investors or difficulty in finding investors or financial institutions to assist us in raising capital.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nAs of July 31, 2020, the carrying value of the debt outstanding was approximately $379.0 million, which was comprised of $371.0 million term loan due December 15, 2022 and $8.1 million of 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due March 1, 2024.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, some which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, meet working capital requirements and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. See Liquidity and Capital Resources contained in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, our debt agreements require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe debt agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will restrict our operational flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under the debt agreements.\nThe debt agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants, including with regard to specified financial ratios, that limit and restrict our operations and may hamper our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these and other covenants under the debt agreements. Our failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings, and shareholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of our creditors on our assets.\nChanges in reference interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIn addition to this, LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The Company typically uses LIBOR as a reference rate in the Company's credit facilities such that the interest due to our lenders is calculated using LIBOR. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist, if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if replacement conventions will be developed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR is uncertain. At this time, due to a lack of consensus existing as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the Company's liquidity or interest expense. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may need to renegotiate its credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.", "PERMNO": 80114, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "STCN"}
