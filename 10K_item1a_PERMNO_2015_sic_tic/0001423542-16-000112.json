{"cik": "1423542", "company": "SKULLCANDY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, which address the material risks concerning our business, together with the other information contained in this annual report. If any of the risks discussed in this annual report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose part or all of your investment. Some statements in this annual report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the initial paragraph of this annual report entitled \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nWe may be unable to achieve future growth, which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nDuring 2015 net sales increased $18.5 million or 7.5%, to $266.3 million compared to 2014. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue the increase in our net sales. Our future success will depend upon various factors, including the strength of our brand image, market demand for our current and future products, competitive conditions, and compatibility of our products with portable media devices and smartphones and the implementation of our growth strategy. We intend to finance our anticipated growth through cash flows generated from sales to our retailers and distributors. However, if our net sales decline, we may not have the cash flow necessary to pursue our growth strategy.\nIf our design and marketing efforts do not effectively raise the recognition and reputation of our brands, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy.\nWe believe that our ability to raise the recognition and favorable perception of our brands is critical to implement our growth strategy, which includes further penetrating our domestic retail channel, accelerating our international growth and expanding complementary product categories. To extend the reach of our brands, we believe we must devote significant time and resources to product design, marketing and promotions. These expenditures, however, may not result in a sufficient increase in net sales to cover such expenses. Furthermore, we must balance our growth with the effect it has on the authenticity of our brand. For example, our credibility and brand image could be weakened if our consumers perceive our distribution channels to be too broad or our retailers to not fit with our lifestyle image. If any of these events occur, our consumer base and our net sales may decline and we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop innovative and popular products, our brand image may be harmed and demand for our products may decrease.\nConsumer electronics and youth culture lifestyle are subject to constantly and rapidly changing consumer preferences based on industry trends and performance features. Our success depends largely on our ability to lead, anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences and trends in a timely manner, while preserving and strengthening the perception and authenticity of our brand. We must continue to develop innovative, trend-setting and stylish products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors. Market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty and we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful. The inability of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could adversely affect our brand image, our business and financial condition. Achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to increase consumer demand, which could constrain our management, financial and operational resources. If new products we introduce do not experience broad market acceptance or demand for our existing products wanes, our net sales and market share could decline.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively, which could cause our net sales and market share to decline.\nThe consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, and characterized by frequent introduction of new competitors, as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their product portfolio, aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins and rapid consolidation of the market resulting in larger competitors. We face competition from consumer electronics brands that have historically dominated the stereo headphone market, in addition to sport brand and lifestyle companies that also produce headphone products. These companies include, among others, Sony, Bose, LG, Turtle Beach and Apple (which includes Beats by Dr. Dre, which was purchased by Apple in 2014). These competitors may have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among certain groups of consumers, and greater economies of scale. In addition, these competitors have long-term relationships with many of our larger retailers that are potentially more important to those retailers. As a result, these competitors may be better equipped to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by:\n\u2022\nquickly adapting to changes in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nreadily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities;\n\u2022\ndiscounting excess inventory;\n\u2022\ndevoting greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement;\n\u2022\nadopting aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u2022\nengaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other legal disputes.\nAdditionally, the industry in which we compete generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have begun to introduce their own private label headphones, which could reduce the volume of product they buy from us, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to our products. If we are unable to protect our brand image and authenticity, while carefully balancing our growth, we may be unable to effectively\ncompete with these new market entrants or new products. The inability to compete effectively against new and existing competitors could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations, preventing us from achieving future growth.\nIf we are unable to obtain intellectual property rights and/or enforce those rights against third parties who are violating those rights, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade dress to protect our brand name, reputation, product appearance and technology. If we fail to obtain, maintain, or in some cases enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to copy our designs, or use our brand name, trademarks or technology. As a result, if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, or resolve any conflicts effectively, our results of operations may be harmed.\nWe are susceptible to counterfeiting of our products, which may harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and force us to incur expenses in enforcing our intellectual property rights. Such claims and lawsuits can be expensive to resolve, require substantial management time and resources, and may not provide a satisfactory or timely result, any of which would harm our results of operations. It can be particularly difficult and expensive to detect and stop counterfeiting, whether in the United States or abroad. Despite our efforts to enforce our intellectual property, counterfeiters may continue to violate our intellectual property rights by using our trademarks or imitating or copying our products, which could harm our brand, reputation and financial condition. Since our products are sold internationally, we are also dependent on the laws of a range of countries to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. These laws may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States.\nWe also face competition from competitors in the United States and abroad that are not \u201ccounterfeiters\u201d but that may be using our patented technology, using confusingly similar trademarks, or copying the \u201clook-and-feel\u201d of our products. We may have to engage in expensive and distracting litigation to enforce and defend our patents, trademarks, trade dress, or other intellectual property rights. Our enforcement of our intellectual property rights also places such assets at risk. For example, it is common for a competitor that is accused of infringing a patent, trademark, or other intellectual property right to challenge the validity of that intellectual property right. If that intellectual property right is invalidated, it is no longer available to assert against other competitors. Finally, competitors may also circumvent a patent by designing around the patent.\nFurther, we are a party to licenses that grant us rights to intellectual property, including trademarks that are necessary or useful to our business. For example, we license the right to market certain products with the trade names and imagery of brands such as Koston, the NBA, FC Barcelona, Microsoft and Real Tree. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies or products, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nIf the popularity or growth of the portable media device, smartphone and gaming console markets stagnates or our products are no longer compatible with these devices, our business and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nWe have experienced growth in the past due in part to the popularity of, and increase in demand for, portable media devices, smartphones and gaming consoles. We expect that sales of such products will continue to drive a substantial portion of our net sales in the future. However, the markets for portable media devices, smartphones and gaming consoles continue to evolve rapidly and are dominated by several large companies. Increased competition in the headphone market from established media device companies, including enhanced headphones bundled by the manufacturer, a decline in demand or popularity for such products due to technological changes or otherwise, legal restrictions or the inability to use our products with portable media devices, smartphones or gaming consoles, may negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our retailers and distributors. In addition, a portion of our net sales are generated by orders for immediate delivery, particularly during our historical peak season from August through December. If we fail to accurately forecast retailer and distributor demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our retailers or distributors. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include:\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer demand for our products;\n\u2022\nlack of consumer acceptance for our new products;\n\u2022\nproduct introductions and/or discounting by competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders;\n\u2022\nweakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items; and\n\u2022\nterrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials.\nInventory levels in excess of retailer and distributor demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on our gross margin. In addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce a sufficient number of products to meet such unanticipated demand, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and damage to our reputation and retailer or distributor relationships.\nWe must order components for our products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Because our markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk we will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nOur net sales and operating income fluctuate on a seasonal basis and decreases in sales or margins during our peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced greater net sales in the second half of a calendar year relative to those in the first half, due to a concentration of shopping around the fall and holiday seasons. As a result, our net sales and gross margins are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters and lower in the first and second quarters, as fixed operating costs are spread over the differing levels of sales volume. Given the strong seasonal nature of our sales, appropriate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue and any shortfall in expected third and fourth quarter net sales would cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly.\nOne of our retailers accounts for a significant amount of our net sales, and the loss of, or reduced purchases from, this or other retailers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOne of our retailers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2015 and 2014. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our retailers and all of our retailers generally purchase from us on a purchase order basis. As a result, this retailer generally may, with no notice or penalty, cease ordering and selling our products, or materially reduce their orders. If certain retailers, individually or in the aggregate, choose to no longer sell our products, to slow their rate of purchase of our products or to decrease the number of products they purchase, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial condition of our retailers and distributors.\nSome of our retailers and distributors have experienced financial difficulties in the past. A retailer or distributor experiencing such difficulties generally will not purchase and sell as many of our products as it would under normal circumstances and may cancel orders. In addition, a retailer or distributor experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. We extend credit to our retailers and distributors based on our assessment of their financial condition, generally without requiring collateral, and sometimes are not able to obtain information regarding their current financial status. Failure of these retailers or distributors to remain current on their obligations to us could result in losses that exceed the reserves we set aside in anticipation of this risk. Additionally, while we have credit insurance against some of our larger retailers, there is no assurance that such insurance will sufficiently cover any losses. We are also exposed to the risk of our customers declaring bankruptcy, exposing us to claims of preferential payment claims. Financial difficulties on the part of our retailers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the mix of retailers and distributors to whom we sell our products could impact our gross margin and brand image, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe sell our products through a mix of retailers, including specialty, consumer electronics, big-box, sporting goods and mobile phone retailers and to distributors. The retail landscape is changing with consumers shopping habits shifting away from the traditional brick and mortar stores to online sales. Any changes to our current mix of retailers and distributors could adversely affect our gross margin and could negatively affect both our brand image and our reputation. We generally realize lower gross margins when we sell through our distributors, and therefore our gross margins may be adversely impacted if we increase product sales made through distributors as opposed to direct to our retailers. In addition, we sell certain products at higher margins than others and any significant changes to our product mix made available to our retailers could adversely affect our gross margin. A negative change in our gross margin or our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, we must keep up with changes in technology and successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which we compete, we must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. In addition, our products must remain compatible with smartphones, tablets, computers and other similar consumer electronic devices that transmit audio. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including: remaining compatible with changes in technology; timely and successful product development; market acceptance; our ability to manage the risks associated with the new product production ramp-up issues, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, if technology changes and our products are no longer compatible or we cannot effectively introduce new products and manage transitions, our financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nWe face business, political, operational, financial and economic risks because a portion of our net sales are generated internationally and substantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the United States.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 international net sales were $75.4 million, or 28.3% of net sales. In addition, substantially all of our products are manufactured in China. In the past we have experienced increased lead-time from some of our manufacturers in China and we may encounter such increased lead-times in the future. Changing economic conditions in China may cause further issues with lead-time and impact the financial solvency of our third party manufacturers. Because we operate on a build-to-forecast model, extended lead-time can cause unexpected inventory shortages or excesses which may reduce our net sales.\nIn addition, we face business, political, operational, financial and economic risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties obtaining domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws, which could halt, interrupt or delay our operations if we cannot obtain such approvals, permits and licenses, and that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties encountered by our international distributors or us in staffing and managing foreign operations or international sales, including higher labor costs, which could increase our expenses and decrease our net sales and profitability;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels, which could halt, interrupt or delay our operations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles for, and greater difficulty collecting, accounts receivable, which could reduce our net sales and harm our financial results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial solvency of our third party manufacturers would impact our ability to receive inventory timely;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, higher tariffs, currency fluctuations or the imposition of additional regulations relating to import or export of our products, especially in China, where substantially all of our products are manufactured, which could force us to seek alternate manufacturing sources or increase our expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, strikes, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the global transportation network such as a port strike, and work stoppages or other labor unrest.\nAny of these factors could reduce our net sales, decrease our gross margins and increase our expenses. Should we establish our own operations in international territories where we currently utilize distributors, we will become subject to greater risks associated with operating outside of the United States.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase our costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect our activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection and compliance, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, mobile communications,\nintellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental, health, and safety.\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to consumer electronics in the many jurisdictions in which we operate are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of devices. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude us from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit its business practices. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nIf our relationship with our manufacturers terminates or is otherwise impaired, we would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of our products and a material loss of net sales.\nWe have no long-term contracts with our manufacturers and, as a result, our manufacturers could cease to provide products to us without notice. We have a limited number of manufactures we use and some of our products are produced by one manufacturer. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications and regulatory schemes covering our products in our key markets, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. In the event our manufacturers experience operational or financial difficulties, or terminate our relationship, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have created a manufacturer selection and qualification program and are actively looking for new manufacturing sources in other countries and other regions of China. Qualifying new manufacturing sources may result in increased costs, disruptions and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products while seeking alternative manufacturing sources, and a corresponding loss of net sales. In addition, any new manufacturer may not perform to our expectations or produce quality products in a timely, cost-efficient manner, either of which could make it difficult for us to meet our retailers\u2019 and distributors\u2019 orders on satisfactory commercial terms.\nThe failure of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages or delivery delays, either of which could harm our business.\nAny shortage of raw materials or components could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a cost-efficient manner or could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our retailers or distributors, which could harm our business.\nThe ability of our manufacturers to supply our products is dependent, in part, upon the availability of raw materials and certain components. Our manufacturers may experience shortages in the availability of raw materials or components, which could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us. For example, we are dependent on the supply of certain components for our production of iPhone compatible headphones. These components are in high demand and we have experienced supply shortages in the past. Any shortage of raw materials or components or inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase the costs for our products or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely cost-efficient manner. As a result, we could experience cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to our reputation.\nFrom time to time, our products may contain design and manufacturing defects. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware we sell. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to our reputation.\nOur business could suffer if any of our manufacturers fail to use acceptable labor practices.\nWe do not control our manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by a manufacturer utilized by us, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or legal in the United States, could damage our reputation or disrupt the shipment of finished products to us if such manufacturer is ordered to cease its manufacturing operations due to violations of laws or if such manufacturer\u2019s operations are adversely\naffected by such failure to use acceptable labor practices. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience problems with our distribution network for domestic and international retailers, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our distribution facilities operated by third party supply chain providers for the majority of our domestic and international product distribution. Our distribution facilities utilizes computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. We have experienced some of these problems in the past and we cannot assure you that we will not experience similar problems in the future. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of retailers or an erosion of our brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our warehouse facilities. If we encounter problems with the facilities, our ability to meet retailer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nOur current executive officers are critical to our success and the loss of any of these individuals, or other key personnel, could harm our business and brand image.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the contributions, talent and leadership of our current executive officers. The loss of executive officers or the inability to attract or retain qualified executive officers could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell our products and damage our brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in management may have a negative effect on our business and operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified design and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these individuals worldwide and we may not be able to attract or retain these employees.\nClaims that we violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights may give rise to burdensome litigation, result in potential liability for damages or impede our development efforts.\nWe cannot assure you that our products or activities do not violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease developing, manufacturing, or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nredesign or reengineer products;\n\u2022\nchange our business processes; and\n\u2022\npay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement or violation found to be willful.\nIn the event of an adverse determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or our failure to license essential technology, our sales could be harmed and/or our costs could increase, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe may be subject to product liability or warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers than expected, which could harm our net sales.\nWe generally provide a limited lifetime warranty on all of our products. In addition, if a consumer breaks his or her headphones, we generally offer such consumer the option to buy another pair of headphones at a 50% discount to the retail price. The occurrence of any quality problems due to defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. In addition to the risk of direct costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems, any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could also affect our brand image, decrease retailer and distributor demand and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into contracts with various customers and distributors granting a right of return allowance with respect to defective products. We have also executed an open return program with a major retailer allowing for an unlimited amount of returns. Estimates for these items are based on actual experience and are recorded at the time net sales are recognized. If we experience a greater number of returns than expected, our net sales could be harmed.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nOur stock has experienced substantial price volatility. Additionally, Skullcandy, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. Factors such as the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perceptions of us and our business, actions by institutional shareholders, strategic actions by us, litigation, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations and principles, additions or departures of key personal and our results of operations, financial performance and future prospects may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from realizing the liquidity of their shares.\nOur credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility.\nOur credit facility contains certain financial covenants and other restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nundergo a merger or consolidation;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nguarantee certain obligations of third parties;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmaterially change our line of business;\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or make certain distributions;\n\u2022\nmake advances, loans or extensions of credit; and\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness.\nIn addition, we have granted the lenders a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets. Failure to comply with the operating restrictions or financial covenants in the credit facility could result in a default which could cause the lender to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise its lien on substantially all of our assets. This could cause us to cease operations and result in a complete loss of your investment in our common stock.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may disrupt our business and make our products less competitive, having a material adverse impact on our business\nWith approximately 28.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 arising from foreign net sales, a growing percentage of our net revenues are derived from markets outside the U.S. Our international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Products sold by our international businesses and the cost of these products may be affected by relative changes in the value of the local currencies of our subsidiaries and our manufacturers. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our net revenues, margins and operating results. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of the contract manufacturers from which we source our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. As a result, currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. While our hedging program is focused on currency risk exposures on some of our operations, we cannot provide assurance that our hedging program will be successful in minimizing exposures to foreign currency fluctuations. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations.\nAdditionally, concerns regarding the short- and long-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the Eurozone could lead individual countries to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, potentially dislocating the euro. If this were to occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency could be significantly devalued, the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially\nincrease, and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies, we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security could adversely affect us\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. We rely on accounting, financial and operational management information systems to conduct our operations. Any disruption in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store common confidential information about customers, employees, vendors, and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. Any failure to maintain the security of the data, including the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 12922, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "SKUL"}
