Many of these risks are beyond our control although efforts are made to manage those risks while simultaneously optimizing operational and financial results. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d beginning on page 2 of this Annual Report.\nCOVID-19 RISK\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse impact, possibly materially, on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions in the economy, changed customer behaviors, disrupted supply chains, created volatility in equity markets, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. While the development and distribution of vaccines are occurring at a rapid pace, it is not yet known whether the vaccines will be widely adopted or known effective against the various strains of the virus. The pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing requirements in many of the communities we serve. As a result, the demand for our products and services has been significantly impacted, which could adversely affect our revenue. The pandemic continues to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses remain\nclosed, unemployment levels rise or regional economic conditions worsen. In response to the pandemic, we have initiated relief programs designed to support our customers and communities including payment deferral programs, deferral-related and other fee waivers, and other expanded assistance for customers.\nOur business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. The increase in the number of employees working remotely throughout the economy also subjects us, our customers, and our vendors to additional cybersecurity risk as cybercriminals attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, compromise business emails, and generate phishing attacks during this time.\nIn response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes declined to historic lows. Various bond buying programs have also been implemented in order to stabilize the financial system and reduce volatility in key debt markets. The effectiveness of these efforts is uncertain, and we cannot predict future developments, including how long the outbreak and related restrictions will last, which geographical regions may be particularly affected, or what other government responses may occur.\nFuture governmental actions may require additional types of customer-related responses that could negatively impact our financial results. We could be required to take capital actions in response to the pandemic, including reducing dividends and eliminating stock repurchases. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic; efficacy of vaccines; actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic; the effect on our customers, counterparties, employees and third party service providers; and the effect on economies and markets. To the extent that the pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe majority of our assets are loans, which if not repaid would result in losses to the Bank.\nMaking any loan involves various risks, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. Our credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may fail to identify or reduce these credit risks, and they cannot completely eliminate all credit risks related to our loan portfolio. If the overall economic climate, including employment rates, real estate markets, interest rates and general economic growth, in the United States, generally, or Tennessee (particularly the Nashville MSA), specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the levels of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require additional provisions for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. In addition, we record a reserve for unfunded commitments, considering the same items included in the allowance for credit losses with the addition of expected funding. Management\u2019s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance and reserve for unfunded commitments is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or the reserve for unfunded commitments. The model is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecasts and incorporates management judgement. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in our acquisitions (and any future acquisitions) also will affect our allowance for credit losses. We are required to determine whether purchased loans held for investment have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Loans that have experienced this level of deterioration in credit quality are subject to special accounting at initial recognition. We initially measure the amortized cost of a purchase credit deteriorated loan by adding the acquisition date estimate of expected credit losses to the loan's purchase price (i.e. the \"gross up\" approach). If we have underestimated credit losses at recognition, we will incur additional expense in our provision for credit losses to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses on those loans.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for credit losses. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 77.9% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. This includes collateral consisting of income producing and residential construction properties, which properties tend to be more sensitive to general economic conditions and downturns in real estate markets. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio and could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality and our financial condition or results of operations. These adverse changes could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral to secure the loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for credit losses. Thus, declines in the value of real estate collateral could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our loan portfolio: commercial real estate (both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied) - 36%; commercial and industrial - 19%; and construction - 17%. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate. Additionally, these types of loans also often involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. These higher credit risks are further heightened when the loans are concentrated in a small number of larger borrowers leading to relationship exposure.\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, and therefore have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner. In addition, banking regulators have been giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nCommercial and industrial loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the assets securing the loans depreciate over time, are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction or development equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction or development (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder\u2019s ability to sell the property. During the construction or development phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by foreclosure on collateral.\nCommercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle due to the vulnerability of these sectors during a downturn. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans. We also make both secured and unsecured loans to our commercial customers. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Because of this lack of collateral, we are limited in our ability to collect on defaulted unsecured loans. Further, the collateral that secures our secured commercial and industrial loans typically includes inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, which usually have a value that is insufficient to satisfy the loan without a loss if the business does not succeed. Our loan\nconcentration in these sectors and their higher credit risk could lead to increased losses on these loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMARKET AND INTEREST RATE RISK\nDifficult or volatile market conditions in the national financial markets, the U.S. economy generally, or the state of Tennessee in particular may adversely affect our lending activity or other businesses, as well as our financial condition.\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to weak economic conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the state of Tennessee, the principal market in which we conduct business. A deterioration in economic conditions in our primary market areas could result in increased loan delinquencies, foreclosures, and write-downs of asset values, lower demand for our products and services, reduced low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits, and intangible asset impairment. Additionally, difficult market conditions may lead to a deterioration in the value of the collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, which could reduce our customers' ability to repay outstanding loans and reduce the value of assets associated with our existing loans. Additional issues surrounding weakening economic conditions and volatile markets that could adversely impact us include increased industry regulation and downward pressures on our stock price.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Tennessee. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 76% of our loans and approximately 81% of our deposits were made to borrowers or received from depositors who live and/or primarily conduct business in Tennessee. Therefore, our success will depend in large part upon the general economic conditions in this area. This geographic concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification, as adverse economic developments in Tennessee (including the Nashville MSA, our largest market), among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans, reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio, reduce the value of the collateral securing our loans and reduce the amount of our deposits.\nAny regional or local economic downturn that affects Tennessee or existing or prospective borrowers, depositors or property values in this area may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference, or spread, between interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities may fluctuate. This may cause decreases in our spread and may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including, without limitation: the rate of inflation; economic conditions; federal monetary policies; and stability of domestic and foreign markets.\nAlthough we have implemented procedures we believe will reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, these procedures may not always be successful. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income and our net interest margin, asset quality, loan and lease origination volume, liquidity or overall profitability. Additionally, changes in interest rates can adversely impact the origination of mortgage loans held for sale and resulting mortgage banking revenues.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nIn November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the London Interbank Offered Rate administrator, announced its intention to continue LIBOR until June 30, 2023. The Financial Conduct Authority announced support for this development, signaling an extension from its prior communication that it would no longer require panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee was convened in the U.S. to explore alternative reference rates and supporting processes. The ARRC is made up of financial and capital market institutions, is convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and includes participation by various regulators. The ARRC identified a potential successor rate to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and crafted the Paced Transition Plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. We have not yet determined the optimal replacement reference rate(s) that will\nultimately replace LIBOR in current contracts maturing after LIBOR cessation. We have introduced SOFR as an option for use in our variable or adjustable rate credit products going forward. We have organized an internal transition program to identify system, operational, and contractual impacts, assess our risks, manage the transition, facilitate communication with our customers, and monitor the program progress.\nThe retirement of LIBOR is a significant shift in the industry. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of our investment securities portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and market conditions, including credit deterioration of the issuers of individual securities.\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect both the returns on and fair value of our investment securities. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or increase unrealized losses in our portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political issues, and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, actual investment income and cash flows from investment securities that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed securities and callable securities, may materially differ from those anticipated at the time of investment or subsequently as a result of changes in interest rates and market conditions. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income or our results of operations.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by, or questions or concerns about the creditworthiness of, a counterparty or client, or concerns about the financial services industry generally. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. In addition to our traditional funding sources, we also may borrow funds from third-party lenders or issue equity or debt securities to investors. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMORTGAGE BANKING RISK\nOur mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market.\nWe may not be able to grow our mortgage business at the same rate of growth achieved in recent years or even grow our mortgage business at all. The success of our mortgage segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors, in each case at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Mortgage production, especially refinancing activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. Our mortgage origination volume could be materially and adversely affected by rising interest rates. Moreover, when interest rates increase, there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current levels. Further, over half of our mortgage volume is through our consumer direct internet delivery channel, which targets national customers. As a result, loan originations through this channel are particularly susceptible to the interest rate environment and the national housing market.\nBecause we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. In fact, when rates rise, we expect increasing industry-wide competitive pressures related to changing market conditions to reduce pricing margins and mortgage revenues generally. If our level of mortgage production declines, our continued profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations. If we are unable to do so, our continued profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn 2020, we sold nearly all of the $6.65 billion of mortgage loans held for sale that we closed. When mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. We may be required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach certain representations or warranties in connection with the sale of such loans. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase, such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights asset is subjective by nature and may be vulnerable to inaccuracies or other events outside our control.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights asset can fluctuate. Particularly, the asset could decrease in value if prepay speeds, delinquency rates, or the cost to service increases or overall values decrease causing a lack of liquidity of MSRs in the market. Similarly, the value may decrease if interest rates decrease or change in a non-parallel manner or are otherwise volatile. All of which are mostly out of FirstBank\u2019s control. We must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when valuing this asset. An inaccurate valuation, or changes to the valuation due to factors outside of our control, could negatively impact our ability to realize the full value of this asset. As a result, our balance sheet may not precisely represent the fair market value of this and other financial assets.\nWe are dependent on U.S. government-sponsored entities and government agencies, and any changes in these entities, their current roles or the leadership at such entities or their regulators could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales depends on programs administered by GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government agencies, including Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d), in the secondary market. Presently, almost all of the newly originated loans that we originate directly with borrowers qualify under existing standards for inclusion in MBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. A number of legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that would wind down or phase out the GSEs. It is not possible to predict the scope and nature of the actions that the U.S. government, will ultimately take with respect to the GSEs. Any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their regulators or the U.S. federal government, and any changes in leadership at these entities, could adversely affect our business and prospects. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or any significant adverse change in their capital structure, financial condition, activity levels in the primary or secondary mortgage markets or in underwriting criteria could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nElimination of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or any changes to the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the fees, terms and guidelines that govern our selling and servicing relationships with them, could also materially and adversely affect our ability to sell and securitize loans through our loan production segment, and the performance, liquidity and market value of our investments. Moreover, any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guarantee obligations could redefine what constitutes an Agency MBS and could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur mortgage operation originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates, housing prices, applicable government regulations and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans, the revenues received from servicing such loans for others and, ultimately, reduce our net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we utilize to sell mortgage loans may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business. Our revenue from the mortgage banking\nbusiness was $255.3 million in 2020. This revenue could significantly decline in future periods if interest rates were to rise and the other risks highlighted in this paragraph were realized, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our mortgage loan servicing obligations.\nWe act as servicer for approximately $9.79 billion of mortgage loans owned by third parties as of December 31, 2020. As a servicer for those loans, we have certain contractual obligations to third parties. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income. For certain investors and/or transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for origination errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or if we have increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within our mortgage banking noninterest income. In addition, we may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our residential lending or servicing business and, as a result, our profitability.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISK\nWe are subject to significant government regulation and supervision.\nFB Financial Corporation and FirstBank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision by the FDIC, Tennessee Department of Financial Institution, the Federal Reserve Board, CFPB, among others, the primary focus of which is to protect customers, depositors, the deposit insurance fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. The quantity and scope of applicable federal and state regulations may place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as financial technology companies, finance companies, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. These laws and regulations apply to almost every aspect of our business, and affect our lending practices and procedures, capital structure, investment activities, deposit gathering activities, our services and products, risk management practices, dividend policy and growth, including through acquisitions.\nLegislation and regulation with respect to our industry has increased in recent years, and we expect that supervision and regulation will continue to expand in scope and complexity. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could subject us to additional costs, restrict our growth, limit the services and products we may offer or limit the pricing of banking services and products. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with laws and regulation increases our costs and could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nIf we receive less than satisfactory results on regulatory examinations, we could be subject to damage to our reputation, significant fines and penalties, requirements to increase compliance and risk management activities and related costs and restriction on acquisitions, new locations, new lines of business, or continued growth. Future changes in federal and state banking could adversely affect our operating results and ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations subject us to additional restrictions, oversight and reporting obligations, which have significantly increased costs. And over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on enhanced risk management practices, mortgage law and regulation, compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws, data integrity and security, use of service providers, and fair lending and other consumer protection issues, which has increased our need to build additional processes and infrastructure. Government agencies charged with adopting and interpreting laws, rules and regulations, may do so in an unforeseen manner, including in ways that potentially expand the reach of the laws, rules or regulations more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict both the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. These federal and state laws, regulations and policies are described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness: Supervision and regulation: Bank regulation: Bank dividends\u201d and \u201cBusiness: Supervision and regulation: Holding company regulation: Restriction on bank holding company dividends,\u201d and generally consider previous results and net income, capital needs, asset quality, existence of enforcement or remediation proceedings, and overall financial\ncondition in determining whether a dividend payment is appropriate. For the foreseeable future, the majority, if not all, of our revenue will be from any dividends paid to us by the Bank. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends also depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. Further, the present and future dividend policy of the Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors. We cannot guarantee that we or the Bank will be permitted by financial condition or applicable regulatory restrictions to pay dividends, that the board of directors of the Bank will elect to pay dividends to us, or the timing or amount of any dividend actually paid. See \u201cDividend policy.\u201d If we do not pay dividends, market perceptions of our common stock may be adversely affected, which could in turn create downward pressure on our stock price.\nAs the parent company of FirstBank, the Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires us to act as a source of strength to the Bank and to commit capital and financial resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. In addition, if we commit to a federal bank regulator that we will maintain the capital of the Bank, whether in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by a bankruptcy trustee and, as a result, the Bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of our other creditors. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by us in order to support the Bank may adversely impact our cash flow, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOur financial condition may be affected negatively by the costs of litigation.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. From time to time, and particularly during periods of economic stress, customers may make claims or otherwise take legal action pertaining to performance of our responsibilities. These claims are often referred to as \u201clender liability\u201d claims. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of our responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a favorable manner, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect our market perception, products and services, as well as potentially affecting customer demand for those products and services. In many cases, we may seek reimbursement from our insurance carriers to cover such costs and expenses. These claims, as well as supervisory and enforcement actions by our regulators could involve large monetary claims, capital directives, regulatory agreements and directives and significant defense costs. The outcome of any such cases or actions is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe rely on third party vendors to provide services that are integral to the operation of our business.\nWe depend on many third-party service providers that are integral to the operation of our business. These vendors service our mortgage loan business, provide critical core systems processing services, essential web hosting and other internet systems, and deposit processing services. If any of these service providers fail to perform servicing duties or perform those duties inadequately, we could experience a temporary interruption in our business, sustain credit losses on our loans or incur additional costs to obtain a replacement servicer. There can be no assurance that a replacement servicer could be retained in a timely manner or at a similar cost.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain these relationships on favorable terms. In addition, some of our data processing services are provided by companies associated with our competitors. The loss of these vendor relationships could disrupt the services we provide to our customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we experienced issues with our mortgage servicing provider, our servicing rights could be terminated or we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of such failures of our third-party service providers, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, we utilize many vendors that provide services to support our operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data. A cyber security breach of a vendor's system may result in theft and/or unavailability of our data or disruption of business processes. In most cases, we will remain primarily liable to our\ncustomers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor's data security system. We rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls. We have procedures in place to assess a vendor's cyber security controls prior to establishing a contractual relationship and to periodically review assessments of those control systems. However, these procedures are not infallible, and a vendor's system can be breached despite the procedures we employ.\nIf these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance risks. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including as a result of cyber-attacks or data security breaches, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we, and our vendors, use may be vulnerable to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, ransomware, and other disruptive problems caused by cyber criminals. Any damage or failure that causes breakdowns or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nComputer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, nation state supported organizations, terrorists, and other external parties. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, vendors, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, unavailability, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe are under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks, especially as we continue to expand client capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in significant potential liabilities to customers and other third parties, reputational damage, the disruption of our operations and regulatory concerns, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not have the resources to implement new technology to stay current with these changes.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments as we continue to grow and expand our market area. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest, and have invested significantly more than us, in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers, which could impair our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, client or employee fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against these operational risks. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended.\nCatastrophic events and disasters could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations or result in other consequences which could have an adverse impact on our financial results or condition.\nA significant portion of our business is located in the Southeast and includes areas which are susceptible to weather-related events such as tornadoes, floods, droughts, and fires. Such events can disrupt our operations, cause damage to our properties, and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. The severity and impact of future natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, and other weather-related events are difficult to predict. While we maintain insurance covering many of these weather-related events, there is no insurance against the disruption that such a catastrophic event could cause in the markets that we serve, the resulting adverse impact on our borrowers\u2019 ability to timely repay their loans, and/or the value of any collateral held by us.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international trade disputes, political unrest, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, and slow growth in the global economy, as well as acts of terrorism, war, and other violence could result in disruptions in the financial markets or the markets that we serve. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and may affect our ability to access capital.\nSTRATEGIC AND OTHER BUSINESS RISKS\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to risk.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions, which involves significant operational, strategic, and regulatory risks. Acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value, and integrating acquired companies may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than we expect.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers, and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire or to realize our attempts to eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations in a timely manner may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we currently maintain or may acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nIf we continue to grow, we will face risks arising from our increased size. If we do not manage such growth effectively, we may be unable to realize the benefit from the investments in technology, infrastructure and personnel that we have made to support our expansion. In addition, we may incur higher costs and realize less revenue growth than we expect, which would reduce our earnings and diminish our future prospects, and we may not be able to continue to implement our business strategy and successfully conduct our operations. Risks associated with failing to maintain effective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as maintaining appropriate loan underwriting procedures, information technology systems, determining adequate allowances for loan losses and complying with regulatory accounting requirements, including increased loan losses, reduced earnings and potential regulatory penalties and restrictions on growth, all could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur pursuit of acquisitions may disrupt our business, and any equity that we issue as merger consideration may have the effect of diluting the value of your investment. In addition, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions. We anticipate that the integration of businesses that we may acquire in the future will be a time-consuming and expensive process, even if the integration process is effectively planned and implemented. If difficulties arise with respect to the integration process, the economic benefits expected to result from acquisitions might not occur. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to other financial institutions. Failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, or our ability to implement our strategy, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to complete future financial institution acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate and engage in the acquisition of other banking organizations. We must satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before we can complete an acquisition of another bank or bank holding company, including federal and state bank regulatory approvals. The process for obtaining required regulatory approvals can be time-consuming and unpredictable and is subject to numerous regulatory and policy factors, a number of which are beyond our control. We may fail to pursue or to complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of the perceived difficulty or impossibility of obtaining required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.\nWe have a shareholder who owns a significant portion of our stock and that shareholders' interests in our business may be different than our other shareholders.\nMr. Ayers, our Vice Chairman and Founder, currently owns approximately 29% of our common stock. Further, Mr. Ayers has the right under the shareholder's agreement, by and between the Company and Mr. Ayers and entered into in connection with the Company's initial public offering, to designate up to 20% of our directors and at least one member of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees of our board of directors for so long as permitted under applicable law. So long as Mr. Ayers continues to own a significant portion of our common stock, he will have the ability to influence the vote in any election of directors and will have the ability to significantly influence a vote regarding a transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others believe the transaction is in our best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of Mr. Ayers may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock of a company with a significant shareholder.\nWe could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAt December 31, 2020, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $265.0 million. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired because, for example, the acquired business does not meet projected revenue targets or certain key employees leave, we are required to write down the carrying value of these assets. We conduct a review at least annually to determine whether goodwill is impaired. Our goodwill impairment evaluation indicated no impairment of goodwill for our reporting segments. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our shareholders' equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Tennessee, with our largest market being the Nashville MSA, which is a highly competitive banking market. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas, and we compete with them for the same customers. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and community banks. In many instances these national and regional banks have greater resources than we do, and the smaller community banks may have stronger ties in local markets than we do, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including thrift institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other internet-based companies offering financial services which enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower\ncost structures. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial institutions have opened offices and solicit deposits in our market areas. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFurther, a number of larger banks have recently entered the Nashville MSA, and we believe this trend will continue as banks look to gain a foothold in this growing market. This trend will likely result in greater competition in, and may impair our ability to grow our share of our largest market.", "PERMNO": 16319, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBK"}
