In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nyou should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. If any of the events described in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operation and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. Therefore, we urge you to carefully review this entire report and consider the risk factors discussed below. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business, operations and clinical development plans and timelines could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic,\non the manufacturing, clinical trial and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, including our contract manufacturers, clinical research organizations, or CROs, shippers and others.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics wherever we have clinical trial sites or other business operations. In addition, health epidemics could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs and other third parties upon whom we rely.\nWe have implemented work-from-home policies for many of our employees. The effects of our work-from-home policies and travel restrictions may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on a worldwide supply chain to manufacture products used in our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Quarantines, shelter-in-place and\nsimilar government orders, or the expectation that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions could occur, whether related to COVID-19 or\nother infectious diseases, could impact personnel at our own manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our supply chain.\nIf our relationships with our suppliers or other vendors are terminated or scaled back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nor other health epidemics, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Switching or adding additional suppliers or vendors involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new supplier or vendor commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any future commercialization timelines. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not harm our business.\nIn addition, our preclinical studies and clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClinical site initiation, patient enrollment and activities that require visits to clinical sites, including data monitoring, have been and may continue to be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic\nor concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a pandemic. Some patients may have difficulty following certain aspects of clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened\nexposure to COVID-19 or\nexperience additional restrictions by their institutions, city, or state our clinical trial operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which\nhas caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may\nbe difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could\nmaterially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global COVID-19\npandemic continues to evolve rapidly. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nor a similar epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We may experience a material impact on our operations, and we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation\nclosely.\nWe will require substantial additional financial resources to continue ongoing development of our product candidates and pursue our business objectives; if we are unable to obtain these additional resources when needed, we may be forced to delay or discontinue our planned operations, including clinical testing of our product candidates.\nWe have not generated significant revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $80.0 million, and, as of December 31, 2020, we have incurred approximately $764.1 million of accumulated deficit since our inception in 2003. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenditures and net losses. Further development of our product candidates will require substantial increases in our expenses as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to undertake clinical trials for product candidates;\n\u2022\nscale-up\nthe formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for product candidates;\n\u2022\nwork with regulatory authorities to identify and address program-related inquiries;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $115.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Given our current development plans, we anticipate our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2022 and we have no committed sources of additional capital at this time. The forecast of cash resources is forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, and the actual amount of our expenses could vary materially and adversely as a result of a number of factors. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our expenses could prove to be significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Management does not know whether additional financing will be on terms favorable or acceptable to us when needed, if at all.\nOur actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, changes in the focus and direction of our development programs, slower than expected progress of our research and development efforts, changes in governmental regulation, competitive and technical advances, costs associated with the development of our product candidates, our ability to secure partnering arrangements, and costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. The COVID-19\npandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated, regardless of the reason, and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them.\nFurther, we may elect to prioritize one or more of our programs and reduce or eliminate our activities on our other programs to preserve our capital resources. Any decision to reduce or eliminate activities for a program may negatively impact the potential for the program, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For instance, we expect to reduce the amount of resources and capital allocated to our Controlled IL-12\nprogram in 2021 and to actively explore partnership opportunities for the Controlled IL-12 program to support its continued development. In connection with this reduction in spend, we are evaluating potential changes to data collection of long term follow up and reducing other activities. Some of these changes to our planned Controlled IL-12\nprogram may impact the prospects and future development of this program, including our ability to pursue later stage development.\nWe need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. The manner in which we raise any additional funds may affect the value of your investment in our common stock.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and collaboration agreements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. The unpredictability of the capital markets may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic continues to disrupt the global financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding in the future. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Moreover, if we fail to advance one or more of our current product candidates into early or later-stage clinical trials, successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates, or acquire new product candidates for development, we may have difficulty attracting investors that might otherwise be a source of additional financing.\nIn June 2019, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, as agent, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Jefferies, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. Shares will be sold pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-232283), as previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,814,673 shares of our common stock under the sales agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $13.0 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses of $0.4 million and may sell and issue approximately $80.9 million in additional shares under the sales agreement.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities such as under our at-the-market program, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing that we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. Furthermore, the ongoing impact of COVID-19\non global financial markets could make the terms of any available financing less attractive to use and more dilutive to our existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe have issued or reserved for future issuance shares nearing the maximum number of shares of common stock authorized by our certificate of incorporation. If we are unable to increase the total number of authorized shares, we may be unable to effectively utilize our common stock to establish strategic relationships with other companies, expand our business through acquisitions, raise capital, or offer equity incentives to employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 24, 2020, there were 214,667,023 shares of common stock outstanding and an additional 31,115,329 shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options and warrants. Though we have no immediate plans to issue additional shares of common stock, other than in connection with our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, we may need additional shares for business and financial purposes in the future. For example, we will need additional shares of authorized common stock to raise capital to, among other things, fund our operations, conduct and/or complete clinical trials, continue our research and development activities, seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we may wish to issue additional shares in connection with entering into future strategic relationships, or acquiring other businesses, therapeutics or product candidates. Furthermore, our success depends, in part, on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and clinical and scientific personnel, and the lack of available unissued shares may also have an adverse impact on our to provide appropriate equity incentives to employees, officers, directors, consultants and/or advisors. If we are unable to increase the total number of authorized shares available to us, our business development and financing opportunities may be limited, and stockholder value may be harmed.\nOur plans to develop and commercialize non-viral\nand viral adoptive cellular therapies based on engineered cytokines and CAR T-cell\nas well as TCR therapies can be considered as new approaches to cancer treatment, the successful development of which is subject to significant challenges.\nWe intend to employ technologies such as the technology licensed from MD Anderson pursuant to the MD Anderson License described above, and from PGEN, pursuant to the License Agreement, to pursue the development and commercialization of non-viral\nand viral adoptive cellular therapies based on cytokines, T-cells,\nCARs and TCRs, possibly under control of the RTS\u00ae\nand other switch technologies targeting both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Because this is a new approach to cancer immunotherapy and cancer treatment generally, developing and commercializing product candidates subjects us to a number of challenges, including:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that have very limited experience with the commercial development of genetically modified and/or unmodified T-cell\ntherapies for cancer;\n\u2022\nidentifying and manufacturing appropriate TCRs from patient and from third parties that can be administered to a patient;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient\u2019s and/or donor\u2019s T-cells\nex vivo\nand infusing the T-cells\nback into the patient;\n\u2022\npossibly conditioning patients with chemotherapy in conjunction with delivering each of the potential products, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects of the potential products;\n\u2022\neducating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of each of the potential products, such as the potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ndeveloping processes for the safe administration of these potential products, including long-term follow-up\nfor all patients who receive the potential products;\n\u2022\nsourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process the potential products;\n\u2022\ndeveloping a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;\n\u2022\nestablishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndeveloping therapies for types of cancers beyond those addressed by the current potential products;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and defending the intellectual property rights relating to any products we develop;\n\u2022\nand not infringing the intellectual property rights, in particular, the patent rights, of third parties, including competitors, such as those developing T-cell\ntherapies.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these challenges, which could prevent us from achieving our research, development and commercialization goals.\nOur current product candidates are based on novel technologies and are supported by limited clinical data and we cannot assure you that our current and planned clinical trials will produce data that supports regulatory approval of one or more of these product candidates.\nThe immuno-oncology effector platform in which we have acquired rights pursuant to our License Agreement with PGEN represents early-stage technology in the field of human oncology biotherapeutics, with Ad-RTS-IL-12\nplus veledimex having completed trials, in melanoma, breast cancer and rGBM. Similarly, our genetically modified and/ or non-modified\nT-cell\ncandidates are supported by limited clinical data, all of which has been generated through trials conducted by MD Anderson, the NCI, and Eden BioCell, not by us. We plan to assume control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of our T-cell\nproduct candidates, and any failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, sponsorship of new INDs, or in filing INDs sponsored by us for these or any other product candidates we determine to advance could negatively affect the timing of our potential future clinical trials. Such an impact on timing could increase research and development costs and could delay or prevent obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, we did not control the design or conduct of the previous trials. It is possible that the FDA will not accept these previous trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any of one or more reasons, including the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate, the degree of product characterization, elements of the design or execution of the previous trials or safety concerns, or other trial results. We may also be subject to liabilities arising from any treatment-related injuries or adverse effects in patients enrolled in these previous trials. As a result, we may be subject to unforeseen third-party claims and delays in our potential future clinical trials. We may also be required to repeat in whole or in part clinical trials previously conducted by MD Anderson or other entities, which will be expensive and delay the submission and licensure or other regulatory approvals with respect to any of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the results of the limited clinical trials conducted to date may not be replicated in future clinical trials. Our Ad-RTS-IL-12\nplus veledimex and genetically modified and non-modified\nT-cell\nproduct candidates, as well as other product candidates, may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development, and we cannot assure you that the results of any future trials will demonstrate the value and efficacy of our product candidates. Moreover, there are a number of regulatory requirements that we must satisfy before we can continue clinical trials of CAR+ T, TCRs or other cellular therapy product candidates in the United States. Satisfaction of these requirements will entail substantial time, effort and financial resources. Any time, effort and financial resources we expend on our Ad-RTS-IL-12\nplus veledimex and genetically modified and non-modified\nT-cell\nproduct candidates and other early-stage product candidate development programs may adversely affect our ability to continue development and commercialization of our immuno-oncology product candidates.\nWe report interim data on certain of our clinical trials and we cannot assure you that interim data will be predictive of either future interim results or final study results.\nAs part of our business, we provide updates related to the development of our product candidates, which may include updates related to interim clinical trial data. To date, our clinical trials have involved small patient populations and because of the small sample size, the interim results of these clinical trials may be subject to substantial variability and may not be indicative of either future interim results or final results.\nWe face substantial competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully than, we do.\nThe development and commercialization for new products to treat cancer, including the indications we are pursuing, is highly competitive and considerable competition exists from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. Many of these companies have more experience in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory, and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer.\nOur genetically engineering T-cell\nprograms face significant competition in the CAR and TCR technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators. Three such companies, Novartis International AG (Kymriah\u00ae\n), Kite Pharma Inc./Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Yescarta\u00ae\n) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Breyanzi\u00ae), have now commercialized autologous CAR+ T cells against CD19. Additional companies developing autologous CAR+ T targets include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Precigen, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., in collaboration with Celgene Corporation, Nanjing Legend Biotech and Janssen Biotech, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, Gracell Biotechnologies Inc., CARsgen Therapeutics Co. Ltd., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Autolus Therapeutics plc, Exuma Biotech Corp., Mustang Bio, Inc., Crispr Therapeutics AG, Precision Biosciences Inc., Protheragen Inc. and Marker Therapeutics, Inc. Several companies are pursuing the development of allogeneic CAR+ T therapies, including Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.), Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Cellectis SA (in collaboration with Servier) which may compete with our product candidates.\nOur TCR program faces competition from several companies, including from Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc, ArsenalBio, Lyell, bluebird bio, Kite Pharma Inc./Gilead Sciences, Inc., Achilles Therapeutics Limited, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, Tmunity Therapeutics Inc, Medigene AG, Tactiva Therapeutics, LLC, Takara Bio, Inc., TCR2 Therapeutics Inc., Zelluna Immunotherapy AS, PACT Pharma, Inc. and others. Several companies, including Advaxis Inc./Amgen Inc., BioNTech AG and Gritstone Oncology, Inc., are pursuing vaccine platforms to target neoantigens for solid tumors. Other companies are developing non-viral\ngene therapies, including Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. and several companies developing CRISPR technology. We also face competition from companies developing therapies using cells other than T cells such as Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, NantKwest Inc., IN8bio, Inc., Fate Therapeutics Inc., and TC BioPharm Limited. We also face competition from companies developing T cells with cytokines such as Repertoire Immune Medicines and Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc. We also face competition from non-cell-\nbased treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., and Roche Holding AG.\nWe are initially developing our Controlled IL-12\nplatform for the treatment of rGBM. Companies that sell marketed drugs for rGBM are Genentech Inc. and Roche Holding AG with Avastin (bevacizumab), a vascular endothelial growth factor directed antibody indicated for the treatment of adults with rGBM. Arbor Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets GLIADEL Wafer, which is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation and is also indicated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme as an adjunct to surgery. Additionally, Novocure has developed Optune (tumor treating fields) for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Several companies have product candidates in Phase 3 development for the treatment of glioblastoma, including, but not limited to, Cordgenics, LLC, Bayer AG, Kazia Therapeutics Limited, and Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. Several companies and institutions have product candidates currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, including, but not limited to, Abbvie Inc., DNAtrix Therapeutics, Istari\nOncology, Karyopharm and MedImmune LLC/AstraZeneca plc, and other companies are actively developing additional products to treat brain cancer including Mustang Bio Inc. and Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. Other competitors with product candidates currently in Phase 2 clinical trials include AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Depatus-M\n(ABT-414)\nand DNA-2401,\na conditionally replicative adenovirus being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone or in combination with lomustine in recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients. Also, MedImmune, LLC/AstraZeneca plc\u2019s durvalumab was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with rGBM.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval of potential products, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our potential products. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our potential products. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our potential products is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our potential products, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our potential products. Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor\u2019s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as one of our potential products, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such potential products for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have products already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022\ndeveloping drugs and biopharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nundertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs and biopharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing drugs and biopharmaceuticals; and\n\u2022\nlaunching, marketing, and selling drugs and biopharmaceuticals.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.\nAny termination of our licenses with PGEN, MD Anderson or the National Cancer Institute or our research and development agreements with MD Anderson could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on patents, know-how,\nand proprietary technology that are licensed from others, particularly MD Anderson, Precigen and the National Cancer Institute, or the NCI, as well as the contributions by MD Anderson under our research and development agreements. Any termination of these licenses or research and development agreements could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product\ncandidates. Disputes may also arise between us and these licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the applicable license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes, and the technology and processes of PGEN, MD Anderson, the NCI and our other licensors, infringe intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the applicable license agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties pursuant to our relationships with our licensors and partners;\n\u2022\nwhether we are complying with our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our potential products under the MD Anderson License, the License Agreement with PGEN and our patent license agreement with the NCI;\n\u2022\nwhether or not our partners are complying with all of their obligations to support our programs under licenses and research and development agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe allocation of ownership of inventions and know-how\nresulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and by us.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements, particularly with MD Anderson, PGEN and the NCI, on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected potential products. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize potential products under our applicable licenses could suffer. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, and reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Recently, due to changes in U.S. law referred to as patent reform, new procedures including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented, which adds uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to our or our licensors\u2019 patents in the future.\nWe may not be able to retain the rights licensed to us and PGEN by MD Anderson to technologies relating to CAR, T-cell\ntherapies and other related technologies.\nUnder the MD Anderson License, we, together with PGEN, received an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel CAR+ T cell and\nTCR cell therapies arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who was then at MD Anderson, as well as either co-exclusive\nor non-exclusive\nlicenses under certain related technologies. When combined with PGEN\u2019s technology suite and Ziopharm\u2019s clinically tested RTS\u00ae\ninterleukin 12 modules, the resulting proprietary methods and technologies may help realize the promise of genetically modified CAR+ T cells and TCR therapies by controlling cell expansion and activation in the body, minimizing off-target\nand unwanted on-target\neffects and toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. The term of the MD Anderson License expires on the last to occur of (a) the expiration of all patents licensed thereunder, or (b) the twentieth anniversary of the date of the MD Anderson License; provided, however, that following the expiration of the term, we and PGEN shall then have a fully-paid up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable license to use the licensed intellectual property thereunder.\nAfter 10 years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 90-day\ncure period, MD Anderson will have the right to convert the MD Anderson License into a non-exclusive\nlicense if we and PGEN are not using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed intellectual property on a case-by-case\nbasis. After five years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 180-day\ncure period, MD Anderson will have the right to terminate the MD Anderson License with respect to specific technology(ies) funded by the government\nor subject to a third-party contract if we and PGEN are not meeting the diligence requirements in such funding agreement or contract, as applicable. MD Anderson may also terminate the agreement with written notice upon material breach by us or PGEN, if such breach has not been cured within 60 days of receiving such notice. In addition, the MD Anderson License will terminate upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events for both us or PGEN and may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of us, PGEN and MD Anderson.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully perform under the MD Anderson License and if the MD Anderson License is terminated it may prevent us from achieving our business objectives.\nWe are partly reliant on the National Cancer Institute for research and development and early clinical testing of certain of our product candidates.\nA portion of our research and development is being conducted by the NCI under the CRADA entered into in January 2017 and amended in February 2019. Under the CRADA, the NCI, with Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg as the principal investigator, is responsible for conducting a clinical trial using the Sleeping Beauty\nsystem to express TCRs for the treatment of solid tumors. We have limited control over the nature or timing of the NCI\u2019s clinical trial and limited visibility into their day-to-day\nactivities, including with respect to how they are providing and\nadministering T cell therapy. For example, the research we are funding constitutes only a small portion of the NCI\u2019s overall research. Additionally, other research being conducted by Dr. Rosenberg may at times receive higher priority than research on our program. Further, in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the NCI has taken precautionary measures that have delayed the enrollment of the TCR-T\nclinical trial using the Sleeping Beauty\nsystem to express TCRs for the treatment of solid tumors. In addition, enrollment in this clinical trial has been temporarily suspended due to issues internal to NCI and unrelated to our technology. The progress and timeline, including the timeline for dosing patients, for this trial are under the control of the NCI.\nThe CRADA terminates on January 9, 2022 unless it is extended in writing by the parties, and either party may terminate the CRADA by providing at least 60 days\u2019 prior written notice to the other party. If the NCI unilaterally terminates the CRADA or the CRADA lapses without any extension, part or all of the research and development of the Sleeping Beauty\nsystem conducted at the NCI would be suspended, and the research and development of our TCR program would be impacted.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design, initiate and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design, initiate and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial start-up\nand process itself is also time-consuming and results are inherently uncertain. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to delay the start of, abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nAdditional nonclinical data requests by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nUnforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nDetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nLack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nSlower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nInability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022\nInability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022\nRegulatory determinations to temporarily or permanently cease enrollment for other reasons not related to patient safety.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. In addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our IND submission or in the conduct of these trials.\nSee also \u201cRisks Related to the Clinical Testing, Regulatory Approval and Manufacturing of our Product Candidates-Our product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials, which are very expensive and time-consuming. We cannot be certain when we will be able to submit a BLA, to the FDA and any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business.\u201d\nWe may not be able to commercialize any products, generate significant revenues, or attain profitability.\nTo date, none of our product candidates have been approved for commercial sale in any country. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize potential product candidates is long, complex, and costly. Unless and until we receive approval from the FDA and/or other foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our products and will not have product revenues. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, if we are unable to successfully commercialize our products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability, or to continue our business without raising significant additional capital, which may not be available. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nWe have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022\nContinuing to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nParticipating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u2022\nFormulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u2022\nConducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary product candidates, and undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nWe may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations, which failure could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products and complementary technologies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive and, therefore, we anticipate exploring collaborations with third parties that have alternative technologies, more resources and more experience than we do. In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaboration arrangement for a product candidate or complementary technology, we may also seek to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaboration arrangement for such product candidate or technology. There are a limited number of potential partners, and we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate partners. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on reasonable and acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and/or effectively market and sell future approved products, if any, in some or all of the territories outside of the United States where it may otherwise be valuable to do so.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our growth.\nIn the future, if we are able to advance our product candidates to the point of, and thereafter through, clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide for these capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems, and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business may be harmed.\nOur business will subject us to the risk of liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur contract research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require our contractors to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will need to attract, recruit and hire key executives and we will continue to rely on key scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe have recently experienced significant turnover among our executive team and will need to attract and hire key executives to help lead our company. On February 25, 2021, our Board appointed Heidi Hagen, formerly our lead independent director, as our interim Chief Executive Officer and principal executive officer to replace Dr. Laurence J.N. Cooper. In December 2020, Satyavrat Shukla resigned from his position as our Chief Financial Officer. On February 17, 2021, we appointed Timothy Cunningham as our interim Chief Financial Officer and principal financial officer. We have commenced searches for a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; however, the marketplace for attracting senior executives is competitive and identifying and hiring new executives may take several months or longer. Management transition is often difficult and inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge. The departure of these executives or an extended delay finding replacements may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to execute our business strategies may also be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with these transitions.\nIn addition, we may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe are highly dependent on our principal scientific, regulatory, and medical advisors. The loss of any of our key personnel, could result in delays in product development, loss of key personnel or partnerships, and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our officers or key employees.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical and clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, and eventually, sales and marketing. We compete for\nqualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products, if approved. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nDecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nInjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of prior governmental approvals;\n\u2022\nCosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nSubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u2022\nProduct recalls;\n\u2022\nLoss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nThe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance. However, an inability to renew our policies or to obtain sufficient insurance at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products that we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE CLINICAL TESTING, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nIf we are unable to obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, our business will suffer.\nWe may not be able to obtain the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates, or any product candidate that we may acquire or develop in the future for commercial sale. We will need FDA approval to\ncommercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions equivalent to the FDA to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA a Biologics License Application, or BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depending upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and will require substantial resources for research, development, and testing. We cannot predict whether our research, development, and clinical approaches will result in products that the FDA will consider safe for humans and effective for their intended uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation, or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\nDelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nImpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022\nDiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our BLAs. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any potential revenue source, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate or that we will obtain FDA approval if we are able to do so.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we similarly must receive approval from applicable regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any of our product candidates. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials, which are very expensive and time-consuming. We cannot be certain when we will be able to submit a BLA to the FDA and any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of development and require extensive clinical testing. Notwithstanding our current clinical trial plans for each of our existing product candidates, we may not be able to commence additional trials or see results from these trials within our anticipated timelines. As they enter later stages of development, our product candidates generally will become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and controls for product candidates entering Phase 3 clinical trials. There is no guarantee the FDA will allow us to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for product candidates studied in early clinical trials.\nIf the FDA does not allow our product candidates to enter later stage clinical trials, or requires changes to the formulation or manufacture of our product candidates before commencing Phase 3 clinical trials, our ability to further develop, or seek approval for, such product candidates may be materially impacted. As such, we cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit a BLA for regulatory approval of our product candidates or whether such a BLA will be accepted. Because we do not anticipate generating revenues unless and until we submit one or more BLAs and thereafter obtain requisite FDA approvals, the timing of our BLA submissions and FDA determinations regarding approval thereof, will directly affect if and when we are able to generate revenues.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nAs with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or events, including potential adverse side effects related to cytokine release. If our product candidates or similar products or product candidates under development by third parties demonstrate unacceptable AEs, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. The FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. For instance, Ad-RTS-hIL-12\nplus veledimex may result in local reactions during the time of injection, including severe swelling and bleeding. If a serious adverse event was to occur in any of our clinical trials, including in our trial of Ad-RTS-hIL-12\nplus veledimex for the treatment of DIPG, the FDA may place a hold on the clinical trial for this indication and, potentially, our clinical trials of Ad-RTS-hIL-12\nplus veledimex in other indications.\nThe product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately or timely recognized or managed by the treating medical staff, particularly outside of the institutions that collaborate with us, as toxicities resulting from our novel technologies may not be normally encountered in the general patient population and by medical personnel. We expect to have to train medical personnel using our product candidates to understand their side effect profiles, both for our planned clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any product candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in adverse effects to patients, including death.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, including during any long-term follow-up\nobservation period recommended or required for patients who receive treatment using our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved. Furthermore, any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nOur cell-based and gene therapy immuno-oncology products rely on the availability of reagents, specialized equipment, and other specialty materials and infrastructure, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. For some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely or may rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors, which could impair our ability to manufacture and supply our products.\nManufacturing our product candidates will require many reagents, which are substances used in our manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and\nequipment used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under current good manufacturing practices by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped\nto support our needs. We also do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing.\nFor some of these reagents, equipment, infrastructure, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to conduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business.\nIn addition, some of the reagents and products used by us, including in our clinical trials, may be stored at a single vendor. The loss of materials located at a single vendor, or the failure of such a vendor to manufacture clinical product in accordance with our specifications, would impact our ability to conduct ongoing or planned clinical trials and continue the development of our products. Further, manufacturing replacement material may be expensive and require a significant amount of time, which may further impact our clinical programs.\nAs we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are able to alter our process so as to use other materials or equipment, such a change may lead to a delay in our clinical development and/or commercialization plans. If such a change occurs for product candidate that is already in clinical testing, the change may require us to perform both ex vivo comparability studies and to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support approval of our product candidates. The FDA normally expects two randomized, well-controlled Phase 3 pivotal trials in support of approval of a BLA. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be certain that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for the indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our BLAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nOur immuno-oncology product candidates are based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. Currently, few gene therapy and cell therapy products have been approved in the United States and Europe.\nWe are currently focused on developing products in immuno-oncology that employ novel gene expression, control and cell technologies to deliver safe, effective and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. Due to the novelty of this technology, there can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our immuno-oncology platforms will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience unanticipated problems or delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity or transferring our manufacturing process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our immuno-oncology product candidates on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nIn addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. These factors make it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or Europe. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an institution, that institution\u2019s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our immuno-oncology product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected for oncology product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.\nBecause we are dependent upon clinical research institutions and other contractors for clinical testing and for research and development activities, the results of our clinical trials and such research activities are, to a certain extent, beyond our control.\nWe materially rely upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our product development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA applications, if any, and our introduction of new products, if any, will be delayed. These institutions may also have, or implement in the future, policies and procedures that limit their ability to advance our programs. For instance, our partners may take measures in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, that may impact enrollment in our clinical trials. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors to our detriment, our competitive position would be harmed.\nOur reliance on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates exposes us to a number of risks that may delay the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs.\nWe have limited experience in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. We currently lack the internal resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates and, therefore, contract the manufacture of our product candidates with third parties. We intend to contract with one or more manufacturers to manufacture, supply,\nstore, and distribute supplies for our clinical trials. If a product candidate we develop or acquire in the future receives FDA approval, we may rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our products. Our\nanticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u2022\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our products in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any.\n\u2022\nOur future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products.\n\u2022\nBiopharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u2022\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.\n\u2022\nFurther third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control, and quality assurance and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel and obtaining materials for our product candidates, including delays or shortages due to limited supply or capacity of production facilities as a result of the recent COVID-19\npandemic.\n\u2022\nOur third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, among other things, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved uses, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of our approved products. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label\nuse and if we market our products outside of their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label\nmarketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown AEs or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nLitigation involving patients taking our product;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nRequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nWarning letters;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nRefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nRecall of products;\n\u2022\nFines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nSuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nDamage to relationships with existing and potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nUnfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nRefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nProduct seizure; or\n\u2022\nInjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNoncompliance with requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements regarding the development of products for pediatric populations and the protection of personal health information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nIf we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nWe currently have no marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. If, and when we become reasonably certain that we will be able to commercialize our current or future product candidates, we anticipate allocating resources to the marketing, sales and distribution of our proposed products in North America and in certain other countries; however, we cannot assure that we will be able to market, sell, and distribute our products successfully. Our future success also may depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities and to encourage the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development, and such\ncollaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. Although we intend to pursue certain collaborative arrangements regarding the sale and marketing of certain of our product candidates, there are no assurances that we will be able to establish or maintain collaborative arrangements or, if we are able to do so, whether we would be able to conduct our own sales efforts. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house\nsales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our product candidates in the United States or overseas.\nIf we are not able to partner with a third party and are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our product candidates, which would harm our business. If we rely on pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion\nor other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties that may not be successful and that will be only partially in our control.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other biopharmaceutical companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If a product candidate receives FDA approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future products and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have products already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022\nDeveloping drugs and biopharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nUndertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nObtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs and biopharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nFormulating and manufacturing drugs and biopharmaceuticals; and\n\u2022\nLaunching, marketing, and selling drugs and biopharmaceuticals.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our product candidates, our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be materially impaired.\nEven if the FDA and/or foreign equivalents thereof approve our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nPerceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\nPharmacological benefit and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u2022\nAvailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products from government or other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any; and\n\u2022\nThe price at which we sell our products.\nBecause we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of a product to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing in order to fund the development of future product candidates.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our products do not obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from payors.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from third-party payors, including government and health administration authorities, private health maintenance organizations and health insurers and other payors.\nPatients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors are critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. It is difficult to predict the coverage and reimbursement decisions that will be made by third-party payors for novel gene and cell therapy products such as ours. Even if we obtain coverage for our product candidates, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments\nthat patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement, which might not include all of the FDA-approved\ndrugs for a particular indication. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our products and\npatients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.\nIn addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S.\njurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe market opportunities for our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line, or third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small molecules, or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery, and new technologies. We expect to initially seek approval of our product candidates as a third line therapy for patients who have failed other approved treatments.\nSubsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval as a second line therapy and potentially as a first line therapy, but there is no guarantee that our product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for second line or first line therapy. In addition, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials prior to gaining approval for second line or first line therapy.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates.\nOur market opportunities may also be limited by competitor treatments that may enter the market. See also \u201cRisks Related to Our Ability to Commercialize Our Product Candidates-If we cannot compete successfully for market share against other biopharmaceutical companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer\n.\u201d\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory enactments in recent years that change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our future ability to sell our product candidates profitably.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Most significantly, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which included measures that have significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022\nCreated an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nIncreased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\nCreated a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale\ndiscounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nExtended manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nCreated new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extensions;\n\u2022\nExpanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nExpanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nCreated a new requirement to annually report drug samples that certain manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022\nExpanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nCreated a licensure framework for follow-on\nbiologic products;\n\u2022\nCreated new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for certain drug manufacturers to annually report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nCreated a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u2022\nEstablished a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nThere have been executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. In December 2017,\nCongress repealed the tax penalty, effective January 1, 2019, for an individual\u2019s failure to maintain ACA-mandated health insurance as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act. Further, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and effective January 1, 2021 also eliminated the health insurance tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA and our business. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform measures on the U.S. healthcare industry is unclear.\nThere have been executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA.

It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA and our business. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform measures on the U.S. healthcare industry is unclear.\nFurther, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. As a result, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals.\nThe FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nIt is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, which may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or if we receive regulatory approval, commercialize our products.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. For example, we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other\nentities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act which permits a private individual acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on entities and individuals subject to the law including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as individuals and entities that perform services for them which involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, known as business associates and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nRequirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to report annually to CMS certain financial arrangements with physicians, (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to teaching hospitals, and physicians, as defined by such law and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, which will be expanded beginning in 2022, to require applicable manufacturers to report such information regarding its relationships with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and\n\u2022\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfer of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our consulting agreements with physicians, some of whom receive stock or stock options as compensation for their services, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has further strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or\nservices resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nTo the extent that any of our product candidates is ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in United States federal or state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nOur immuno-oncology product candidates may face competition in the future from biosimilars.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of follow-on\nbiological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Further, this data exclusivity does not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the original branded product, generating its own data and seeking approval. Data exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely upon the data within the innovator\u2019s application to support the biosimilar product\u2019s approval.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology or loss of data, including any cyber security incidents, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability which could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we, our contract research organizations and other third parties on which we rely collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Because of the work-from-home policies we implemented due to COVID-19, information that is normally protected, including company confidential information, may be less secure. Additionally, despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, breaches, unauthorized access, interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, or damage from natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enabled many of our employees to work remotely, which may make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Any such event could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed\nby unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research, development and commercialization activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy, any of which could adversely affect our business. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we or our licensors fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish and our ability to successfully commercialize our products may be impaired.\nOur success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve confidential information, including trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nTo date, we have exclusive rights in the field of cancer treatment to certain U.S. and foreign intellectual property with respect to certain cell therapy and related technologies from MD Anderson and NCI, as well as with respect to the PGEN technology, including Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex. Under the MD Anderson License, future filings and applications require the agreement of each of MD Anderson, PGEN and us, and MD Anderson has the right to control the preparation and filing of additional patent applications unless the parties agree that we or PGEN may prosecute the application directly. Although under the agreement MD Anderson has agreed to review and incorporate any reasonable comments that we or PGEN may have regarding licensed patents and patent applications, we cannot guarantee that our comments will be solicited or followed. Under the patent license agreement with the NCI, the NCI is responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of patent applications or patents licensed to us. Although under the agreement, the NCI is required to consult with us in the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of all patent applications or patents licensed to us, we cannot guarantee that our comments will be solicited or followed. Under our License Agreement with PGEN, PGEN has the right, but not the obligation, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain the patents and patent applications licensed to us and shall bear any related costs incurred by it in regard to those actions. PGEN is required to consult with us and keep us reasonably informed of the status of the patents and patent applications licensed to us, and to confer with us prior to submitting any related filings and correspondence. Although under the agreement PGEN has agreed to consider in good faith and consult with us regarding any comments we may have regarding these patents and patent applications, we cannot guarantee that our comments will be solicited or followed. Without direct control of the in-licensed patents and patent applications, we are dependent on MD Anderson, the NCI or PGEN, as applicable, to keep us advised of prosecution, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where prosecution information may not be publicly available. We anticipate that we, MD Anderson, the NCI and PGEN will file additional patent applications both in the United States and in other countries. However, we cannot predict or guarantee:\n\u2022\nThe degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents;\n\u2022\nIf and when patents will be issued;\n\u2022\nWhether or not others will obtain patents claiming subject matter related to or relevant to our product candidates; or\n\u2022\nWhether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. We may also require the cooperation of our licensors in order to enforce the licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.\nChanges in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law, resulting in a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained, and with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future. As the USPTO continues to implement the Leahy-Smith Act, and as the federal courts have the opportunity to interpret the Leahy-Smith Act, the laws and regulations governing patents, and the rules regarding patent procurement could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nCertain technologies utilized in our research and development programs are already in the public domain. Moreover, a number of our competitors have developed technologies, filed patent applications or obtained patents on technologies, compositions and methods of use that are related to our business and may cover or conflict with our owned or licensed patent applications, technologies or product candidates. Such conflicts could limit the scope of the patents that we may be able to obtain or may result in the rejection of claims in our patent applications. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and\nproducts. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, our own earlier filed patents and applications or those of MD Anderson, NCI or PGEN may limit the scope of later patents we obtain or may result in the rejection of claims in our later filed patent applications. If third parties filed patent applications or obtained patents on technologies, compositions and methods of use that are related to our business and that cover or conflict with our owned or licensed patent applications, technologies or product candidates, we may be required to challenge such protection, terminate or modify our programs impacted by such protection or obtain licenses from such third parties, which might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing\nmanner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our confidential information, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors, as well as our licensors and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how\nand our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, and to maintain our competitive position, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, it is our general policy to require our employees, consultants, advisors, and contractors to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how,\nconfidential information or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches of these agreements. Our trade secrets or other confidential information may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or other confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets or other confidential information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, know-how\nor other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how\nand other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our products.\nIn order to protect or enforce patent rights, we may initiate patent infringement litigation against third parties. Similarly, we may be sued by others for patent infringement. We also may become subject to proceedings\nconducted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including interference proceedings to determine the priority or derivation of inventions, or post-grant review, inter partes review, or reexamination proceedings reviewing the patentability of our patented claims. In addition, any foreign patents that are granted may become subject to opposition, nullity, or revocation proceedings in foreign jurisdictions having such proceedings. The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel away from their normal responsibilities.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. While no such litigation has been brought against us and we have not been held by any court to have infringed a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that our products or use of our products do not infringe third-party patents. It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our products or the use of our products.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. A patent does not protect its owner from a claim of infringement of another owner\u2019s patent. Therefore, our patent position cannot and does not provide any assurance that we are not infringing the patent rights of another.\nThe patent landscape in the field of immuno-oncology is particularly complex. We are aware of numerous United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications of third parties that cover compositions, methods of use and methods of manufacture of immuno-oncology products. In addition, there may be patents and patent applications in the field of which we are not aware. The technology we license from MD Anderson, NCI and PGEN is early-stage technology and we are in the process of designing and developing products using this technology. Although we will seek to avoid pursuing the development of products that may infringe any patent claims that we believe to be valid and enforceable, we may fail to do so. Moreover, given the breadth and number of claims in patents and pending patent applications in the field of immuno-oncology and the complexities and uncertainties associated with them, third parties may allege that we are infringing patent claims even if we do not believe such claims to be valid and enforceable.\nIf a claim for patent infringement is asserted, there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue marketing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If we do not successfully defend any infringement actions to which we become a party or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages, which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful, or we may be required to discontinue or significantly delay commercialization and development of the affected products.\nAny legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin developmental or marketing activities relating to affected products could, in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages, require us or our collaborators to obtain licenses to continue to develop, manufacture, or market the affected products. Such a license may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nAn adverse determination in a proceeding involving our owned or licensed intellectual property may allow entry of substitutes, including biosimilar or generic substitutes, for our products.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits,\nnon-payment\nof fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe license rights to products and technology that are important to our business, and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For instance, we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications under the MD Anderson License and our patent license agreement with the NCI as well as under our License Agreement with PGEN. Under these agreements, we are subject to a range of commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, patent prosecution and maintenance, insurance and other obligations.\nAny failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of our license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or business. Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, such dispute could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of potential products and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. On termination we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed.\nIn addition, in certain cases, the rights licensed to us are rights of a third party licensed to our licensor. In such instances, if our licensors do not comply with their obligations under such licenses, our rights under our license agreements with our licensor may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how\nof others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOTHER RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nPrice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nChanges in operating results and performance and stock market valuations of other biopharmaceutical companies generally, or those that develop and commercialize cancer drugs in particular;\n\u2022\nMarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nPreclinical studies or clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nPublic concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or others;\n\u2022\nThe financial or operational projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nComments by securities analysts or changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC, as well as announcements of the status of development of our products, announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or our competitors, announcements regarding collaborative agreements and other announcements relating to product development, litigation and intellectual property impacting us or our business;\n\u2022\nGovernment regulation;\n\u2022\nFDA determinations on the approval of a product candidate BLA submission;\n\u2022\nThe sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nFuture sales of our common stock by us, our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of mergers or acquisition transactions;\n\u2022\nOur inclusion or deletion from certain stock indices;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nChanges in reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of medical innovations or new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of changes in our senior management or directors;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic, industry, political and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the ongoing impact of the COVID 19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nOther events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting principles.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and our stock in particular from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Public debt\nand equity markets, and in particular the Nasdaq Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many biopharmaceutical companies.\nStock prices of many biopharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources, and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and hinder a takeover attempt, and limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with a party that owns at least 15% of its common stock unless the business combination is approved by the company\u2019s board of directors before the person acquires the 15% ownership stake or later by its board of directors and two-thirds\nof its stockholders. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends, you will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until you sell your shares at profit.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in us will be realized, if at all, only when you sell shares of our common stock.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted.\nWe have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and research and development tax credits, or R&D credits, as a result of our incurrence of losses and our conduct of research activities since inception. We generally are able to carry NOLs and R&D credits forward to reduce our tax liability in future years. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs and R&D credits is subject to the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, respectively. Those sections generally restrict the use of NOLs and R&D credits after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under Section 382 of the code and the United States Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over the applicable testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carry forwards and Section 383 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of tax a corporation may offset with business credit (including the R&D credit) carry forwards.\nWe may have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 in the past and there can be no assurance that we will not experience additional ownership changes in the future. As a result, our NOLs and business credits (including the R&D credit) may be subject to limitations and we may be required to pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our NOLs or R&D credits were freely usable.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nRecently, we were engaged in a consent solicitation led by WaterMill Asset Management Corp. where two new directors were added to our Board. We could experience other stockholder activism in the future, including another consent solicitation or a proxy contest. Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at our company. In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, and customers.\nIn addition, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, which would be disruptive to our business. If individuals are elected to our Board with a differing agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected.\nOur principal stockholders, executive officers and directors have substantial control over the company, which may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may harm the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 49.6% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have interests that conflict with our other stockholders and, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\nDelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;\n\u2022\nImpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\nDiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock should investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of common stock in a company that has such concentrated ownership.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019, which we believe has been fully remediated. If we have inadequately remediated this material weakness, or we otherwise fail to develop, implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls in future periods, our ability to report our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected and may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or could have a material adverse effect on our business and trading price of our securities.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Market. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness was related to the design and maintenance of effective controls relating to the monitoring and oversight of expensing third party clinical trial costs. Specifically, our internal controls were not designed effectively to provide reasonable assurance regarding the accurate and timely evaluation of the amount of third-party costs to record.\nTo remediate the material weakness described above and prevent similar deficiencies in the future, throughout 2020 we added additional controls and procedures, including: (i) implementation of monthly meeting between the finance and clinical departments to review accruals, material contracts, pre-authorized work and material pass-through costs, (ii) monthly contract meetings with the legal department to review the terms of material contracts, including leases, and (iii) engaging a third-party to perform an evaluation to ascertain whether the components of internal control were present and functioning throughout the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nIf we have inadequately remediated this material weakness, there will continue to be an increased risk that our future financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal controls could reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of resources to comply with applicable requirements. For more information relating to our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of the Annual Report.\nWe cannot assure you that material weaknesses or material deficiencies will not occur in the future and that we will be able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See the related risk factor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We are in the process of designing and implementing measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness. In addition, we are providing in-house accounting personnel training to ensure that they have the relevant expertise related to the monitoring and oversight of expensing third party clinical trial costs. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in 2017 could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, that significantly revises the Code. The federal income tax law is referred to as the Tax Act, and contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. The CARES Act, enacted in 2020, modified certain of these tax changes, and enacted other tax changes applicable to corporations. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act and the CARES Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. The impact of the Tax Act and the CARES Act on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91488, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ZIOP"}
