{"cik": "1611983", "company": "Liberty Broadband Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our current and future financial obligations, including to make debt service obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements (defined below), and other contractual commitments depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary TruePosition, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, available funds under the Margin Loan Agreements (which was none as of December 31, 2015) and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. The proceeds from the rights offering, which closed in the first quarter of 2015, is our current primary source of cash. In addition, the ability of our only operating subsidiary to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on its operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which it may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities.\nCharter generated approximately $2,359 million, $2,359 million and $2,158 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Charter uses the cash it generates from its operations primarily to fund its business operations and to service its debt and other financial obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Charter generates unless Charter declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash (subject to any contractual restrictions on our ability to participate in any such repurchase) or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Historically, Charter has not paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in Charter\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that Charter will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nIn connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we have outstanding borrowings of $400 million at December 31, 2015 under two margin loan agreements (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreements\u201d) entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband (\u201cBroadbandSPV\u201d). The obligations under the Margin Loan Agreements are guaranteed solely by our company and are secured by a portion of our ownership interest in Charter. Such equity interests are held through BroadbandSPV. The terms of the Margin Loan Agreements limit our company\u2019s ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms, and our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon the operating performance of our subsidiary, TruePosition, the value of our investment in Charter, prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms or at all. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business or market opportunities as they arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nI-24\nWe have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with BroadbandSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which BroadbandSPV has outstanding $400 million at December 31, 2015. As a result of this significant indebtedness, our company may:\n\u00b7\nExperience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nBe required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nBe handicapped in its ability to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses; and\n\u00b7\nBe exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of its indebtedness.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. For additional limitations on our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments\u201d and \u201cWe do not have access to the cash that Charter generates from its operating activities\u201d above.\nThe agreements that govern our current and future indebtedness may contain various affirmative and restrictive covenants that will limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nAs discussed above, in connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreements as the guarantor with BroadbandSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which BroadbandSPV has outstanding $400 million and has none available to be drawn at December 31, 2015. The Margin Loan Agreements contain various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness by BroadbandSPV, enter into financing arrangements with respect to the portion of stock of Charter pledged to secure the loans under the Margin Loan Agreements, and cause BroadbandSPV to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock of Charter and other assets as permitted under the Margin Loan documents. We may also enter into certain other indebtedness arrangements in the future. The instruments governing such indebtedness, often contain covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur more debt, exceed specified leverage ratios, pay dividends, make distributions, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, and transfer or sell assets. Any failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on Charter to provide us with the financial information that we use in accounting for our ownership interest in Charter as well as information regarding Charter that we include in our public filings.\nWe account for our approximately 26% ownership interest in Charter using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, in our financial statements we record our share of Charter\u2019s net income or loss. Within the meaning of U.S. accounting rules, we rely on Charter to provide us with financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which we use in the application of the equity method. We also rely on Charter to provide us with the information regarding their company that we include in our public filings. In addition, we cannot change the way in which Charter reports its financial results or require Charter to change its internal controls over financial reporting. No assurance can be given that Charter will provide us with the information necessary to enable us to complete our public filings on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, any material misstatements or omissions in the information Charter provides to us or publicly files could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and filing status under federal securities laws.\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe we are currently subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, because our investment in Charter enables us to exercise significant influence over Charter. We have substantial involvement in the management and affairs of Charter, including through our board nominees. We nominated four of Charter\u2019s ten current directors. In connection with the proposed Bright House Transaction, on May 23, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated\nI-25\nStockholders Agreement (the \u201cSecond Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement\u201d) with Charter, New Charter and A/N Partnership, which continues to provide us with board nomination rights. If, however, our investment in Charter were deemed to become passive (such as in the event that our equity interest were significantly diluted and our nominees ceased to serve as directors of Charter), we could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting and could restrict our activities going forward. Our restated charter includes a provision that would enable us, at the option of our board of directors, to automatically convert each outstanding share of our Series B common stock into one share of our Series A common stock at such time as we have outstanding less than 20% of the total number of shares of our Series B common stock issued in the Broadband Spin-Off. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, any violation of this act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty, Liberty Interactive and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Broadband Spin-Off, the September 2011 separation of Starz from Liberty and the January 2013 spin-off of Liberty from Starz, most of the executive officers of Broadband also serve as executive officers of Liberty, Liberty Interactive and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (\u201cTripCo\u201d) and there are overlapping directors. None of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty, Liberty Interactive, TripCo or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty, Liberty Interactive or TripCo pursues acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Our company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that no director or officer of our company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to our company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty, Liberty Interactive and TripCo) instead of our company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to our company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company or as a director or officer of any of our subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which our company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty or Liberty Interactive and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty, Liberty Interactive or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nOur inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty pursuant to which it will provide to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we will reimburse them on a fixed fee basis. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Broadband Spin-Off.\nI-26\nFactors Relating to Charter\nThe following risks relate specifically to our equity affiliate Charter. If any of these risks were realized, they could have a material adverse effect on the value of our equity interests in Charter, which could negatively impact our stock price and our financial prospects.\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect its financial health and ability to react to changes in its business.\nCharter has a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in each of its debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2015, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion including $21.8 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction.\nAs a result of this significant indebtedness, Charter may:\n\u00b7\nBe impacted in its ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;\n\u00b7\nBe vulnerable to interest rate increases because approximately 28% of its borrowings are, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7\nBe exposed to increased interest expense to the extent it refinances existing debt with higher cost debt;\n\u00b7\nBe required to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flow from operating activities to make payments on its debt, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;\n\u00b7\nExperience limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in Charter\u2019s business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;\n\u00b7\nBe placed at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that have proportionately less debt; and\n\u00b7\nBe adversely affected by Charter\u2019s relationship with customers and suppliers.\nIf current debt amounts increase, the related risks that Charter faces will intensify.\nThe agreements and instruments governing Charter\u2019s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect Charter\u2019s ability to operate its business, as well as significantly affect its liquidity.\nCharter\u2019s credit facilities and the indentures governing its debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to operate its business, liquidity and results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, Charter and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;\n\u00b7\nissue equity;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7\ndispose of assets or merge;\n\u00b7\nenter into related party transactions; and\n\u00b7\ngrant liens and pledge assets.\nAdditionally, the Charter Communications Operating, LLC (\u201cCharter Operating\u201d) credit facilities require Charter Operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. The breach of any\nI-27\ncovenants or obligations in its indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing Charter\u2019s long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the Charter Operating credit facilities, CCO Safari III credit facilities and the holders of the CCO Safari II notes could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in Charter\u2019s subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.\nCharter depends on generating sufficient cash flow to fund its debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.\nCharter is dependent on its cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund its debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nCharter\u2019s ability to service its debt and to fund its planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on its ability to continue to generate cash flow and its access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. Charter\u2019s ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nits ability to sustain and grow revenue and cash flow from operations by offering video, Internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in its markets and to maintain and grow its customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, digital subscriber line \u201cDSL\u201d providers, video provided over the Internet and providers of advertising over the Internet;\n\u00b7\ngeneral business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;\n\u00b7\nCharter\u2019s ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);\n\u00b7\nthe development and deployment of new products and technologies, including Charter\u2019s cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide\u00ae and downloadable security for set-top boxes;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of governmental regulation on its business or potential business combination transactions; and\n\u00b7\nany events that disrupt Charter\u2019s networks, information systems or properties and impair its operating activities and negatively impact its reputation.\nSome of these factors are beyond Charter\u2019s control. If it is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or it is unable to access additional liquidity sources, Charter may not be able to service and repay its debt, operate its business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund its other liquidity and capital needs.\nRestrictions in Charter\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to Charter and its subsidiaries that are debt issuers.\nCharter\u2019s primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Charter\u2019s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on its notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. Charter Operating\u2019s ability to make distributions to Charter, CCO Holdings (comprised of CCO Holdings, LLC and CCO Holdings Capital Corp.), CCOH Safari, LLC (\u201cCCOH Safari\u201d), CCO Safari II, LLC (\u201cCCO Safari II\u201d) or CCO Safari III, LLC (\u201cCCO Safari III\u201d), its other primary debt issuers, to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the \u201cDLLCA\u201d), Charter\u2019s subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has \u201csurplus\u201d as defined in the DLLCA. Under fraudulent transfer laws, Charter\u2019s subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:\nI-28\n\u00b7\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;\n\u00b7\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u00b7\nit could not pay its debts as they became due.\nWhile Charter believes that its relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. Charter\u2019s direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers and guarantors under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the entities that will be issuers and guarantors under the CCO Safari II notes upon consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger. CCOH Safari and CCO Holdings are each an obligor under their respective senior notes and CCO Safari III is an obligor under its credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion.\nIn the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of its subsidiaries, that subsidiary\u2019s assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. In that event, the lenders under Charter Operating's credit facilities, the CCO Safari II notes and any other indebtedness of Charter\u2019s subsidiaries whose interests are (or will be following the consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger) secured by substantially all of Charter\u2019s operating assets, and all holders of other debt of Charter Operating, CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III, CCO Holdings and CCOH Safari will have the right to be paid in full before Charter from any of its subsidiaries' assets.\nSome of Charter\u2019s outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. It may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness following a change of control, which would place Charter in default under the applicable debt instruments.\nCharter may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill its obligations under its notes and its credit facilities following a change of control. Under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings\u2019 notes and CCOH Safari\u2019s notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. However, Charter may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes and Charter Operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. In addition, a change of control under the Charter Operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities, which would trigger a default under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings\u2019 notes and CCO Safari II notes. Because such credit facilities and notes are obligations of Charter Operating and its subsidiaries, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before Charter Operating\u2019s assets could be available to CCO Holdings or CCOH Safari to repurchase their notes. Any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place CCO Holdings or CCOH Safari in default under its notes. The failure of Charter\u2019s subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default.\nCharter operates in a very competitive business environment, which affects its ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect its business, operations and financial results.\nThe industry in which Charter operates is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. In some instances, Charter competes against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of its competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale. Charter could also face additional competition from multi-channel video providers if they began distributing video over the Internet to customers residing outside their current territories.\nCharter\u2019s principal competitors for video services throughout its territory are direct broadcast satellite (\u201cDBS\u201d) providers. The two largest DBS providers are DirecTV (which is owned by AT&T) and DISH Network. Competition from DBS, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased HD broadcasting has had an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s ability to retain customers. DBS companies have also expanded their activities in the MDU market.\nI-29\nTelephone companies, including two major telephone companies, AT&T and Verizon, offer video and other services in competition with Charter, and it expects they will increasingly do so in the future. Upgraded portions of these networks carry two-way video, data services and provide digital voice services similar to those provided by Charter. In the case of Verizon, high-speed data services (fiber optic service \u201cFiOS\u201d) offer speeds as high as or higher than Charter\u2019s data services. In addition, these companies continue to offer their traditional telephone services, as well as service bundles that include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. Based on its internal estimates, Charter believes that AT&T (excluding DirecTV) and Verizon are offering video services in areas serving approximately 35% and 4%, respectively, of its estimated passings and it has experienced customer losses in these areas. When AT&T or Verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video products in Charter\u2019s market areas, Charter has seen a decrease in its video revenue as AT&T and Verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaigns to launch their products. AT&T\u2019s acquisition of DirectTV, the nation\u2019s largest DBS provider, created an even larger competitor for Charter\u2019s video services that has the ability to expand its video service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings.\nDue to consumer electronic innovations, content owners are allowing consumers to watch Internet-delivered content on televisions, personal computers, tablets, gaming boxes connected to televisions and mobile devices, some without charging a fee to access the content. Technological advancements, such as video-on-demand, new video formats, and Internet streaming and downloading, have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers, and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. For example, online video services continue to offer consumers alternatives including Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and Apple. In 2015, HBO and CBS began selling their programming direct to consumers over the Internet. DISH Network has also launched Sling TV which includes ESPN among other programming, and Sony launched PlayStation Vue which includes more than 85 TV channels. The increasing number of choices available to audiences could also negatively impact advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from Charter, as well as the price they are willing to pay for advertising.\nWith respect to Charter\u2019s Internet access services, Charter faces competition, including intensive marketing efforts and aggressive pricing, from telephone companies, primarily AT&T and Verizon, and other providers of DSL, fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-home services. DSL service competes with its Internet service and is often offered at prices lower than its Internet services, although often at speeds lower than the speeds Charter offers. Fiber-to-the-node networks can provide faster Internet speeds than conventional DSL, but still cannot typically match Charter\u2019s Internet speeds. Fiber-to-the-home networks, however, can provide Internet speeds equal to or greater than Charter\u2019s current Internet speeds. In addition, in many of its markets, DSL providers have entered into co-marketing arrangements with DBS providers to offer service bundles combining video services provided by a DBS provider with DSL and traditional telephone and wireless services offered by the telephone companies and their affiliates. These service bundles offer customers pricing and convenience advantages similar to Charter\u2019s bundles.\nContinued growth in the residential voice business faces risks. The competitive landscape for residential and commercial telephone services is intense; Charter faces competition from providers of Internet telephone services, as well as incumbent telephone companies. Further, Charter faces increasing competition for residential voice services as more consumers in the United States are replacing traditional telephone service with wireless service. Charter expects to continue to price its voice product aggressively as part of its triple play strategy which could negatively impact its revenue from voice services to the extent it does not increase volume.\nThe existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is referred to as an overbuild. Overbuilds could adversely affect Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. Charter is aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of its markets, however, it is unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.\nIn order to attract new customers, from time to time Charter makes promotional offers, including offers of temporarily reduced price or free service. These promotional programs result in significant advertising, programming and operating expenses, and also may require it to make capital expenditures to acquire and install customer premises equipment. Customers who subscribe to Charter\u2019s services as a result of these offerings may not remain customers following the end of the promotional period. A failure to retain customers could have a material adverse effect on Charter\u2019s business.\nMergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchised, wireless, or private cable operators, DBS providers, local exchange carriers, and others, may provide additional benefits to some of Charter\u2019s competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with Charter.\nI-30\nIn addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, Charter\u2019s business competes with all other sources of entertainment and information delivery, including broadcast television, movies, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, console games, print media, and the Internet. If Charter does not respond appropriately to further increases in the leisure and entertainment choices available to consumers, its competitive position could deteriorate, and its financial results could suffer.\nCharter\u2019s services may not allow them to compete effectively. Competition may reduce its expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of Charter franchises and goodwill and its ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.\nCharter\u2019s exposure to the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect its cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter is exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of its current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of its customers and their financial ability to purchase Charter\u2019s products. If there were a general economic downturn, Charter may experience increased cancellations by its customers or to unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased. These events have adversely affected Charter in the past, and may adversely affect Charter\u2019s cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.\nIn addition, Charter is susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which it relies to provide products and services or to which it outsources certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect Charter\u2019s customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of Charter\u2019s vendors or third parties upon which it relies. Any interruption in the services provided by its vendors or by third parties could adversely affect Charter\u2019s cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.\nCharter faces risks inherent in its commercial business.\nCharter may encounter unforeseen difficulties as it increases the scale of its service offerings to businesses. Charter sells Internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and has increased its focus on growing this business. In order to grow its commercial business, Charter expects to continue to invest in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. Commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. If Charter\u2019s efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of its commercial services business would be limited. Charter depends on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of its commercial business. As a result, its ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. If Charter is unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, its commercial business could be adversely affected. Finally, Charter expects advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. Consequently, Charter is unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on its voice and commercial businesses and operations.\nProgramming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and Charter may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to its customers, its increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect its cash flow and operating margins.\nProgramming has been, and is expected to continue to be, Charter\u2019s largest operating expense item. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. Charter expects programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, additional programming, including new sports services, out-of-home or non-linear programming and attempts by programmers to replace advertising revenue they are losing to online marketing options and as a result of declining viewership ratings. The inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to its customers has had an adverse impact on Charter\u2019s cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. Charter has programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2016. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that Charter is unable to\nI-31\nreach agreement with certain programmers on terms that it believes are reasonable, Charter may be forced to remove such programming channels from its line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers.\nIncreased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase Charter\u2019s programming costs. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between \u201cmust-carry\u201d rights and an alternative \u201cretransmission-consent\u201d regime. When a station opts for the latter, cable operators are not allowed to carry the station\u2019s signal without the station\u2019s permission. In some cases, Charter carries stations under short-term arrangements while it attempts to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. If negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require Charter to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations could make its video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. In retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase Charter\u2019s programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity it has available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on its business and financial results.\nCharter\u2019s inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could limit its ability to compete effectively.\nCharter\u2019s business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, some of which are bandwidth-intensive. Charter may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. The implementation of its network-based user interface, Spectrum Guide\u00ae, and downloadable security necessary for Charter\u2019s Worldbox set-top box strategy, may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. In order to realize the benefits of its Worldbox technology, Charter must implement its downloadable conditional access security in its regional video networks. Charter\u2019s inability to maintain and expand its upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nCharter depends on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if it is unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, its ability to offer services could be impaired, and Charter\u2019s growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCharter depends on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of its services. Charter obtains these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services it desires. Some of Charter\u2019s hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent its sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services it needs in a timely manner, at its specifications and at reasonable prices, Charter\u2019s ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay its ability to serve its customers. These events could materially and adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on its operations, business, financial results and financial condition. A limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. Charter\u2019s cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which it believes has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. As an alternative, Charter has developed a conditional access security system which may be downloaded into set-top boxes with specified features that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. Charter refers to its specified set top box as its Worldbox. In order to realize the benefits of its Worldbox technology, Charter must implement a conditional access security system across its video network. Charter cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.\nCharter further depends on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses to establish and maintain its intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in its operating activities. Any of its intellectual\nI-32\nproperty rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit Charter to continue to use certain intellectual property, which could result in discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm, it incurring substantial monetary liability or being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question.\nVarious events could disrupt Charter\u2019s networks, information systems or properties and could impair its operating activities and negatively impact its reputation.\nNetwork and information systems technologies are critical to Charter\u2019s operating activities, as well as its customers\u2019 access to its services. Charter may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. Malicious and abusive activities, such as the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, computer hackings, social engineering, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activities have become more common in industry overall. If directed at Charter or technologies upon which it depends, these activities could have adverse consequences on its network and its customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to its or its customers\u2019 equipment and data. Further, these activities could result in security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in Charter\u2019s information technology systems and networks, and in its vendors\u2019 systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data. System failures and network disruptions may also be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions or telecommunications failures. If a significant incident were to occur, it could damage Charter\u2019s reputation and credibility, lead to customer dissatisfaction and, ultimately, loss of customers or revenue, in addition to increased costs to service its customers and protect its network. These events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and Charter\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect Charter\u2019s growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor tax purposes, Charter could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit its ability to use its tax loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Charter had approximately $11.3 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $4.0 billion. Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2035. These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $365 million. State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2016 through 2035. Due to uncertainties in projected future taxable income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets for book accounting purposes, except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized. Such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset its future taxable income.\nIn the past, Charter has experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d at any time over the preceding three years. As a result, Charter, and following the Time Warner Cable Merger, New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its loss carryforwards which existed at November 30, 2009 for the first \"ownership change\" and those that existed at May 1, 2013 for the second \"ownership change.\" The limitation on Charter\u2019s ability to use its loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce its ability to use a portion of its loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in Charter being required to make material cash tax payments. Charter\u2019s ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on its liquidity or its ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.\nIf Charter were to experience a third ownership change in the future (as a result of the transactions with Time Warner Cable, Bright House and Liberty Broadband or from purchases and sales of stock by its \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d new issuances or redemptions of its stock, certain acquisitions of its stock and issuances, redemptions, sales or other dispositions or acquisitions\nI-33\nof interests in its \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d), Charter\u2019s ability to use its loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations. Charter\u2019s common stock is subject to certain transfer restrictions contained in its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. These restrictions, which are designed to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring and thereby preserve its ability to utilize its loss carryforwards, are not currently operative but could become operative in the future if certain events occur and the restrictions are imposed by Charter\u2019s board of directors. However, there can be no assurance that its board of directors would choose to impose these restrictions or that such restrictions, if imposed, would prevent an ownership change from occurring. These restrictions will be eliminated if the Bright House transaction is consummated.\nIf Charter is unable to retain key employees, its ability to manage its business could be adversely affected.\nCharter\u2019s operational results have depended, and its future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of its management team. Charter\u2019s ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect Charter\u2019s ability to manage its business and its future operational and financial results.\nCharter\u2019s inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm its operating results.\nCharter continuously evaluates and pursues large and small acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that it believes could complement or expand its business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, including in the near term, Charter may enter into letters of intent with companies with which it is negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which it is conducting due diligence. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of Charter\u2019s available cash or require it to seek additional equity or debt financing. Charter may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into its existing business and operations. Charter\u2019s due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions Charter completes, it may not achieve the growth, synergies or other benefits it expected to achieve, and Charter may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect its operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm its business. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nCharter\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect its business.\nRegulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators\u2019 operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenue. Cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:\n\u00b7\nthe provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;\n\u00b7\nsubscriber and employee privacy and data security;\n\u00b7\nlimited rate regulation of video service;\n\u00b7\ncopyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;\n\u00b7\nwhen a cable system must carry a broadcast station or obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control inside wiring;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of high-speed Internet service, including net neutrality rules;\nI-34\n\u00b7\nclassification as a Title II carrier;\n\u00b7\nthe provision of voice communications;\n\u00b7\ncable franchise renewals and transfers;\n\u00b7\nequal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and\n\u00b7\napproval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.\nAdditionally, many aspects of these laws and regulations are often the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. There are also ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over Charter\u2019s cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks it already faces, and proposals that might make it easier for its employees to unionize. Some states are considering adopting energy efficiency regulations governing the operation of equipment (such as broadband modems) that Charter uses to deliver Internet services, which could constrain innovation in broadband services and equipment. Congress is considering whether to rewrite the entire Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to account for changes in the communications marketplace. Congress and various federal agencies are also considering more focused changes, such as new privacy restrictions and new restrictions on the use of personal and profiling information for behavioral advertising. In response to recent global data breaches, malicious activity and cyber threats, as well as the general increasing concerns regarding the protection of consumers\u2019 personal information, Congress and various federal agencies are also considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Charter\u2019s business. These new laws, as well as existing legal and regulatory obligations, could affect Charter\u2019s operations and require significant expenditures. In addition, federal, state, and local regulators could deny necessary approval of the TWC Merger and the Bright House Transaction or impose additional regulatory conditions in connection with their review of these transactions that could affect its operations.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect its business.\nCharter\u2019s cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and Charter has operated and is operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.\nThe traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Some state franchising laws do not allow Charter to immediately opt into favorable statewide franchising as quickly as new entrants, and often require Charter to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrants.\nThere can be no assurance that Charter will be able to comply with all significant provisions of its franchise agreements and certain of its franchisers have from time to time alleged that Charter has not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically Charter has renewed its franchises without incurring significant costs, there can be no assurance that Charter will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, its franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect Charter\u2019s business in the affected geographic area.\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for Charter\u2019s products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.\nI-35\nCharter\u2019s cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with Charter on more favorable terms. As a result, competing operators may build systems in areas in which Charter holds franchises.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators. Broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchise obligations applicable to Charter\u2019s traditional cable systems.\nThe FCC administers a program that collects Universal Service Fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low- income consumers and the provision of Internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers in the future. Although the FCC decided in the net neutrality proceeding not to require such contributions at this time, a variety of regulatory changes may lead the FCC to expand the collection of Universal Service Fund contributions to encompass Internet service providers. The FCC has begun to redirect some of this funding to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors in competing with Charter\u2019s services.\nLocal franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on Charter\u2019s business, which could further increase its expenses.\nIn addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating Charter\u2019s business. Local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to Charter\u2019s tax positions could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nCharter operates cable systems in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, is subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect Charter\u2019s tax positions. There can be no assurance that its effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. Certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. However, on February 11, 2016, the Senate approved and sent to the President legislation that permanently extends the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibits many taxes on Internet access service. Potential changes include additional taxes or fees on Charter\u2019s services which could impact its customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase Charter\u2019s income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that Charter\u2019s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that it would be successful in any such challenge.\nFurther regulation of the cable industry could impair Charter\u2019s ability to raise rates to cover its increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.\nCurrently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities. However, the FCC and Congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. It is possible that either the FCC or Congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for Charter\u2019s video services or even for its high-speed Internet and voice services. Should this occur, it would impede Charter\u2019s ability to raise its rates. If Charter is unable to raise its rates in response to increasing costs, its losses would increase.\nI-36\nThere has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an \u00e0-la-carte basis to consumers. While any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a stand-alone basis could be beneficial to Charter, any such new regulation or legislation that limits how Charter sells programming could adversely affect its business.\nActions by pole owners might subject Charter to significantly increased pole attachment costs.\nPole attachments are cable wires that are attached to utility poles. Cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. In contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation. In 2011, the FCC amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The order overall strengthens the cable industry\u2019s ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms and conditions. It also allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments that could result in additional costs for cable operators. The new rules were affirmed in 2013. On November 17, 2015, the FCC adopted an order on reconsideration that revises the pole attachment regulations to prevent cable operators such as Charter that provide telecommunications services from paying higher pole attachment rates than the cable rates under FCC rules. Future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates Charter pays utility companies.\nIncreasing regulation of Charter\u2019s Internet service product could adversely affect its ability to provide new products and services.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted open Internet rules that reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services and regulate broadband services offered by Internet service providers (ISPs) under Title II, Title III and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. The regulations prohibit ISPs from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing, or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic in exchange for consideration. The rules also allow the FCC to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection agreements of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage consumers or edge providers. The rules also require greater transparency by ISPs, including increased disclosure of promotional rates, fees and surcharges. The FCC forbears, or refrains from, imposing certain Title II regulation on ISPs, such as state regulation, tariffs, and last-mile unbundling, and does not assess Universal Service Fund fees on broadband at this time. Multiple parties have challenged the open Internet rules in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d). The D.C. Circuit is expected to rule on the challenge in 2016. We do not know at the current time if the new regulations adopted by the FCC actually will go into effect or be struck down by a legal appeal, or how the new rules actually would be administered by the FCC, but such rules could limit Charter\u2019s ability to efficiently manage its cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges.\nChanges in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on Charter.\nCable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. Charter can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that it might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). The FCC adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate Charter can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase its administrative burdens, but these remained stayed while under appeal. Legislation has been introduced in Congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact Charter\u2019s carriage of broadcast signals by simultaneously eliminating the cable industry\u2019s compulsory copyright license and the retransmission consent requirements governing cable\u2019s retransmission of broadcast signals. The FCC also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers and multichannel video distributors. Future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with Charter\u2019s preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase its programming costs, and limit its ability to offer services that would maximize its revenue potential. It is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting Charter\u2019s discretion over programming decisions.\nI-37\nCharter\u2019s voice service is subject to additional regulatory burdens which may increase, causing it to incur additional costs.\nCharter offers voice communications services over its broadband network using voice over Internet protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those Charter offers its customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that Charter\u2019s VoIP services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights is being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect Charter\u2019s ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear. Telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP providers. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to Charter\u2019s VoIP service, it could cause Charter to incur additional costs. The FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many VoIP providers such as Charter, including E-9-1-1, Universal Service Fund collection, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (\u201cCALEA\u201d) obligations, privacy of Customer Proprietary Network Information, number porting, rural call completion reporting, disability access and discontinuance of service requirements. In November 2011, the FCC released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers, including VoIP service providers like Charter. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rules in May 2014. The new rules will result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period.\nFactors Relating to the TWC Merger and the Bright House Transaction\nIn order to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, Charter along with Time Warner Cable and Bright House must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions to the parties, completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction could be reduced.\nThe completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction are each conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the required governmental authorizations, including an order of the FCC with respect to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although Charter and Time Warner Cable have agreed in the Merger Agreement, and Charter and Bright House have agreed in the Contribution Agreement, to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to obtain the required governmental authorizations, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or that the relevant authorizations will be obtained. In addition, the governmental authorities with or from which these authorizations are required generally have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to authorization of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, these governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business after completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. Under the terms of each of the Merger Agreement and Contribution Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, Charter and its subsidiaries are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by governmental authorities and accept any other remedies to the extent such actions, conditions or other remedies would not constitute a burdensome condition. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) following the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, or otherwise adversely affecting the business and results of operations of New Charter or Charter, as applicable, after completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. In addition, there can be no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nNew Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) may not realize anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities.\nNew Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) expects to realize cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House\nI-38\nTransaction. The combined company\u2019s success in realizing these cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations obtained in the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction. Even if New Charter or Charter, as applicable, is able to integrate the business operations obtained in the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction successfully, it is not possible to predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals for the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, or increased operating costs that may be experienced as a result of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. Realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond New Charter\u2019s or Charter\u2019s control, as applicable, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and vendors and regulatory developments.\nIf New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) is not able to successfully integrate Charter\u2019s business with that of Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or Bright House Transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such circumstances, in the event the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if applicable, the Bright House Transaction) are completed, New Charter may not perform as expected and the value of the New Charter Class A common stock (including the merger consideration) may be adversely affected.\nCharter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House have operated and, until completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or Bright House Transaction, will continue to operate independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. After consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction the combined company will have significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than each company did prior to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Charter, Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House employees, the loss of subscribers and customers, the disruption of the companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The process of integrating Time Warner Cable, Bright House, or Time Warner Cable and Bright House, with the businesses Charter operated prior to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction will require significant capital expenditures and the expansion of certain operations and operating and financial systems. Management of each company will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process before the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is completed. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. These difficulties include:\n\u00b7\nintegrating the companies\u2019 operations and corporate functions;\n\u00b7\nintegrating the companies\u2019 technologies, networks and customer service platforms;\n\u00b7\nintegrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers;\n\u00b7\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining existing relationships and agreements with customers, providers, programmers and other vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;\n\u00b7\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u00b7\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating programming and marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u00b7\nintegrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u00b7\nintegrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;\nI-39\n\u00b7\ncompleting the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the systems to be acquired from Time Warner Cable and Bright House;\n\u00b7\nmanaging a significantly larger company than before the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction; and\n\u00b7\nattracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets.\nEven if the new businesses are successfully integrated, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or Bright House Transaction may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses and increased operating costs. If the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefits from the transactions, its liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price may be adversely affected. In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of Charter\u2019s, Time Warner Cable\u2019s and/or Bright House\u2019s management and resources may be focused on the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction and the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company\u2019s business and the business of the combined company.\nThe substantial indebtedness that will be incurred by New Charter in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if applicable, the Bright House Transaction) could adversely affect New Charter\u2019s operations and financial condition after the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Charter\u2019s total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion, including $21.8 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger. New Charter\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness could have negative consequences to New Charter after the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction), such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring New Charter to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operating activities to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting New Charter\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nexposing New Charter to increased interest expense to the extent New Charter refinances existing debt with higher cost debt;\n\u00b7\nto the extent that New Charter\u2019s debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing New Charter\u2019s vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates;\n\u00b7\nplacing New Charter at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting New Charter\u2019s relationship with customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nlimiting New Charter\u2019s flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting New Charter\u2019s ability to buy back New Charter Class A common stock or pay cash dividends.\nIf current debt amounts increase, the related risks that Charter now faces may intensify.\nBecause of high debt levels, New Charter may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms after the Time Warner Cable Merger (and/or the Bright House Transaction).\nNew Charter\u2019s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements governing New Charter\u2019s indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in customer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. Should New Charter\u2019s revenues decline after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, it may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. If New Charter is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or should it fail to comply\nI-40\nwith its financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing New Charter\u2019s indebtedness, New Charter may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or borrow more money. New Charter may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to New Charter or at all. The inability of New Charter to refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on New Charter\u2019s financial condition and results from operations after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nNew Charter will be dependent on an equity financing from Liberty Broadband to partially finance the Time Warner Cable Merger.\nCharter plans to use the proceeds of $4.3 billion from the purchase by Liberty Broadband of New Charter Class A common stock to partially fund the Time Warner Cable Merger. Liberty Broadband will primarily rely on proceeds from third-party investors to fund the investment in New Charter Class A common stock, and Liberty Broadband has secured commitments for such financing through investment agreements with such third parties. Liberty Broadband cannot guarantee that it will successfully complete these transactions with such third-party investors. The Time Warner Cable Merger is not conditioned on the receipt of financing, including financing from Liberty Broadband.\nCharter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction on Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House employees may impair Charter\u2019s, Time Warner Cable\u2019s and Bright House\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel prior to and following the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. In addition, certain employees potentially could terminate their employment for good reason and collect severance if certain specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements occur following the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, including certain changes in such employees\u2019 duties, position, compensation and benefits or primary office location. If employees of Charter, Time Warner Cable or Bright House depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined company\u2019s business following the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction may be harmed. Furthermore, New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Charter, Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House, and the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with activities of labor unions or integrating employees into New Charter.\nA delay in the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction may diminish the anticipated benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nCompletion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental consents and approvals, orders, authorizations, and rulings, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the adoption of an order, by the FCC and any other requisite governmental entity granting its consent to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. The requirement to receive these consents and approvals, orders, authorizations and rulings before the Time Warner Cable Merger could delay the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction if, for example, government agencies request additional information from the parties in order to facilitate their review of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or require any conditions precedent to granting their approval of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. In addition, these governmental agencies may attempt to condition their approval of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction on the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, including but not limited to its operating results or the value of New Charter Class A common stock (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter Class A common stock). Any delay in the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or result in additional transaction costs, including interest expense for debt incurred in anticipation of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. Any\nI-41\nuncertainty over the ability of the companies to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction could make it more difficult for Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House to retain key employees or to pursue business strategies.\nPrior to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, Charter, Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House, as applicable, and after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, the combined company, will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nPrior to the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, Charter, Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House, as applicable, and after the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, the combined company, expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction before, at, and after closing the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Charter will be required to pay to Time Warner Cable certain termination fees. Charter and/or New Charter also will incur transaction fees and costs related to financing (including interest and fees with any pre-funding of the consideration to be paid in the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction) and formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems implementation costs and employment-related costs. Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is completed, including a portion of the fees and expenses of financial advisors and other advisors and representatives and filing fees for the proxy statement. While many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time, management of Charter continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and integration. There are a number of factors beyond the control of the parties that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Although the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. These integration expenses may result in Charter and/or New Charter taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction. In addition, if the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is not consummated, Charter will bear some or all of these costs without the benefit of efficiencies from the integration of the businesses. Such costs could have a material adverse impact on Charter and/or New Charter\u2019s financial results.\nSales of New Charter Class A common stock after the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction) may negatively affect the market price of New Charter Class A common stock.\nThe shares of New Charter Class A common stock to be issued in the Time Warner Cable Merger to holders of Time Warner Cable common stock will generally be eligible for immediate resale. The market price of New Charter Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of New Charter Class A common stock in the market after the consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction) or even the perception that these sales could occur.\nI-42\nCharter\u2019s, Time Warner Cable\u2019s and Bright House\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nParties with which Charter, Time Warner Cable or Bright House do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Charter, Time Warner Cable, Bright House or the combined business. Charter\u2019s, Time Warner Cable\u2019s and Bright House\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties excluding Charter, Time Warner Cable, Bright House or the combined business. These disruptions, which may exist for an extended period of time if completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction) is delayed, could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including an adverse effect on New Charter\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction). The risk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or termination of the merger agreement and/or the Bright House contribution agreement.\nFailure to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Charter.\nIf the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of Charter may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction, Charter would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nCharter may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u00b7\nCharter may experience negative reactions from its customers, regulators and employees;\n\u00b7\nCharter will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Time Warner Cable Merger, whether or not the Time Warner Cable Merger is completed and Charter will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Bright House Transaction, whether or not the Bright House Transaction is completed;\n\u00b7\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Time Warner Cable\u2019s and Charter\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger; such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent Time Warner Cable and Charter from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Time Warner Cable Merger;\n\u00b7\nthe Contribution Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Charter\u2019s business prior to completion of the Bright House Transaction; such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of A/N (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent Charter from taking certain specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Bright House Transaction; and\n\u00b7\nmatters relating to the Time Warner Cable Merger (and with respect to Charter only, matters relating to the Bright House contribution), including integration planning, will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Charter and Time Warner Cable management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either Charter or Time Warner Cable as an independent company.\nIf the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is not completed, the risks described above may materialize, and they may adversely affect Charter\u2019s business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nIn addition, Charter and Time Warner Cable could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Charter or Time Warner Cable to perform their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement or against Charter to perform it obligations under the Contribution Agreement.\nIf the operating results of Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House before or following the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction is less than Charter\u2019s and/or New Charter\u2019s expectations, or an increase in the capital\nI-43\nexpenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments are greater than expected, New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction.\nNew Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) will derive a portion of its revenues and earnings per share from the operation of Time Warner Cable and/or Bright House following completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or Bright House Transaction. Therefore, any negative impact on these companies or the operating results derived from such companies could harm the combined company\u2019s operating results.\nThe businesses of Charter, Time Warner Cable, Bright House and New Charter are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. New Charter (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter) intends to make investments in the combined business following the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or the Bright House Transaction and transition toward only using two-way all-digital set-top boxes. The increase in capital expenditures necessary for the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the business may negatively impact the expected financial results from the Time Warner Cable Merger and/or Bright House Transaction. The combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. New Charter\u2019s (or, if only the Bright House Transaction is completed, Charter\u2019s) inability to maintain, expand and upgrade its existing or combined businesses could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition by New Charter in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Time Warner Cable and Bright House will be recorded, as of the date of completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Bright House Transaction and Liberty Broadband transactions, at their respective fair values and added to those of Charter. The reported financial condition and results of operations of New Charter issued after completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Bright House Transaction and Liberty Broadband transactions will reflect New Charter balances and results after completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Bright House Transaction and Liberty Broadband transactions, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of New Charter for periods prior to the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Bright House Transaction and Liberty Broadband transactions. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to Time Warner Cable\u2019s and Bright House\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Bright House Transaction and Liberty Broadband transactions.\nThe excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House expect that the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction will result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, New Charter may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on New Charter\u2019s operating results.\nCompletion of the Time Warner Cable Merger is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Time Warner Cable Merger will not be completed.\nThe obligations of Charter and Time Warner Cable to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nexpiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (solely with respect to the obligations of each of Charter, New Charter and the merger subsidiaries to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger, without the imposition of any burdensome condition);\n\u00b7\n(i) adoption of an order, and release of the full text thereof, by the FCC granting its consent to the transfer of control or assignment of the licenses issued by the FCC to Time Warner Cable or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) approval of certain local franchise authorities (\u201cLFAs\u201d), such that the sum of the aggregate number of video subscribers of Time Warner Cable belonging to franchise areas for which either (x) no LFA consent is required or (y) if LFA consent is required, such consent shall have been obtained, shall be no less than 85% of the aggregate number of video subscribers of Time Warner Cable and (iii) authorizations of state public utilities commissions\nI-44\nwhose consent is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (solely with respect to the obligations of each of Charter, New Charter and the merger subsidiaries to complete the Time Warner Cable Merger, in each case without the imposition of any burdensome condition);\n\u00b7\nexcept for the conditions described in the two preceding bullets, (i) absence of (x) any applicable law of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction enacted or promulgated after the date of the merger agreement in a jurisdiction in which any of Charter, Time Warner Cable or their respective subsidiaries has substantial operations and (y) any order of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that, in each case, (1) imposes any burdensome condition or (2) prohibits completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and the violation of which would result in criminal liability, and (ii) the absence of any injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that imposes a burdensome condition or prohibits completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger;\n\u00b7\napproval for the listing on NASDAQ of the shares of New Charter Class A common stock to be issued in the Time Warner Cable Merger, subject only to official notice of issuance;\n\u00b7\naccuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality thresholds;\n\u00b7\nperformance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger;\n\u00b7\nthe absence of a material adverse effect on the other party;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of a certificate executed by an executive officer of the other party as to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the preceding three bullets with respect to such other party; and\n\u00b7\ndelivery of opinions of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, in the case of Charter, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, in the case of Time Warner Cable, with respect to certain tax aspects of the Time Warner Cable Merger.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Time Warner Cable Merger will be completed. There can be no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the Time Warner Cable Merger. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the companies\u2019 results of operations and the trading price of the Time Warner Cable common stock or Charter Class A common stock.\nThe Time Warner Cable Merger is not conditioned upon completion of the Bright House Transaction or the issuance of shares to A/N. The Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction are subject to separate conditions, and the Time Warner Cable Merger may be completed whether or not the Bright House Transaction is ultimately consummated.\nThe market price of New Charter Class A common stock after the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction) may be affected by factors different from those affecting shares of Charter or Time Warner Cable common stock currently.\nUpon completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, holders of Charter Class A common stock will become holders of shares of New Charter Class A common stock. The businesses of Charter differ from those of Time Warner Cable in important respects, including the following:\n\u00b7\nDifferences in product penetration and mix, including different approaches to pricing and packaging;\n\u00b7\nDifferences in the geographic operating areas served by Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House as well as different presences in those areas, different structures and different competitive factors in those areas;\n\u00b7\nDifferences in the technology platforms and physical plant and property used to deliver the companies\u2019 respective products and services, including that Charter\u2019s platform has generally been converted to all digital;\n\u00b7\nDifferences in the companies\u2019 corporate and organizational structure;\n\u00b7\nTime Warner Cable engages in telecom and Internet infrastructure businesses, including through its subsidiary DukeNet Communications;\nI-45\n\u00b7\nTime Warner Cable engages in information technology (\"IT\") and cloud businesses, including through its NaviSite subsidiary, outsourced IT solutions and cloud services;\n\u00b7\nTime Warner Cable operates and distributes regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels; and\n\u00b7\nDifferences in the potential tax treatment of historical transactions of both Charter and Time Warner Cable.\nAccordingly, the results of operations, including capital expenditures, of New Charter after the Time Warner Cable Merger (and, if completed, the Bright House Transaction), as well as the market price of New Charter Class A common stock, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of operations, including capital expenditures, of Charter and Time Warner Cable currently.\nThe shares of New Charter Class A common stock to be received by Time Warner Cable and Charter stockholders as a result of the Time Warner Cable Merger will have different rights from shares of Time Warner Cable common stock and Charter Class A common stock previously held by such stockholders.\nFollowing completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger, Time Warner Cable and Charter stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Time Warner Cable and Charter, respectively, but will instead be stockholders of New Charter. There are important differences between the rights of Time Warner Cable and Charter stockholders and the rights of New Charter stockholders.\nLitigation has been filed against Charter, Charter\u2019s board of directors, Time Warner Cable, the Time Warner Cable board of directors and the merger subsidiaries. An adverse ruling in such lawsuit may result in the payment of damages following completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger.\nLitigation has been filed against Charter, Time Warner Cable, the Time Warner Cable board of directors and the merger subsidiaries in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, which could result in substantial costs to Charter, Time Warner Cable, and/or New Charter. See \u201cItem 3. - Legal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nCompletion of the Bright House Transaction is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Bright House Transaction will not be completed.\nThe obligation of Charter and New Charter and the obligation of A/N to complete the Bright House Transaction are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger, except in certain circumstances;\n\u00b7\nexpiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period and receipt of certain regulatory approvals for the Bright House Transaction (and with respect to Charter\u2019s obligations, without the imposition of a Bright House contribution burdensome condition);\n\u00b7\nobtaining all of the required consents by the FCC to the transfer to Charter of all FCC licenses, authorizations, permits and consents held by Bright House or its subsidiaries and/or used in the Bright House business (solely with respect to Charter, New Charter and Charter Holdings, without the imposition of a Bright House contribution burdensome);\n\u00b7\nthe aggregate number of video customers served by the Bright House systems used in the Bright House business (i) pursuant to the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d provisions of the Communications Act and (ii) pursuant to franchises for which (A) no consent is required from any government entity for the completion of the Bright House contribution or (B) any such consent is required and has been received (or deemed received under Section 617 of the Communications Act) (solely with respect to the obligations of Charter, New Charter and Charter Holdings, without the imposition of a Bright House contribution burdensome condition) shall not be less than 80% of the video customers served by the Bright House systems used in the Bright House business at the closing; and if less than 100% of such number of video customers, all applicable waiting periods (including extensions) shall have expired with respect to the FCC Forms 394 filed in connection with requests for approvals by local franchising authorities that have not been obtained;\nI-46\n\u00b7\nobtaining authorizations from state communications authorities as required for Charter to provide voice and other regulated services in the Bright House systems used in the Bright House business following the closing (solely with respect to the obligations of Charter, New Charter and Charter Holdings, without the imposition of a Bright House contribution burdensome condition);\n\u00b7\nthe absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) in effect that makes unlawful, prohibits, delays, enjoins or otherwise prevents or restricts, the consummation of the Bright House Transaction or any pending action that seeks any of the foregoing;\n\u00b7\nthe Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement being valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect;\n\u00b7\nwith respect to the obligations of Charter, New Charter and Charter Holdings, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Bright House;\n\u00b7\nwith respect to A/N\u2019s obligations, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Charter; and\n\u00b7\ncertain other customary conditions with respect to the accuracy of representations and warranties, performance of covenants and agreements, receipt of certifications with respect to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and delivery of certain other specified certificates, instruments of assignment and transaction documents.\nAs more fully described in the Contribution Agreement, the obligation of Charter, New Charter and Charter Holdings to complete the Bright House Transaction is also subject to the completion by A/N of a restructuring, pursuant to which Bright House will transfer to A/N certain excluded assets and A/N shall assume from Bright House certain excluded liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Bright House Transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the Bright House Transaction will be completed. The consummation of the Bright House Transaction is conditioned on the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger. However, if the Time Warner Cable Merger is not completed, Charter and A/N may still be obligated to complete the Bright House Transaction under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the Bright House Transaction will be completed if the Time Warner Cable Merger is not completed.\nFactors Relating to TruePosition\nTruePosition and its subsidiary Skyhook face competition from multiple sources.\nTruePosition faces competition from a number of suppliers of both WiFi based technology solutions and other wireless location technologies, such as GPS, Observed Time Difference of Arrival \u201cOTDOA\u201d and Terrestrial Beacons, which provide similar location-based products and services to TruePosition. Skyhook faces competition from Google, Inc. \u201cGoogle\u201d, HERE and smaller regional or niche market competitors, as providers of location-based services and products. Certain of these competitors are substantially larger than TruePosition or Skyhook, as applicable, and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Thus, many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in its markets, and often have broader product lines and market focus, have greater brand recognition and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer, may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than TruePosition or Skyhook is able to provide. If large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with TruePosition or Skyhook choose to enter its markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify. In addition, the growth of new location technologies currently in development may further increase competition to provide these new technologies. If TruePosition and Skyhook are not able to compete successfully for customers, the financial position of TruePosition may be materially adversely affected.\nThe revenue of TruePosition and Skyhook each depend on a limited number of customers, and the loss of their more significant customers could adversely affect the business of TruePosition.\nTruePosition and its operating subsidiary Skyhook derive a significant amount of their respective revenue from a limited number of customers, and it is anticipated that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of the revenue of TruePosition and Skyhook individually and in the aggregate. Because they depend on a limited number of customers, the loss of\nI-47\nany one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of TruePosition. Certain of these customers may fail to renew their contracts with TruePosition or Skyhook from time to time, creating additional risk with respect to the potential loss of revenue from these customers. For example, TruePosition has been largely dependent since 2012 on one wireless carrier, which accounted for approximately 80% - 90% of TruePosition\u2019s overall revenue, and this customer did not renew this contract when it expired on December 31, 2015. The loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of these existing customers of True Position or Skyhook would materially adversely affect revenue, financial condition and results of operations of TruePosition.\nThe revenue of TruePosition and Skyhook each depend on the commercial deployment of wireless and other communications technologies and their ability to continue to drive customer demand for their products and services in a rapidly evolving and developing industry.\nTruePosition and Skyhook each develop, patent and commercialize products and services based on wireless and other communications technologies. They depend on their customers, licensees, operators of these wireless technologies and networks and other industries to use and timely deploy their products and services. TruePosition and Skyhook also depend on their customers and licensees to develop products and services with value-added features to drive sales as well as consumer demand for new wireless devices. As a result, TruePosition and Skyhook must stay abreast of rapidly evolving technological developments and offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of their products and services, and they must be able to incorporate new technologies into their products and services in order to address the needs of their customers. The failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and services on a timely and cost-competitive basis that comply with evolving industry standards and regulations or the inability to continue to market existing products on a cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on TruePosition\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in order to successfully develop and market certain of TruePosition\u2019s or Skyhook\u2019s products and services, TruePosition or Skyhook may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties. TruePosition and Skyhook cannot provide assurances that they will be able to timely enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreements on reasonable terms, or at all.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which TruePosition or Skyhook\u2019s customers operate may negatively impact their business.\nIn the U.S., the FCC regulates wireless carriers, wireless services and E- 9-1-1 requirements. FCC regulatory actions affecting wireless carriers and services and E-9-1-1 requirements may adversely affect TruePosition\u2019s wireless phone and device location technology and the positioning services offered by Skyhook. The E-9-1-1 location accuracy requirements originally adopted by the FCC in 1996 applied only to 911 calls originating outdoors. However, because of the increased use of wireless phones indoors, on January 29, 2015, the FCC adopted indoor location accuracy rules its Fourth Report and Order in its E-9-1-1 location accuracy proceeding. Under the new rules, all wireless providers generally must provide horizontal location information for 40% of all wireless 911 calls within 2 years of the effective date of the Fourth Report and Order (April 30, 2015), 50% within 3 years, 70% within 5 years and 80 % within 6 years of the effective date. Wireless providers also must meet specific requirements for the provision of vertical location information for wireless 911 calls within three-to-eight years of the effective date. Smaller wireless providers may have additional time to comply with certain of the horizontal and vertical benchmarks.\nA distinguishing characteristic of TruePosition\u2019s technologies is their ability to locate wireless devices indoors, where GPS signals may be compromised or blocked. As the rules currently stand, they may offer opportunity to TruePosition\u2019s technologies. However, even if TruePosition is able to produce and provide products and services compliant with these regulations, much uncertainty exists as to whether TruePosition will be able to successfully compete for carrier contracts.\nTruePosition will be actively competing for carrier contracts required to comply with the regulations. Even if TruePosition is able to produce and provide products and services compliant with these regulations, until information regarding any compliant products and services offered by TruePosition\u2019s competitors becomes available, much uncertainty exists as to whether TruePosition will be able to successfully compete for carrier contracts.\nOther U.S. regulatory agencies also may seek to regulate aspects of the services provided by TruePosition and Skyhook. Further, to the extent TruePosition and Skyhook operate abroad, both businesses are subject to potential action by foreign\nI-48\nregulatory agencies. TruePosition cannot anticipate how such additional regulation by the FCC, another U.S. Government agency, or any foreign regulator will affect its businesses.\nThe success of TruePosition and Skyhook depends on the integrity of their systems and infrastructures.\nTruePosition and Skyhook rely on their enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing, purchasing and supply chain management, human resources and financial reporting. Portions of TruePosition\u2019s or Skyhook\u2019s IT infrastructure may experience interruptions of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures, systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. TruePosition and Skyhook may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. If TruePosition and Skyhook are unable to successfully implement major systems initiatives and maintain critical information systems, they could encounter difficulties that could have a material adverse impact on TruePosition\u2019s business.\nFurthermore, the businesses of TruePosition and Skyhook depend on delivering products and services to customers of consistently high quality and reliability. If the services offered by TruePosition or Skyhook were to fail or not to perform as expected, their services could be rendered ineffective, and any significant or systemic service failure could also result in a loss of customer confidence, as well as reputational damage, resulting in a material adverse impact on TruePosition\u2019s business.\nPrivacy concerns relating to the technology of TruePosition and Skyhook could damage their reputations and deter current and potential users from using their products and applications.\nConcerns about the practices of TruePosition and Skyhook with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage their reputations and operating results. While TruePosition and Skyhook strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as their own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against TruePosition or Skyhook by government entities or others, or could cause them to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on TruePosition\u2019s business.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the data practices of TruePosition and Skyhook. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring changes in the data practices of TruePosition and Skyhook, which could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of TruePosition. Complying with these various laws could result in the incurrence of substantial costs or require changes to business practices in a manner adverse to the business of TruePosition and Skyhook.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise the information collected and stored by TruePosition and Skyhook and expose them to liability, which would cause business and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of their respective businesses, each of TruePosition and Skyhook collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, their proprietary business information and that of their customers and suppliers, and potentially personally identifiable information of their users and employees, in their facilities and on their networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to their operations. Despite security measures in place at TruePosition and Skyhook, their information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise their networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disruption of operations, reputational damage, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect TruePosition\u2019s business and revenue.\nActions taken by TruePosition and Skyhook to adequately protect their respective intellectual property rights, such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce their intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs, and their ability to compete could be harmed if they fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing so.\nI-49\nTruePosition and Skyhook rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and other methods to protect their intellectual property in the United States and internationally. TruePosition and Skyhook have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and/or in foreign jurisdictions which primarily relate to products and the technology used in connection with the products and services offered by TruePosition and Skyhook. TruePosition and Skyhook cannot be certain that the steps they have taken, or may take in the future, will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of their proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where international treaties, organizations and foreign laws may not protect their proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Any pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved, and any issued patents may not provide TruePosition or Skyhook with competitive advantages or may be challenged, invalidated, infringed, circumvented or misappropriated by third parties. Other companies, including some of TruePosition\u2019s and Skyhook\u2019s largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in its industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit TruePosition\u2019s and Skyhook\u2019s ability to introduce new products and services unless it secures necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, as the number of issued patents increases and as competition intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may also increase. TruePosition and Skyhook may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by TruePosition or Skyhook or parties that they have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. Third parties may also claim that employees of TruePosition or Skyhook have misappropriated or divulged their former employers\u2019 trade secrets or confidential information. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.\nIn addition, TruePosition and Skyhook have been required and may be required in the future to initiate litigation in order to assert claims of infringement of their intellectual property, enforce patents issued or licensed to them, protect their trade secrets or know-how or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. TruePosition and Skyhook also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could subject TruePosition or Skyhook to significant costs or liabilities or require them to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TruePosition. Any such litigation could also result in rulings impacting the validity or enforceability of TruePosition\u2019s or Skyhook\u2019s patents, which could result in new or increased competition that could have a material adverse effect on TruePosition\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. If infringement claims are made against TruePosition or Skyhook or their products are found to infringe a third parties\u2019 patent or intellectual property, TruePosition, Skyhook or one of their indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties\u2019 patent or other intellectual property rights. However, TruePosition and Skyhook may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to them particularly from their competitors. If they or one of their indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that TruePosition or Skyhook use or that is used in one of their products, TruePosition or Skyhook could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of their products. They may also have to make royalty or other payments, cross license their technology or make payments pursuant to third party indemnitees. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for additional information about pending litigation and indemnification claims.\nIn addition, TruePosition maintains as its trade secrets certain data compilations and other information. Breach of one or more of these trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on TruePosition\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nWe expect our stock price to continue to be directly affected by the results of operation of Charter and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in Charter, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2015, which represents all of our total market value. As a result, our stock price will continue to be directly affected by the results of operations of Charter and the developments in its business.\nI-50\nAlthough our Series B common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with approximately 96% of the outstanding shares beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the board and a director of our company. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \"bid\" and \"ask\" quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"LBRDA.\"\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nrequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u00b7\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, John C. Malone currently beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 47% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership approximately 96% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2016.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not\nI-51\nhave separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14988, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "LBRDK"}
