{"cik": "95552", "company": "SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u201d and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks and uncertainties. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. Discussion about the important operational risks that our business encounters can also be found in the MD&A section and in the business description in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report. Below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently do not consider significant, could also potentially impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our reactions to these risks and uncertainties as well as our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 reactions will affect our future operating results.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and volatility in the automotive industry could adversely affect our financial performance.\nPredominantly, our sales are made to the European and U.S. automotive markets. Therefore, our financial performance depends largely on conditions in the European and U.S. automotive industry, which in turn can be affected significantly by broad economic and financial market conditions. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of consumer confidence in general economic conditions, levels of employment, prevailing wages, fuel prices and the availability and cost of consumer credit, as well as changing consumer preferences. Demand for aluminum wheels can be further affected by other factors, including pricing and performance comparisons to competitive materials such as steel. Finally, the demand for our products is influenced by shifts of market share between vehicle manufacturers and the specific market penetration of individual vehicle platforms being sold by our customers. Decreases in demand for automobiles in Europe and the United States could adversely affect the valuation of our productive assets, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our sales. The loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand could adversely affect our operating results.\nFord, GM, Toyota, VW Group and BMW, together, represented 60 percent in 2019 and 64 percent of our sales in 2018. Our OEM customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Increasingly global procurement practices, the pace of new vehicle introduction and demand for price reductions may make it more difficult to maintain long-term supply arrangements with our customers, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to negotiate supply arrangements with our customers on terms acceptable to us in the future. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers provide that we will manufacture wheels for a particular vehicle model, rather than manufacture a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model (usually three to five years), typically are non-exclusive and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of wheels from us. Therefore, a significant decrease in consumer demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or a decision by a manufacturer not to purchase from us, or to discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, including delivery, overall customer service, price, quality, technology and available capacity to meet customer demands. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We cannot ensure that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these competitors. In particular, our ability to increase manufacturing capacity typically requires significant investments in facilities, equipment and personnel. The majority of our operating facilities are at full or near to full capacity levels which may cause us to incur labor costs at premium rates in order to meet customer requirements, experience increased maintenance expenses or require us to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted new entrants, particularly from low-cost countries. Such competition with lower cost structures poses a significant threat to our ability to compete internationally and domestically. These factors have led to our customers awarding business to foreign competitors in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Consequently, our products may not be able to compete successfully with competitors\u2019 products.\nWe experience continual pressure to reduce costs.\nThe global vehicle market is highly competitive at the OEM level, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. Customer concentration, relative supplier fragmentation and product commoditization have translated into continual pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in OEMs\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business. Our OEM customers typically attempt to qualify more than one supplier for the programs we participate on and for programs we may bid on in the future. As such, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing or may decrease wheel orders from us. Such actions may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions for the Company, resulting in lower revenues, gross profit, operating income and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement cost-saving measures or achieve expected benefits under our plans to improve operations.\nAs part of our ongoing focus to provide high quality products, we continually analyze our business to further improve our operations and identify cost-cutting measures. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors. Cost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards are making it increasingly more difficult to reduce our costs. It is possible that the costs we incur to implement improvement strategies may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to successfully launch new products and/or achieve technological advances.\nIn order to compete effectively in the global automotive component supply industry, we must be able to launch new products and adopt technology to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, we cannot ensure that our customers will execute the launch of their new product programs on schedule. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. The global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. As a result, the success of our business requires us to develop and/or incorporate leading technologies. Such technologies are subject to rapid obsolescence. Our inability to maintain access to these technologies (either through development or licensing) may adversely affect our ability to compete. If we are unable to differentiate our products, maintain a low-cost footprint or compete effectively with technology-focused new market entrants, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInternational trade agreements, including the ratification of the USMCA, and our international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland and we sell our products internationally. Accordingly, unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures, trade protection laws, tariffs on aluminum, regulations and policies affecting trade and investments and social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region, among other factors, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes to existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d); (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. However, Mexico and the United States have ratified the USMCA and it is expected that Canada will ratify it in 2020. The USMCA currently includes several provisions relating to automobile manufacturing. One provision requires that automobiles must have 75 percent of their components manufactured in Mexico, the United States, or Canada to qualify for zero tariffs (up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA). Another provision requires that 40 percent to 45 percent of automobile parts must be made by workers who earn $16 per hour by 2023. Currently, our workers in Mexico make less than $16 per hour. Mexico has also agreed to pass new labor laws that are intended to make it easier for Mexican workers to unionize. We do not know whether the USMCA will be ratified by Canada or, if ratified, what the final provisions of the USMCA will contain and how those provisions will impact us but it is possible that the USMCA, if ratified, could increase our cost of manufacturing in Mexico which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in United States social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCost of manufacturing our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland may be affected by tariffs imposed by the United States, trade protection laws, policies and other regulations affecting trade and investments, social, political, labor, or general economic conditions. Other factors that can affect the business and financial results of our Mexican, German and Polish operations include, but are not limited to, changes in cost structures, currency effects of the Mexican Peso, Euro and Polish Zloty, availability and competency of personnel and tax regulations.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies and commodity and energy prices may adversely impact our financial results.\nDue to our operations outside of the United States, we experience exposure to foreign currency gains and losses in the ordinary course of our business. We settle transactions between currencies - i.e., in particular, U.S. dollar to Mexican Peso, Euro to U.S. dollar and Euro to Polish Zloty. To the extent possible, we attempt to match the timing and magnitude of transaction settlements between currencies to create a \u201cnatural hedge.\u201d Based on our current business model and levels of production and sales activity, the net imbalance between currencies depends on specific circumstances. While changes in the terms of the contracts with our customers will create an imbalance between currencies that we hedge with foreign currency forward or option contracts, there can be no assurances that our hedging program will effectively offset the impact of the imbalance between currencies or that the net transaction balance will not change significantly in the future.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to commodity and energy price risks due to significant aluminum raw material requirements and the energy intensive nature of our operations. Natural gas and electricity prices are subject a to large number of variables that are outside of our control. We use financial derivatives and fixed-price agreements with suppliers to reduce the effect of any volatility on our financial results.\nThe foreign currency forward or option contracts, the natural gas forward contracts, and the fixed-price agreements we enter into with financial institutions and suppliers are designed to protect against foreign exchange risks and price risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. We have a program to hedge a portion of our material foreign exchange or commodity and energy price exposures, typically for up to 48 months. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange or commodity or energy price exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations, the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or our inability to identify willing counterparties. There is no guarantee that our hedge program will effectively mitigate our exposures to foreign exchange and commodity and energy price changes which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the USD value of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, as well as assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies such as the Euro, and may adversely affect reported earnings and, accordingly, the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates or commodity and energy prices may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies or commodities and energy prices may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. We cannot ensure that fluctuations in exchange rates or commodities and energy prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nWe do not expect to generate sufficient cash to repay all of our indebtedness (including the Term Loan Facility and Notes) or obligations relating to the redeemable preferred stock by their respective maturity dates and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy these obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations or redeemable preferred stock depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, interest and/or dividends on our debt, redeemable preferred stock and other indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or redeemable preferred stock obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time.\nWe do not expect to generate sufficient cash to repay all principal due under the \u20ac250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due June 15, 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) of $243.1 million and the $400.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d or \u201cTerm Loan B\u201d) due May 23, 2024 of $371.8 million (together with the Revolving Credit Facility referred to as the USD Senior Secured Credit Facility, \u201cUSD SSCF\u201d), in full by the respective maturity dates, which will likely require us to refinance a portion or all of the outstanding debt. We might not be able to refinance the debt at satisfactory terms. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and associated transactions costs and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness and dividends or redemption payments on our redeemable preferred stock on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue equity, or to refinance all or portions of these obligations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service or other payment obligations, including (i) redemption of our redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the greater of $300.0 million (2.0 times stated value) or the product of the number of common shares into which the redeemable preferred stock could be converted (5.3 million shares currently) and the then current market price of our common stock and (ii) the repurchase of the Notes or redemption of the redeemable preferred stock upon a change of control or repurchase of the Notes upon sales of certain assets. The holders of the preferred stock have redemption rights that allow them to force us to redeem the preferred stock on or after September 14, 2025 to the extent allowable under Delaware Law. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit agreements governing the USD SSCF and the EUR 45.0 million credit line under the EUR Senior Secured Credit Facility (\u201cEUR SSCF\u201d), taken together the Global Senior Secured Credit Facility (\u201cGSSCF\u201d), and the Indenture for the Notes restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and/or use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due, as well as payments due with respect to our redeemable preferred stock. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nUnder the USD SSCF and EUR SSCF, we had available unused commitments of $156.4 million and 44.6 million Euros, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, which are critical to the Company\u2019s ability to pay all of its obligations in a timely manner.\nThe credit lines under the USD SSCF and EUR SSFC will mature on May 23, 2022 and May 22, 2022, respectively, which is prior to the maturities of our other outstanding debt. We might not be able to extend these credit lines beyond the current due dates or may only be able to extend them for smaller amounts. This in turn might reduce our ability to refinance our other outstanding debt or other obligations in future years. It might also cause the rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings. Additionally, it might require us to hold more cash in our bank accounts to ensure our ability to pay our obligations in a timely manner, which in turn could reduce our ability to pay down debt or other obligations.\nOur substantial indebtedness and the corresponding interest expense could adversely affect our financial condition\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt was $630.6 million ($615.0 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $15.6 million). Additionally, we had availability of $156.4 million under the USD SSCF as well as 44.6 million Euros under the EUR SSCF at December 31, 2019.\nA significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes. We cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to enter into future financings that will provide sufficient proceeds to meet or pay the interest on our debt.\nSubject to the limits contained in the credit agreements governing our GSSCF and the indenture governing our \u20ac250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due June 15, 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) (with outstanding principal balance of \u20ac217.0 million at December 31 2019) and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, the indenture covering the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the credit agreements governing the GSSCF and our other debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that among other things, could limit our ability to incur liens, engage in mergers and acquisitions, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, make investments, acquisitions, redeem our capital stock or pay dividends. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all of our debt.\nA downgrade of our credit rating or a decrease of the prices of the Company\u2019s common stock, the USD SSCF or the Notes could adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe Company, its USD SSCF, and the Notes, are rated by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. These ratings are widely followed by investors, customers, and suppliers, and a downgrade by one or both of these rating agencies might cause: suppliers to cancel our contracts, demand price increases, or decrease payment terms; customers to reduce their business activities with us; or investors to reconsider investments in financial instruments issued by Superior, all of which might cause a decrease of the price of our common stock, our Notes, and the price of the bilaterally traded Term Loan B which is a part of the USD SSCF.\nA decrease in our common stock, Notes and/or Term Loan B prices, in turn, might accelerate such negative trends. A reduction in the price of the Notes and Term Loan B implies an increase of the yield debt investors demand to provide us with financing, which, in turn, would make it more difficult for us to refinance our existing debt, redeemable preferred stock obligations and/or future debt or redeemable preferred stock obligations.\nThe terms of the credit agreement governing the GSSCF, the Indenture, and other debt instruments, as well as the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future, may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Indenture, the credit agreements governing the GSSCF and our other debt instruments, and the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future, may contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, acquisitions, loans or advances or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements which limit the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing the GSSCF and other debt instruments require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests to the extent subject to certain financial covenant conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We may not meet those ratios and tests.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Indenture governing the Notes, under the credit agreement governing the GSSCF, or under other debt instruments could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors under such facility to accelerate the related debt, which may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our GSSCF would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under these facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the GSSCF or under other secured debt instruments, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the GSSCF. In the event our lenders or holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow or pursue other important initiatives in accordance with our growth strategy.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our GSSCF are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net\nincome and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $371.8 million of our debt was variable rate debt. Our anticipated annual interest expense on $371.8 million variable rate debt at the current rate of 5.7 percent would be $21.2 million. We have entered into interest rate swaps exchanging floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. As of December 31, 2019, we have executed interest rate swaps for $260.0 million, maturing $25.0 million March 31, 2020, $35.0 million December 31, 2020, $50 million September 30, 2022, and $150 million December 31, 2022. In the future, we may again enter into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nThe interest rates under our USD SSCF are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the Administrative Agent under the USD SSCF will apply or such other reference rate as may be agreed by the Company and the lenders under the credit agreement governing the USD SSCF. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nGenerally, we obtain our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements from various sources. Although we currently maintain alternative sources, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials may be driven by the supply and demand for that commodity or governmental regulation, including trade laws and tariffs. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are able to periodically pass certain aluminum cost increases on to our customers, we may not be able to pass along all changes in aluminum costs (e.g. for aftermarket), or there may be a delay in passing the aluminum costs onto our customers. Our customers are not obligated to accept energy or other supply cost increases that we may attempt to pass along to them. This inability to pass on these cost increases to our customers could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows.\nAluminum and alloy pricing, and the timing of our receipt of payment from customers for aluminum price fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nThe cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel and in our selling prices to customers. Customer prices are adjusted for fluctuations in aluminum prices based on changes in certain published market indices, but the timing of price adjustments is based on specific customer agreements and can vary from monthly to quarterly. As a result, the timing of aluminum price adjustments with customers flowing through sales rarely will match the timing of such changes in cost and can result in fluctuations to our gross profit. This is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum.\nThe aluminum we use to manufacture wheels also contains additional alloy materials, including silicon. The cost of alloying materials is also a component of the overall cost of a wheel. The price of the alloys we purchase is also based on certain published market indices; however, most of our customer agreements do not provide price adjustments for changes in market prices of alloying materials. Increases or decreases in the market prices of these alloying materials could have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nThere is a risk of discontinuation of the E.U. anti-dumping duty from China which may increase the competitive pressure from Chinese producers, including in the aftermarket.\nIn 2010, the European Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties of 22.3 percent on imports of aluminum road wheels from China after a complaint of unfair competition from European manufacturers. The European Commission argued that the EU manufacturers had suffered a significant decrease in production and sales, and a loss of market share, as well as price depression due to cheaper imports from China. On January 23, 2017, the European Commission decided to maintain the anti-dumping duties (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/109) for another five-year period. The anti-dumping duties protect the EU producers until January 24, 2022. After this date, the competitive pressures from Chinese producers, which have cost advantages, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws.\nWe incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to be in compliance with such laws and regulations could result in material fines or sanctions. Additionally, changes to such laws or regulations may have a significant impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes and the health and safety of our employees. The nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, some of our properties are subject to indemnification and/or cleanup obligations of third parties with respect to environmental matters. However, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of such third parties, we could be required to assume the liabilities that would otherwise be the responsibility of such third parties.\nFurther, changes in legislation or regulation imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, or otherwise impacting or limiting our equipment and operations or from the vehicles that use our products could adversely affect demand for those vehicles or require us to incur costs to become compliant with such regulations.\nWe are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We are exposed to potential product liability and warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of automotive products, the failure of which could result in property damage, personal injury or death. Accordingly, individual or class action suits alleging product liability or warranty claims could result. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against future liabilities. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business requires extensive product development activities to launch new products. Accordingly, there is a risk that wheels under development may not be ready by the start of production or may fail to meet the customer\u2019s specifications. In any such case, warranty or compensation claims might be raised, or litigation might be commenced, against the Company.\nMoreover, there are risks related to civil liability under our customer supply contracts (civil liability clauses in contracts with customers, contractual risks related to civil liability for causing delay in production launch, etc.). If we fail to ensure production launch as and when required by the customer, thus jeopardizing production processes at the customer\u2019s facilities, this could lead to increased costs, giving rise to recourse claims against, or causing loss of orders by the Company. This could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management team, which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends, to a significant extent, on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. During the last several years we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management members, additional losses of members of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. Any security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCompetitors could copy our products or technologies and we could violate protected intellectual property rights or trade secrets of our competitors or other third parties.\nWe register business-related intellectual property rights, such as industrial designs and trademarks, hold licenses and other agreements covering the use of intellectual property rights, and have taken steps to ensure that our trade secrets and technological know-how remain confidential. Nevertheless, there is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, our products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company secrets, technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to ours, and thus potentially compete with us.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not unknowingly infringe intellectual property rights of our competitors, such as patents and industrial designs, especially due to the fact that the interpretations of what constitutes protected intellectual property may differ. Similarly, there is a risk that we will illegitimately use intellectual property developed by our employees, which is subject in each case to relevant regulations governing employee-created innovations. If a dispute concerning intellectual property rights arises, in which the relevant court issues an opinion on the disputed intellectual property rights contrary to us, identifying a breach of intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or to stop the use of such intellectual property. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of injunctions being imposed to prevent further infringement, leading to a decrease in the number of customer orders.\nAll these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nImpairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $184.8 million of goodwill which represented approximately 14.1 percent of total assets on our consolidated balance sheet related to our acquisition of Uniwheels. Goodwill is not amortized but we test it for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31, or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred, which could result in recognition of a goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by a threatened proxy contest with two stockholders who have each nominated an individual for election to our Board of Directors at the 2020 annual meeting.\nWe recently received notices from each of GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (\u201cGAMCO\u201d) and D.C. Capital LLC (\u201cD.C. Capital\u201d) announcing their intent to each nominate one individual for election to our Board of Directors at the 2020 annual meeting. If a proxy contest results from one or both notices received from GAMCO or D.C. Capital, our business could be adversely affected. Responding to nominations by activist stockholders are costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to comply with conditions of the state tax incentive programs in Poland.\nWe have three production plants in a special Poland economic zone, Tanobrzeska Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna Euro-Park Wislosan in Stalowa Wola, Poland. Our Polish operations were granted eight permits to operate in this special economic zone, which allows us to benefit from Polish state tax incentives. The permits require certain conditions to be met, which include increasing the number of employees, keeping the number of employees at such level and incurring required capital expenditures. In addition, particular permits indicate deadlines for completion of respective stages of investments. For three of the eight permits, conditions have already been fulfilled. If we do not fulfill the conditions required by the permits, the permits might be withdrawn and we would no longer benefit from state tax incentives, which may impact our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a material way. Furthermore, under current Polish regulations, special economic zones are scheduled to cease to exist in 2026.\nWe are currently unable to fully deduct interest charges on German and US indebtedness.\nThe interest deduction barrier under German tax law (Zinsschranke) and US tax law limit the tax deductibility of interest expenses. If no exception to these limits apply, the net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) is deductible up to 30 percent of the EBITDA taxable in Germany and the US, respectively, in a given financial year. Non-deductible interest expenses can be carried forward. Interest carry-forwards are subject to the same tax cancellation rules as tax loss carry-forwards. Whenever interest expenses are not deductible or if an interest carry-forward is lost, the tax burden in future assessment periods could rise, which might have alone, or in combination, a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to existing and future profit and loss transfer agreements executed with German subsidiaries of our European operations.\nProfit and loss transfer agreements are one of the prerequisites of the taxation of Superior and its German subsidiaries as a German tax group. For tax purposes, a profit and loss transfer agreement must have a contract term for a minimum of five years. In addition, such agreement must be fully executed. If a profit and loss transfer agreement or its actual execution does not meet the prerequisites for the taxation as a German tax group, Superior Industries International AG (\u201cSII AG\u201d) and each subsidiary are taxed on their own income (and under certain circumstances even with retrospective effect). Additionally, 5 percent of dividends from the subsidiary to SII AG, or other Superior European controlling entities within the European Union would be regarded as non-deductible expenses at the SII AG level, or level of other Superior European controlling entities. Furthermore, the compensation of a loss of a subsidiary would be regarded as a contribution by SII AG into the subsidiary and thus, would not directly reduce SII AG\u2019s profits. As a consequence, if the profit and loss transfer agreements do not meet the prerequisites of a German tax group, this could have a future material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPurchase of additional shares of Uniwheels may require a higher purchase price.\nSuperior executed a Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement, \u201cDPLTA\u201d, which became effective in January 2018. According to the terms of the DPLTA, SII AG offered to purchase any outstanding shares of Uniwheels for cash consideration of Euro 62.18. The cash consideration paid to shareholders, which tendered under the DPTLA may be subject to change based on appraisal proceedings that the minority shareholders of Uniwheels have initiated.", "PERMNO": 52396, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SUP"}
