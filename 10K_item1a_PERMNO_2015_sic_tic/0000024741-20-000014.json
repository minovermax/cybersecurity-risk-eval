Risk Factors\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks. Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our Strategy & Growth framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt. The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with our MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nAs a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results\nWe are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers. Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products.\nCompliance with laws and regulations increases our costs. We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:\n\uf0b7The economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries;\n\uf0b7Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;\n\uf0b7Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;\n\uf0b7Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning\u2019s profitability and assets;\n\uf0b7Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;\n\uf0b7Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;\n\uf0b7Periodic health epidemic concerns;\n\uf0b7Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;\n\uf0b7Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;\n\uf0b7Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;\n\uf0b7Complex, changing or competing tax regimes;\n\uf0b7Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;\n\uf0b7Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and\n\uf0b7Potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.\nCorning\u2019s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company\u2019s profits and cash flow. Any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results\nCorning\u2019s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies. If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nBecause we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers\nA relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments. Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning\u2019s customer base. Further concentration, or the loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.\nThe following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nBusiness disruptions could affect our operating results\nA major earthquake, weather event, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities, or our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 facilities, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water. Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.\nWe have been closely monitoring the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. We have operations in Wuhan and other areas of China. We have taken steps to protect our employees and operations. The coronavirus may impact the global economy, our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could result in an impact to our financial results. We are taking steps to mitigate potential financial impacts, including supplying customers from other regions when appropriate. Currently, it is not possible for us to determine the financial impact of the coronavirus, if any.\nAdditionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in single-site locations. Due to the specialized nature of the assets, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities. Accordingly, disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning\u2019s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole.\nGeopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning\u2019s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning\u2019s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity\nA natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war and social or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect Corning\u2019s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets. Such events may also impact our customers\u2019 facilities and reduce our sales to such customers. For example, a sizeable portion of Corning\u2019s glass manufacturing capacity is in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers. Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning\u2019s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.\nGiven the geographical concentration of certain of our plants, the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results.\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nThe intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.\nInformation technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm\nThe Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services, (\u201cIT systems\u201d) to conduct its business. Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events. Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business. A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack. In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).\nWe may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments\nDeveloping our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle. We make significant expenditures and investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return. If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.\nWe have significant exposure to foreign currency movements\nA large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures. Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged increases or decreases significantly and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure.\nOur ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\nOur hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors. Foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment. The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and sell in various currencies.\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nThese factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes. If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed. Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions. To date, some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations. Due to volume and complexity of both of final and proposed regulations, we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 Tax Act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. In addition to the 2017 Tax Act, other foreign countries and international organizations such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.\nOur innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies\nOur innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities. The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nWe are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations\nSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities. We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.\nAny failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.\nCurrent or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations\nAs a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nMoreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.\n\u00a9 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nIndex\nInternational trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. These policies also affect our equity companies.", "PERMNO": 22293, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "GLW"}
