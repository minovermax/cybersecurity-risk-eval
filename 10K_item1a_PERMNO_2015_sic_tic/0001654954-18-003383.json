{"cik": "1140102", "company": "Command Center, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur common stock value and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below. If any of the following risks actually occur, our common stock, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value of your investment could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. These risk factors should be carefully considered together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in the general economy. The staffing needs of our customers vary greatly with the overall condition of the economy. Even though the economy is currently experiencing a period of growth, there is a risk that conditions will change, and that the economic climate in the future will become more volatile, or uncertain. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. During periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for staffing services typically declines. When demand drops, our business is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a decrease of our revenue but our selling and administrative expense base may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we can only reduce selling and administrative expenses to a certain level without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, during economic downturns companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our customers become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer. Deterioration of general economic conditions could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to downturns in regional and local economies. As of March 28, 2018, we own and operate 67 branches across 23 states. As such, we are subject to regional and local economic conditions in many markets. Additionally, our new branches are sometimes placed in metropolitan areas where we have one or more existing branches, increasing our exposure to future economic weakness in those local areas. Deterioration in regional and local economic conditions in the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a number of key customers and if we lose any one of these customers, our revenues may decline. Although we have a significant number of customers in each of the geographic markets that we operate in, we rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In 2017, our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue in 2017. Additionally, at December 29, 2017, 11.8% of total accounts receivable was due from a single customer. In 2016, our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue in 2016. In the future, a small number of customers may represent a significant portion of our total revenues in any given period. These customers may not consistently use our services at a particular rate over any subsequent period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nWe are vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations with lower demand in the fall and winter months. Revenues generated from branches in markets subject to seasonal fluctuations will be less stable and may be lower than in other markets. Locating branches in highly seasonal markets involves higher risks. Our individual branch revenue can fluctuate significantly on both a quarter over quarter and year over year basis, depending on the local economic conditions and need for temporary labor services in the local economy. One of our goals is to increase the diversity of customers and industries we service at both the branch and the company level. This will reduce the potential negative impact of an economic downturn in any one industry or region. To the extent that we consider the opening of new branches, we intend to select branch locations with a view to maximizing total long-term return on our investment in branches, personnel, marketing, and other fixed and sunk costs. However, there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected by low returns on investment in certain highly-seasonal markets. Weather can also have a significant impact on our operations as there is typically lower demand for staffing services during adverse weather conditions in the winter months.\nA currently pending proxy contest has caused us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and may have other adverse effects on our business. On November 29, 2017, Ephraim Fields filed a preliminary proxy statement nominating five candidates for election to our Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in opposition to the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors. Responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be disruptive, costly and time-consuming, and can divert the attention of management and our employees. We have incurred significant expenses for legal, consulting and administrative fees. We anticipate we will incur future expenses in connection with this proxy contest depending on how long it takes to get to a resolution, which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, this proxy contest and any similar activist stockholder initiatives leads to perceived uncertainties as our future direction, strategy, leadership and may lead to the perception of instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers or vendors, or cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. Such perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may harm our ability to attract investors in order to raise capital, in the event we need to raise capital, and may impact our existing and potential relationships and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our business plans. We believe a continuing proxy contest by the activist stockholder could materially and adversely affect our business, our prospects, and stockholder value.\nWe could experience a change of control as a result of the actions of activist stockholders. On November 29, 2017, Ephraim Fields filed a preliminary proxy statement nominating five candidates for election to our Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in opposition to the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors. The replacement of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors in a proxy contest could result in a change of control. Such change of control might alter our business strategy and direction in ways we cannot currently predict which could result in a negative impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, a change of control could have consequences under our material agreements. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock, impact our existing and potential relationships and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. We believe partial or full success by the activist shareholder could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and our shareholders may have difficulty reselling their shares when desired or at attractive market prices. Our stock price and our listing may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive prices. Our Company stock trades on the \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market and is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Our common stock has continued to trade in low volumes and at low prices. On December 7, 2017, we effected a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of our common and preferred stock which also affected our trading volume. Some investors view low-priced stocks as unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for investment. Many brokerage firms and institutional investors have internal policies prohibiting the purchase or maintenance of positions in OTC or low-priced stocks.\n\u201cPenny stock\u201d rules may make buying or selling our securities difficult and impact liquidity. Trading in our securities may be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for our securities.\nLoss of key management personnel could negatively affect our business. We have a small management team and we are highly dependent on principal members of our management team to operate our business. The loss of any key executive, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. On February 1, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer of five years resigned effective April 1, 2018. With his departure we will lose valuable expertise and knowledge he gained while managing our Company, and it may require new management substantial time and efforts to regain this expertise and knowledge. During this transition period, a newly hired or interim Chief Executive Officer may not have the depth of knowledge to execute our business plans. Our future performance also depends on our ability to identify, recruit, motivate, and retain key management personnel. The failure to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we lose members of our Board of Directors, our ability to manage our business could be impaired. On January 16, 2018 and January 22, 2018, our Chairman of the Board John Stewart and our member of the Board Richard Finlay resigned. To date, our Board has not appointed replacement Board members. Our ability to attract and retain qualified Board members is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position, and future prospects. With the departure of these two long-time Board members, our Board also lost valuable expertise and knowledge, and the Board may require substantial time and efforts to regain this expertise and knowledge. Newly appointed or elected Board members will need time to gain the knowledge become acquainted with our business. The success of Command Center is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our Board members. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified Board members, our business performance, competitive position, and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nDifficulty in attracting, developing, and retaining qualified branch personnel could negatively affect our business. We rely significantly on the performance and productivity of our branch managers and business development specialists to help drive new business to our growing number of branches. Each branch manager has primary responsibility for managing the operations of the individual branch, including recruiting workers, daily dispatch of personnel, collection of accounts receivable, and overall customer service. To combat a typically high turnover rate for branch managers in the on-demand labor industry, we continue to develop and refine our training and compensation plans to encourage employee retention. There is no assurance that our training and compensation plans will reduce turnover in this position.\nLoss of key personnel could negatively affect our business. The loss of any key executive could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future performance also depends on our ability to identify, recruit, motivate, and retain key management personnel. The failure to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnavailability of a reliable pool of field team members may negatively impact our business. On-demand labor companies must continually attract reliable temporary workers to meet customer needs. We compete for such workers with other temporary labor businesses, as well as with actual and potential customers, some of which seek to fill positions directly with regular or field team members. In addition, our field team members sometimes become regular employees of our customers. From time to time, during peak periods and/or in certain geographic regions, we may experience shortages of available temporary workers.\nWe are dependent upon the continued availability of workers' compensation insurance. We maintain workers' compensation insurance as required by state laws. Very few insurance carriers provide workers' compensation coverage for staffing companies in the manual labor market. We expect the insurance market to tighten even further in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable terms, coverages, deductibles and collateral requirements. In most of the states in which we operate, we cannot engage in business without workers' compensation insurance. In order to obtain coverage, we are required to post collateral with the carrier in the form of cash or a letter of credit from our lender. The carrier can retain this collateral for extended periods of time, and increase the amount of such collateral.\nIncreased workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums could negatively affect operating results. Workers\u2019 compensation expenses and the related liability accrual are based on our actual claims experience. Currently, as we have throughout most of our corporate history, we maintain a large deductible workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Our current workers\u2019 compensation policy has a deductible limit of $500,000 per incident, and our workers\u2019 compensation policy immediately prior to April 2014 has a deductible limit of $350,000 per incident. For the years prior to April 2011, our policy has a deductible limit of $250,000 per person. As a result, we are substantially self-insured. Our management training and safety programs aim to minimize both the frequency and severity of workers\u2019 compensation insurance claims, but a large number of claims, or a small number of significant claims, could require substantial payments. In Washington and North Dakota, where we purchase our insurance through state workers\u2019 compensation funds, our liability is limited to payment of the insurance premiums. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully limit the frequency and severity of our workers\u2019 compensation claims, or that our insurance premiums and costs will not increase substantially. Higher costs for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, if incurred, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreased competition in our highly competitive industry may impact our ability to retain customers or market share. We operate in a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry. We face competition from a wide variety of companies ranging in size from large, multi-national corporations to small, local sole proprietors. This causes extensive pricing pressure, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain customers or market share going forward, nor that we will be able to maintain profitability or current profit margins.\nWe may not be able to recover collateral deposits we have placed with our workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. Historically our workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers have required collateral deposits to secure our payment of claims up to the amount of our policy deductible. For the two-year period ending March 31, 2014, Dallas National Insurance, now known as Freestone Insurance Company, provided our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a high deductible policy. Under the terms of the policy, we were required to provide cash collateral of $1.8 million as security for payment of claims up to the policy deductible. We are responsible for paying claims up to the deductible amount. In April 2014, the Insurance Commissioner in the State of Delaware placed Freestone in Receivership due to concerns about Freestone\u2019s financial condition. In August 2014, the Receivership was converted into a liquidation proceeding. In late 2015, we filed timely proofs of claim with the Receiver for return of our collateral deposits, one as a priority claim and one as a general claim. On July 5, 2016, the Receiver filed a first accounting with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Pursuant to this accounting, the Receiver reported cash and cash equivalents of $87.7 million as of December 31, 2015. We believe our claim for return of collateral will be a priority claim and our collateral should be returned to us. However, if the Receiver determines that our claim for return of collateral is not entitled to priority status, or if there are not sufficient assets available to pay all of the priority claims, we may not receive any or all of our collateral. As a result of these developments, we believe that an impairment is probable, but we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss. If we do receive any of our collateral deposit back from Freestone, it could result in a loss of up to $1.8 million. This loss of our collateral could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations. We are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, and the SEC. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems. Such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, effective December 30, 2017, FASB revised the manner in which revenue is to be recognized. While we believe the adoption of this revised accounting standard will not have any material effect on our financial statements, this new accounting standard is complex and it is possible that there may be a material adverse impact on our financial statements, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe delay between the time we pay our temporary workers and other creditors and the time we collect from our customers requires debt refinancing to provide working capital. Field team members are typically paid on the same day the services are performed, while customers are generally billed on a weekly basis with 30-day payment terms. We currently have an account purchase agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that allows us to sell eligible accounts receivable for 90% of the invoiced amount on a full recourse basis up to the facility maximum or $14.0 million. When the receivable is collected, the remaining 10% is paid to us, less applicable fees and interest. The term of the agreement is through April 7, 2020. The cancelation of the account purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe delay between the time we pay our temporary workers and the time we collect from our customers requires aggressive management of our credit risk and places pressure on working capital. Pressure on our working capital requires that we manage the resulting credit risk. The magnitude of the risk varies with general economic conditions. We believe that write-offs for doubtful accounts can be maintained at commercially acceptable levels without the need to resort to unduly intrusive credit management practices that could interfere with customer acquisition and retention. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our ability to achieve and sustain profitable operations will not be adversely affected by losses from doubtful accounts or customer relations problems arising from our efforts to manage credit risk.\nLimitations in our receivables financing agreements negatively impact our liquidity. Under our account purchase agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, our borrowing base is limited to the lesser of: (1) 90% of acceptable accounts as defined in the agreement, or (2) $14.0 million. Our collateral requirements with our workers' compensation insurance carrier are secured by a $6.0 million letter of credit from our lender. The amount of the letter of credit results in a reduction to our borrowing base, currently reducing funds otherwise available to us by $6.0 million. This limitation on our liquidity may result in our inability to expand or to sustain our operations, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nIncreased employee expenses could adversely affect our operations. We are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including verification of eligibility for employment, occupational safety and health laws, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance, and equal opportunity employment laws. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees (such as health insurance), increases in the minimum wage or the level of existing benefits, or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We cannot assure that we will be able to increase fees charged to our customers to offset any increased costs and expenses, and higher costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, including those of our third party vendors, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes, and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe will continue to be impacted by new or existing laws and regulations relating to employment. In addition to federal and state laws and regulations, many counties and cities have become active in regulating various aspects of employment, including minimum wages, paid sick leave, application forms and background checks, and required notices to employees, among others. As a staffing company and large employer with a wide geographical footprint, we are often faced with new legal requirements. Although we believe that we will be able to maintain appropriate compliance procedures, there is no assurance that our efforts will always be timely or effective, or that we will be able to recover the increased cost of new legal requirements through timely pricing increases to our customers.\nWe are not in compliance with Washington state law because it has been more than 15 months since our last annual meeting. The Business Corporation Act of Washington requires that a Washington corporation hold a meeting of shareholders annually for the election of directors. Our last shareholder meeting was held on November 17, 2016. We have not held a meeting of shareholders during 2017 because of the pending proxy contest. A court may require us to hold an annual meeting of shareholders upon petition of a shareholder and fix the time and place of the meeting. The failure to hold an annual meeting may also impair our ability to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Market should our Board decide to pursue such uplisting and in the event we meet all other criteria for such uplisting.\nWe may incur additional tax liabilities that exceed our estimates. We are subject to federal taxes and a multitude of state and local taxes. We are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially harm our business. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for determining tax liabilities, or change their laws, which could increase our effective tax rate and negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional costs and regulatory risks relating to new laws regulating the hiring of undocumented workers. In addition to federal laws, the statutes of several states regulate employer practices relating to the identification and eligibility to work of new hires. We have implemented procedures intended to meet all of these requirements. We process information on each new employee through the federal government\u2019s E-Verify system. Although we believe that we are in compliance and we will be able to maintain appropriate procedures, we cannot assure that our compliance will not be flawed or delayed because of the large number of temporary personnel that we employ. In some cases, the penalties for noncompliance are punitive. Regulatory requirements imposed on employers and enforcement actions relating to immigration status of employees are expected to increase. If we are not able to maintain appropriate compliance procedures, our operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will incur additional costs and regulatory risks relating to the impact of health care reform upon our business and failure to comply with such rules and regulations could materially harm our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Laws, include various health-related provisions that took effect in 2015 and 2016, including the requirement that most individuals have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, beginning in 2016 tax penalties are assessable on large employers which do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to our qualifying temporary workers, or the payment of tax penalties if such coverage is not provided, will increase our costs. The economic impact of the Health Care Reform Laws to us is not yet known. It is likely that the Health Care Reform Laws will be revised or rewritten pursuant to proposed legislation. The requirements and the cost impact of revisions to existing laws, Health Care Reform Laws, or new health care legislation is unknown. Under both the present laws and proposed legislation, if we are unable to raise the rates we charge our customers to cover the costs of these programs, such increases in costs could materially harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs from field team members, customers, or third parties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. As the employer of record, we are at risk for claims brought by our field team members, such as wage and hour claims, discrimination and harassment actions and workers' compensation claims. We are also at risk for liabilities alleged to have been caused by our field team members (such as claims relating to personal injuries, property damage, immigration status, misappropriation of funds or property, violation of environmental laws, or criminal activity). Significant instances of these types of issues may impact our customers\u2019 perception of us and may have a negative effect on our results of operations. The risk is heightened because we do not have control over our customers\u2019 workplace or direct supervision of our field team members. If we are found liable for the actions or omissions of our field team members or our customers, and adequate insurance coverage is not available, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetitive factors may require us to absorb increases in operating costs, and we may lose volume as a result. We expect to raise prices for our services in amounts sufficient to offset increased costs of services, operating costs, and cost increases due to inflation, regulatory requirements and to improve our return on invested capital. However, competitive factors may require us to absorb cost increases, which would have a negative effect on our operating margins. Even if we are able to increase costs as desired, we may lose volume to competitors willing to service customers at a lower price.\nWe face competition from companies that have greater resources than we do and we may not be able to effectively compete with these companies. There are several very large full-service and specialized temporary labor companies competing in national, regional and local markets. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense and we expect this level of competition to remain high and to increase in the future. Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is also a risk that competitors, perceiving our lack of capital resources, may undercut our prices or increase promotional expenditures in our strongest markets in an effort to force us out of business.\nImproper disclosure of employee and customer data could result in liabilities and harm our reputation. In the course of our business, we collect, store, use, and transmit information about our employees and customers. Protecting the privacy of this information is critical to our business. We have established a system of controls for safeguarding the security and privacy of our data. Our security controls may not, in every case, be adequate to prevent unauthorized internal or external intrusions into our systems and improper disclosure of personal data and confidential information relating to our employees, our customers or our business. The regulations relating to the security and privacy of information are increasingly prevalent and demanding. The failure to adequately protect private information could expose us to claims from employees and customers and regulatory actions, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or employee concerns may cause higher operating expenses.\nCyberattacks or other breaches of our technology hardware and software, as well as risks associated with compliance and data privacy could have an adverse effect on our systems, our service to our customers, our reputation, our competitive position, and financial results. Our ability to manage our operations successfully is critical to our success. Our business relies on our ability to electronically gather, compile, process, store and distribute data and other information. Unintended interruptions or failures resulting from computer and telecommunications failures, equipment or software malfunction, power outages, catastrophic events, security breaches (such as unauthorized access by hackers), social engineering schemes, unauthorized access, errors in usage by our employees, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, and other events could harm our business. While we have taken measures to minimize the impact of these problems, the proper functioning of these systems is critical to our business operations. Any security breach or failure in our computer equipment, systems or data could result in the interruption of our business operations, tarnish our reputation, and expose us to damages and litigation.\nOur directors, officers and current principal stockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and could limit other stockholders\u2019 influence over corporate decisions. As of March 28, 2018, our directors, officers and current stockholders holding more than 5% of our common stock collectively beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders acting together, may be capable of controlling most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, approval of mergers, and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders, and they may act in a manner with which some stockholders may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of all stockholders.\nWe will likely be party, from time to time, to various legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims. We anticipate that, disputes may arise in the future relating to contract, employment, labor relations, and other matters that could result in litigation or arbitration. These proceedings could divert the attention of our management team and result in costly or unfavorable outcomes. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense, reduce profits harm our reputation, and have a materially adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Also see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\nOur customer contracts contain termination provisions that could decrease our future revenues and earnings. Most of our customer contracts are either day-to-day or can be terminated by the customer on short notice without penalty. Our customers are, therefore, not contractually obligated to continue to do business with us in the future. This creates uncertainty with respect to the revenues and earnings we may recognize with respect to our customer contracts.\nWe have a history of net losses. Although we have recorded a net profit in several of our most recent fiscal years, as of December 29, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $36.0 million. We have incurred net losses in many of our fiscal years since inception. We may incur additional operating losses. We make no assurance that our revenue will increase or that we will be profitable in any future period.\nIf our goodwill is impaired, we will record an additional non-cash charge to our results of operations and the amount of the charge may be material. At least annually, or whenever events or circumstances arise indicating impairment may exist, we review goodwill for impairment as required by U.S. GAAP. In 2014, we wrote-off approximately $807,000 in goodwill relating to our 2012 acquisition of Disaster Recovery Services. In addition, on June 3, 2016, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Hanwood Arkansas, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, and Hanwood Oklahoma, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company. Together these companies operated as Hancock Staffing, or Hancock, from branches located in Little Rock, Arkansas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In connection with our 2016 acquisition of Hancock, we identified and recognized $1.3 million in goodwill that we added to the carrying amount of $2.5 million from the acquisition of Disaster Recovery Services after the write-off. The resulting carrying amount of $3.8 million could change if there are future changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, ability to perform at levels that were forecasted, or a permanent change to our market capitalization. In the future, we may need to further reduce the carrying amount of goodwill by taking an additional non-cash charge to our results of operations. Such a charge would have the effect of reducing goodwill with a corresponding impairment expense and may have a material effect upon our reported results. The additional expense may reduce our reported profitability or increase our reported losses in future periods and could negatively affect the market for our securities, our ability to obtain other sources of capital, and may generally have a negative effect on our future operations.", "PERMNO": 17875, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "HQI"}
