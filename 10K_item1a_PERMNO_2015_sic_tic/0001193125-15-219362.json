RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and our other reports and filings made with the SEC in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the risks discussed in this Annual Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Some statements in this Annual Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history with respect to our principal business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results, and our business may not be successful.\nAlthough we were incorporated in 1997, our business model and strategy has changed significantly due to our acquisition of the Spectrum Assets and our plans to deploy a dispatch-centric network in 20 major metropolitan areas in the United States. As a result, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model our future growth and expenses. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new businesses in highly competitive and technical markets. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not manage or address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. Any success that we may experience in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nbuild out our dispatch-centric network;\n\u2022\nexpand and retain our customer base on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nattract and incentivize dealers to sell our services;\n\u2022\nadd new customers and increase revenues from existing customers by adding users, devices and additional services;\n\u2022\nobtain FCC approval for our Joint Petition for Rulemaking requesting the realignment of a portion of the 900MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband;\n\u2022\nmaintain our existing services business, which requires the continuation of our existing relationships with wireless carriers;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully compete in our markets;\n\u2022\ncontinue to add features and functionality to our solutions to meet customer demand;\n\u2022\nintegrate our existing pdvConnect technologies with the PTT systems we are deploying; and\n\u2022\nscale our internal business operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nWe have had net losses each year since our inception, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $14,714,168, $1,211,821 and $1,239,918 in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report related to our new business model and strategy. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed.\nPage\nThe wireless communications industry is highly competitive, and in order for us to compete effectively we will need to gain market share.\nThere are currently several national wireless communications services providers and many local two-way SMR radio operators providing two-way PTT dispatch services. Moreover, the market for PTT dispatch services is entrenched. In order for us to compete effectively, we will need to demonstrate the superiority of our services and products and convert customers from existing services providers. Our efforts to convert customers from existing services providers will be made more difficult by the fact that the market for PTT dispatch services is highly fragmented, and we will need to tailor our marketing approach to many different categories of customers. If we are unable to acquire a substantial number of customers, our ability to grow our business and our operating results will suffer.\nSome of our competitors are financially stronger than we are, which may limit our ability to compete based on price.\nBecause of their resources and, in some cases, ownership by larger companies, some of our competitors are financially stronger than we are, which may enable them to offer services to customers at prices that are below the prices at which we can offer comparable services. If we cannot compete effectively based on the price of our service offerings, our revenues and growth may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, national wireless communications services providers that offer cellular phone services that do not incorporate a PTT function often provide customers with free or significantly discounted or subsidized handsets as an enticement to sign up for their particular suite of services. The higher cost of the handsets that we will offer our customers, as compared to digital handsets that do not incorporate a similar PTT dispatch-centric, multi-function capability, may make it more difficult or less profitable for us to attract customers. Moreover, the higher cost of our handsets combined with the offering of free handsets by some wireless communications services providers will require us to absorb part of the cost of offering our handsets to new and existing customers. These increased costs for our target customers to acquire handsets for use on our network and any handset subsidy expenses we may need to absorb to offset a portion of these increased costs may reduce our growth and profitability.\nIf other wireless vendors or services providers improve their existing PTT dispatch services that become comparable to ours, our competitive advantage will be reduced.\nOne of the primary ways in which we will differentiate ourselves is through our two-way PTT services. A number of wireless equipment vendors already offer or plan to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing PTT services or technologies that compete or will compete with our services and technology offerings. If these PTT services or technologies are perceived to be or become, or if any such services introduced in the future are, comparable to our PTT service or technology offerings, our competitive advantage will be reduced, which in turn could adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, the largest national wireless communications service providers by revenue do not currently focus on PTT dispatch services as a primary component of their businesses. However, if that were to change, it would likely be difficult for us to compete effectively with such providers. These larger service providers have larger existing customer bases that they will be able to introduce PTT dispatch services to, have more money to spend on research and development that may enable them to create products that are qualitatively superior to ours and may have the ability to operate successfully on a smaller profit per subscriber margin due to the larger volume of customers they service.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes, we may not be able to attract and retain customers.\nWe will need to be able to evolve the technology that we rely upon in supplying the suite of services that we offer in order to solve the problems of our business customers. Future technological advancements may occur\nPage\nquickly and may enable other wireless technologies to equal or exceed our current levels of service and render our technology obsolete. If we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis, or at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose customers to our competitors. In addition, competition among the differing wireless communications technologies could:\n\u2022\nfurther segment the user markets, which could reduce the demand for, and competitiveness of, our technology; and\n\u2022\nreduce the resources devoted by third party suppliers, such as Motorola, to developing or improving the technology for our systems.\nIf our customers do not adopt our technology or if they do not renew their services with us, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nIn order to begin selling our services, we must launch our network and build a customer base. Our strategy depends on building and maintaining a loyal customer base, because we will not have long-term contracts (like most of our local SMR system operator competitors). Because of the number of participants in the industry, we will need to work with sales and service teams like Motorola\u2019s nationwide dealer network to obtain customers and maintain those relationships. Also, if we do not develop new solutions, features and functionality that meet our customers\u2019 needs, we may lose customers. If our efforts to gain customers and sell our services are not effective, our business will suffer.\nGiven our limited operating history, we are unable to accurately predict our customer expansion or renewal rates. Our customer expansion and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all.\nIf we do not enter our targeted markets quickly enough, it may not be possible for us to compete effectively.\nWe currently intend to deploy our products and services in 20 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. In addition to containing a large number of potential customers, we intend to select markets that are strategically located throughout the United States in order to provide our brand with a high degree of visibility that will help us grow and potentially expand into other markets at a later time. However, if we are not able to offer our products and services in these initial crucial markets quickly enough, other services providers may be able to deploy their services and products and sign up a large enough number of customers in these markets in the interim, which would make it impossible for us to enter these markets. If we are unable to enter into 20 major metropolitan markets, we do not believe that we will be able to compete effectively, and our profitability and growth will be negatively affected.\nWe intend to rely on the equipment and selling efforts of other parties, such as Motorola, and if such parties are unable or unwilling to provide us with such equipment or selling efforts, our operations will be adversely affected.\nOur DispatchPlus wireless communication technology will rely on the efforts of other parties, such as Motorola\u2019s nationwide dealer network, to act as our indirect sales representatives. We will also need to rely on other parties to provide us with technological improvements designed to expand our wireless capacity and improve our services. Accordingly, we must rely on other parties, such as Motorola, to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services that we plan to offer to our customers. In addition to relying on other parties for technology and equipment, we will rely on an indirect sales force to market our products and services to customers.\nThe parties that we rely upon could choose not to promote our services or may receive better incentives from our competitors. If these or other factors affecting our relationship with such parties were to result in a significant\nPage\nadverse change in such parties\u2019 ability or willingness to provide handsets and related equipment and software applications, or to develop new technologies or features for us, or in such parties\u2019 ability or willingness to do so on a timely, cost-effective basis, we may not be able to adequately service our existing customers or add new customers and may not be able to offer competitive services. Accordingly, a decision by one of these parties to discontinue manufacturing, supporting or enhancing our infrastructure and handsets or to discontinue marketing our products would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe parties we rely upon to supply our wireless communications equipment are also significant suppliers of wireless communications equipment to our competitors. These other parties may elect to focus a greater amount of their financial and other resources on the development of enhanced features functionality of standards-based wireless equipment used by our competitors rather than the equipment used by us. In such an event, we might be forced to supply our customers with equipment that is either more costly or qualitatively inferior to the equipment offered by our competitors.\nWe expect to continue to rely principally on Motorola and other third party sales representatives to market and sell our products and to manufacture a substantial portion of the equipment necessary to construct, enhance and maintain our network and handset equipment for at least the next several years. The failure by these other parties to perform as expected could impose significant additional costs on us and adversely affect our operations.\nAgreements with suppliers, such as Motorola, may reduce our operational flexibility and may adversely affect our growth or operating results.\nSuppliers, such as Motorola, provide the infrastructure equipment and substantially all of the handsets throughout our markets under agreements that set the prices we must pay to purchase and license this equipment, as well as a structure to develop new features and make long-term improvements to our network. These agreements may reduce our operational flexibility. Our arrangements with suppliers may delay or prevent us from employing new or different technologies that perform better or are available at a lower cost because of the additional economic costs and other impediments to change generally as well as those that arise under the supplier agreements. In the event that Motorola or another one of our suppliers is unable to deliver the hardware or other equipment which are necessary for our operations, we may not be able to service our clients on a timely basis and our business and growth may be adversely affected.\nThe products and services utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others.\nSome of our products and services use intellectual property that we own. We also purchase products from suppliers, including hardware and device suppliers and service providers that incorporate or utilize intellectual property which we do not own. From time to time our suppliers have received, and we and our suppliers may receive in the future, assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties. These claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to discontinue certain activities or to discontinue selling the relevant products and services. Even when unsuccessful, these claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources. If these claims are successful, we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or stop using certain trademarks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our wireless communications technology does not perform in a manner that meets customer expectations, we will be unable to attract and retain customers.\nCustomer acceptance of the services we offer is and will continue to be affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance and reliability of our network as compared to the networks of our competitors. Participants within our target markets may, instead of switching to our DispatchPlus services\nPage\nincorporating our pdvConnect mobile resource management solution, determine that their communication needs are already adequately serviced by other means of communication and continue using such other means. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers if we are unable to resolve quality issues related to our network as they arise or if those issues were to:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to expand our network coverage or capacity as currently planned; or\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to other wireless service providers in our markets.\nThe current economic environment has made it difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain credit, which could cause our suppliers, distributors and customers to have problems meeting their contractual obligations with us.\nIf our suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders or meet their contractual obligations with us, we may not be able to obtain the services or devices required to meet the needs of our current and future customers, which could cause us to lose current and potential customers to other carriers. If our customers are unable to pay their bills or potential customers feel they are unable to take on additional financial obligations, they may be forced to forgo our services, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may face pressure to reduce prices, which could adversely affect operating results.\nWe and our competitors may decrease prices or increase service and product offerings, resulting in declining average monthly revenue per subscriber in the wireless industry overall. Competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact customer retention. To the extent that we continue to offer more competitive pricing packages, our average monthly revenue per customer may decrease, which could adversely affect our results of operations. If this happens, it may be increasingly difficult for us to remain competitive. We may encounter market pressures to:\n\u2022\nmigrate existing customers to lower priced service offering packages;\n\u2022\nrestructure our service offering packages to offer more value;\n\u2022\nreduce our service offering prices; or\n\u2022\nrespond to particular short-term, market specific situations, such as special introductory pricing or particular new product or service offerings, in a particular market.\nWe have a concentration of risk related to the accounts receivable from two of our third-party carriers and failure to fully collect outstanding balances from these carriers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe sell pdvConnect directly through our sales force and indirectly through third-party carriers. As of March 31, 2015, we have accounts receivable balances owed to us by two of our carriers representing approximately 69% and 22%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balances. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the credit risk, historical trends, and other information, as well as for any specific instances we become aware of that may preclude us from reasonably assuring collection on outstanding balances. Determining the allowance for doubtful accounts is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates. A determination that requires a change in our estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if our carriers fail to pay a significant portion of outstanding accounts receivable balances, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations; the FCC and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects, future growth or results of operations.\nThe FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions, including imposing taxes or fees on our\nPage\nbusiness or that we must pass through to our customers, that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nThe licensing, construction, operation and sale of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.\nThe FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation. There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with FCC requirements applicable to a given license could result in revocation or non-renewal of the license, depending on the nature and severity of the non-compliance.\nVarious states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service, including certain billing practices and consumer-related issues that may not be pre-empted by federal law. If imposed, these regulations could make it more difficult and expensive to implement national sales and marketing programs and could increase the costs of our wireless operations.\nGovernment regulations determine how we operate, which could increase our costs and limit our growth and strategy plans.\nThe FCC regulates the licensing, operation, acquisition and sale of the licensed spectrum that is essential to our business. We may be subject to FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. If we fail to comply with applicable FCC regulations, we may be subject to sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Future changes in regulation or legislation could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations. The FCC and Congress may make additional spectrum available for communications services, which may result in the introduction of additional competitive entrants to the already crowded wireless communications marketplace.\nFurther, some state and local jurisdictions have adopted legislation that could affect our costs and operations in those areas. For example, some jurisdictions have adopted laws restricting or prohibiting the use of portable communications devices while driving motor vehicles, often including PTT devices. If similar laws are enacted in other jurisdictions, we may experience reduced subscriber usage and demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by disruptions arising from causes beyond our control.\nMajor equipment failures, catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, including severe weather, terrorist acts or breaches of network or information technology security that affect wireless networks, including transport facilities, communications switches, routers, microwave links, cell sites or other equipment or third-party owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nPage\nWe may be limited in our ability to grow unless we expand network capacity and coverage and address increased demands on our business systems and processes as needed.\nOur business model depends on our ability to build and grow our subscriber base. To successfully increase our number of customers and pursue our business plan, we must economically:\n\u2022\nexpand the capacity and coverage of our network;\n\u2022\npotentially obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets;\n\u2022\nsecure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites at appropriate locations to meet planned system coverage and capacity targets;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate quantities of base radios and other system infrastructure equipment; and\n\u2022\nobtain an adequate volume and mix of handsets, other user devices and related accessories to meet subscriber demand.\nIf we are unable to achieve increased network capacity, or there are substantial delays in doing so, we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs and otherwise may not be able to successfully increase our number of customers.\nOur operating performance and ability to retain these new customers may be adversely affected unless we are able to timely and efficiently meet the demands for our services and address any increased demands on our customer service, billing and other back-office functions. If we outsource aspects of our customer care function to third parties, we cannot be sure that this outsourcing will not heighten these risks.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our, or our customers\u2019, information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third-party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is an important element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, including location or personal information, or those of service providers, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider, or impacted by unauthorized intentional or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. As a result, our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed or taken without the customers\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, we and third-party service providers process and maintain our proprietary business information and data related to our business-to-business customers or suppliers. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers, may also be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security or that of a third-party service provider, or impacted by unauthorized intentional or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third-party service provider. We also purchase equipment from third parties that could contain software defects, malware, or other means by which third parties could access our network or the information stored or transmitted on such networks or equipment. We may also face increased risks of becoming subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents as we expand our business model and activities to include establishing and operating our own dedicated network. As a result, our business information, or subscriber or supplier data may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed or taken without consent.\nPage\nAny major compromise of our data or network security, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of our services or customer information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, impact our reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our service and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, including litigation, which could be material.\nRisks Related to Our Future Acquisition and Use of Spectrum\nSpectrum is a limited resource, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient spectrum to support our spectrum initiatives and our planned business operations and future growth.\nSpectrum is a limited resource that is regulated in the United States by the FCC. The Spectrum Assets we purchased from Sprint include geographic SMR licenses and site-specific B/ILT licenses. We believe we now own approximately 6 MHz of spectrum on average in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States, although we might not achieve 6 MHz of spectrum in each of the top 20 metropolitan markets. We believe this non-contiguous spectrum is more than sufficient to allow us to operate a nationwide dedicated dispatch network using proven narrowband technologies. Nevertheless, we will need to acquire additional spectrum to support our spectrum initiatives and may need to acquire additional spectrum to support our future business plans and growth or our introduction of new products and technologies. We intend to prioritize our future on acquiring additional FCC licenses for spectrum, including SMR blocks and site specific licenses, that we believe will ease the process of repurposing a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband if and when the FCC approves our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. We may seek to acquire additional spectrum through negotiated purchases, in government-sponsored auctions of spectrum or otherwise. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in acquiring the additional spectrum we may need to support our future growth, our spectrum initiatives, our future network rollout plans or our future product and technology introductions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any failure to obtain the spectrum required for our current and future business plans will adversely impact our revenues and our future growth potential and may adversely impact our ability to obtain FCC approval for our Joint Petition for Rulemaking.\nOur efforts to increase the value of our spectrum may not be successful, or may take more time or be more costly than anticipated.\nWe hold licenses covering, on average, approximately 60% of the private radio band at 900 MHz in the top 20 metropolitan markets in the United States. While this should provide us with sufficient spectrum to allow us to operate a nationwide dedicated dispatch network using proven narrowband technologies, we believe that future demands for high speed data and video services, even in the case of PTT users, should provide an impetus for change to broadband technologies. As a result, in November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC to repurpose all or a portion of the 900 MHz band from narrowband to broadband, possibly leading to 3x3 MHz broadband opportunities. In response to this filing, the FCC issued a public notice requesting public comments from interested third parties and asked a number of questions about our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. A number of interested third parties, including several incumbent operators, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and concern, and asking a number of technical questions about our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. After these public comments were filed, we scheduled and participated in an ex-parte meeting with the FCC to discuss our responses to the questions raised by the FCC and by third parties through the public comment process. In May 2015, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. The proposed rules outline our recommended procedural and technical operating parameters, including field strength limits, and processes related to the administration and sequence of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band. The FCC placed the proposed rules out on public notice requesting comments back by June 29, 2015. There is no assurance that the FCC will adopt our proposed rules. In addition, our proposed rules may not adequately address all of the concerns and questions that have been or may be raised by the FCC or by third parties as part of the rulemaking process.\nPage\nMoreover, before obtaining FCC approval of our Joint Petition for Rulemaking, we believe we will be required to make additional spectrum purchases and to reconfigure our non-contiguous spectrum to achieve a contiguous nationwide 3x3 MHz position. We intend to prioritize our future expenditures on acquiring additional FCC licenses for spectrum, including SMR blocks and site specific licenses, that we believe will ease the process of repurposing a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband if and when the FCC approves our Joint Petition for Rulemaking. Our ability to successfully implement this strategy may take more time and be more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we ultimately may not be able to complete the necessary spectrum acquisitions and reconfiguration. In addition, although we believe our Joint Petition for Rulemaking is proceeding through the FCC process as we anticipated, we expect FCC consideration of any repurposing request to take a significant amount of time, and there is no assurance that the FCC will approve the repurposing of all or any portion of the 900 MHz band (including the licenses that we acquired as part of the Spectrum Assets). We also anticipate that FCC approval may be subject to legal objections from other licensees and users of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band not held by us. As a result, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in obtaining the necessary approvals required to repurpose a portion of the 900 MHz spectrum from narrowband to broadband. Further, the FCC may impose a number of requirements or restrictions on our business as a condition of its potential approval of our realignment request, which may include requiring us to acquire additional spectrum, to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees and pay the cost of their realignment and to utilize an emission mask with advanced filtering capability specifically designed to protect licensees in adjacent bands, all of which would be reflected in the total cost of implementing our realignment request.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of key personnel. Although we have adopted a severance plan for our executive officers, we do not otherwise have long-term employment agreements with our key personnel. In addition, there is no guarantee that these executives will remain employed with us. If any of our key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. The loss of services from key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained and do not expect to obtain key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key personnel.\nWe may not be able to successfully operate our business.\nWe are targeting a very specific niche of the existing market for wireless communications services. The subset of the market within which we seek to focus our services may not prove to be as lucrative as we currently estimate. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to enable us to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and business strategies. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows to pay our operating expenses or service our indebtedness. You should not rely upon the past performance of our management team, as past performance may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe may change our operational policies and business and growth strategies without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.\nOur board of directors determines our operational policies and business and growth strategies. Our board of directors may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, those policies, guidelines and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those we are currently pursuing. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have discovered and may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, in connection with the preparation of the interim financial statements included in a previous filing, our management identified an error in our calculation and reporting of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, and the related net loss per common share (basic and diluted), for the six month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2013 and the nine month period ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, in calculating the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, management incorrectly considered the effect of two corporate actions the Company completed in connection with its June 2014 private placement, including: (i) the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock and (ii) the exchange of nearly all outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock for shares of common stock (the \u201cCorporate Actions\u201d), as if such events occurred at the beginning of each of these reporting periods, instead of only considering the effect of these Corporate Actions after their effective date in June 2014. As a result, our disclosure of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the six month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2013 and the nine month period ended December 31, 2014 were higher, and our disclosure of the related net loss per common share (basic and diluted) were lower, than they should have been if we correctly gave effect to the Corporate Actions only after their effective date in June 2014. Although the corrections have no impact on the Company\u2019s net loss reported in the statements of operations, balance sheets or the statements of cash flows for the above mentioned periods and our audit committee did not determine that our financial statements for such periods should no longer be relied upon as a result of the errors in the presentation of the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, our management identified a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting. To remediate the significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we are developing and implementing new internal control procedures, including additional training and review procedures, to ensure we appropriately track, calculate and report the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, and related net loss per common share (basic and diluted), in future reporting periods.\nPrior to becoming a public company in February 2015, we had not been subject to public reporting requirements and had not been required to assess our internal controls. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing or maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency in the future may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nChanges in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.\nAccounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our operations are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments, such as asset impairments, could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have a limited trading history and there is no assurance that a robust market in our common stock will develop or be sustained.\nOur common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on February 3, 2015. As a result, there is limited trading history and volume in our common stock and we cannot assure you that a more active or liquid trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained if it does develop, either of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of stockholders to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. In addition, our lack of operating history relevant to our proposed business makes it difficult to evaluate our business, our future prospects and the valuation of our Company, which limits the liquidity and volume of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock prices may be volatile which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nPrior to the listing of our shares of common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market in February 2015, there was no public market for our common stock. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect or result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to the level of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nNot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nNot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\nPage\n\u2022\nReduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nExemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report and we have provided only two years of audited financial statements. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Nevertheless at this time, we have elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant in its discretion. Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our common stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nFuture sales of our common stock, other securities convertible into our common stock or preferred stock could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nOur board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock or to raise capital through the creation and issuance of preferred stock, other debt securities convertible into common stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or of preferred stock, could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for future sales, on the value of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by Sprint or Motorola or another large stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the June 2014 private placement, we and our directors and officers agreed, subject to various exceptions, not to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, or, subject to various exceptions, file any registration statement with the SEC until July 25, 2015. In addition, in connection with our May 2015 registered follow-on offering of common stock, we and our directors and officers agreed to similar lock-ups for a period of 90 days, expiring August 10, 2015 (See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Recent Developments\u201d). These lock-up provisions, at any time and without notice, may be released by FBR Capital Markets & Co. in its sole discretion. If the restrictions under the lock-up provisions are waived, shares of our common stock may become available for resale into the market, subject to applicable law, which could reduce the market price for our common stock.\nIn addition, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the total number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under our 2004 Stock Plan, 2010 Stock Plan and 2014 Stock Plan, including the shares of restricted stock granted to our executive officers and directors, as well as the options to purchase shares of our\nPage\ncommon stock granted to our executive officers in connection with the June 2014 private placement. These shares of common stock are eligible for sale without restriction.\nAs of May 27, 2015, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 7.93% of the equity interests in our Company, including restricted stock units and stock options. Subject to vesting restrictions applicable to certain interests held by members of our management team and any applicable transfer restrictions, including any lock-up agreements, each member of our management team may sell such common stock into any market for such shares that may develop.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to pay dividends or make liquidating distributions to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and investors in our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their ownership interest in our Company.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company with securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), we need to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), related regulations of the SEC, and the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time from our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses going forward.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with the second annual report that we will be required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Section 404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year following January 26, 2020, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion,(c) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior September 30th, or the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nCertain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may\nPage\nconsider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a stockholders meeting.\nSelected provisions of Delaware law.\nWe have elected to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) by provision of our charter. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs:\n\u2022\nBefore that person became an interested stockholder, our board of directors approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n\u2022\nUpon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our Company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u2022\nFollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe DGCL generally defines \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person\nPage\nreasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.", "PERMNO": 15226, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "ATEX"}
