{"cik": "842295", "company": "TOR MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1 A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed in the \u201cForward-Looking Statement\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. In addition, you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. If we were unable to adequately respond to any risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks or uncertainties will be successful.\nOur foreign debt is subject to subjective acceleration provisions and demand provisions that allow our lending institutions to accelerate payment at any time. If our foreign debt were accelerated under the demand provisions, our working capital and financial condition would be severely impacted.\nOur subsidiaries are parties to loan agreements with banks in Malaysia and The Netherlands that provide short-term credit facilities and term loans. These borrowings are subject to certain subjective acceleration provisions based on the judgment of the banks and demand provisions that provide that the banks may demand repayment at any time. We believe such a demand provision is customary in Malaysia and The Netherlands for such facilities. At December 31, 2014, our foreign debt consisted of $3,663,000 under the short-term credit facilities and $2,234,000 under the term loans.\nIf demand is made by the banks, we will require additional debt or equity financing to meet our working capital and operational requirements and to refinance our maturing or demanded indebtedness. Should we find it necessary to raise additional funds, we may find that such funds are either not available or are available only on terms that are unattractive in terms of shareholders\u2019 interest. If this debt could not be repaid or refinanced, the banks could foreclose and sell our foreign operations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with declining economic conditions.\nOur financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the United States, the European Union and Asia. Declining economic conditions or negative perceptions about economic conditions in any or all of these locations could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business.\nUncertain economic conditions and market instability make it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to forecast demand trends. Declines in demand would place additional pressure on our results of operations. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. Consequently, at present, we are unable to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial conditions or results of operations, and we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting our industry.\nWe have undertaken cost-savings initiatives to improve our operating performance, but we may not be able to implement and/or administer these initiatives in the manner contemplated and these initiatives may not produce the desired results.\nWe have undertaken cost-savings initiatives and may undertake additional cost-savings initiatives in the future. These initiatives involve, among other things, staff reductions. Although we expect these initiatives to help us achieve incremental cost savings and operational efficiencies, we may not be able to implement and/or administer these initiatives, including staff reductions, in the manner contemplated, which could cause the initiatives to fail to achieve the desired results. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may result in impairment charges, some of which could be material. Even if we do implement and administer these initiatives in the manner contemplated, they may not produce the desired results. Accordingly, the initiatives that we have implemented and those that we may implement in the future may not improve our operating performance and may not help us achieve cost savings. Failure to successfully implement and/or administer these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\n- \t\t8 -\nWe strive to improve operating margins through sales growth, price increases, productivity gains, and improved purchasing techniques, but we may not achieve the desired improvements.\nWe work to improve operating profit margins through activities such as growing sales to achieve increased economies of scale, increasing prices, improving manufacturing processes, and adopting purchasing techniques that lower costs or provide increased cost predictability to realize cost savings. However, these activities depend on a combination of improved product design and engineering, effective manufacturing process control initiatives, cost-effective redistribution of production, and other efforts that may not be as successful as anticipated. The success of sales growth and price increases depends not only on our actions but also on the strength of customer demand and competitors' pricing responses, which are not fully predictable. Failure to successfully implement actions to improve operating margins could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur businesses depend on a continuous stream of new products, and failure to introduce new products could affect our sales, profitability and liquidity.\nOne way that we remain competitive is by developing and introducing new and improved products on an ongoing basis. Customers continually evaluate our products in comparison to those offered by our competitors. A failure to introduce new products at the right time that are price competitive and that provide the features and performance required by customers could adversely affect our sales, or could require us to compensate by lowering prices. In addition, when we invest in new product development, we face risks related to production delays, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical difficulties, which could impact sales, profitability and/or liquidity.\nOur strategy includes seeking opportunities in new growth markets, and failure to identify or successfully enter such markets could affect our ability to grow our revenues and earnings.\nCertain of our products are sold into mature markets and part of our strategy is to identify and enter into markets growing more rapidly. These growth opportunities may involve new geographies, new product lines, new technologies or new customers. We may not be successful capitalizing on such opportunities and our ability to increase our revenue and earnings could be impacted.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to intense price competition, which could adversely affect our sales and earnings performance.\nOur customers typically have multiple suppliers from which to choose. If we are unwilling or unable to provide products at competitive prices, and if other factors, such as product performance and value-added services do not provide an offsetting competitive advantage, customers may reduce, discontinue, or decide not to purchase our products. If we could not secure alternate customers for lost business, our sales and earnings performance could be adversely affected.\nOur multi-jurisdictional tax structure may not provide favorable tax efficiencies.\nWe conduct our business operations in the United States, Malaysia and The Netherlands and are subject to taxation in those jurisdictions. While we seek to minimize our worldwide effective tax rate, our corporate structure may not optimize tax efficiency opportunities. We develop our tax position based upon the anticipated nature and structure of our business and the tax laws, administrative practices and judicial decisions now in effect in the countries in which we have operations, which are subject to change or differing interpretations. In addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several other factors, including: increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, the tax effects of restructuring charges or purchase accounting for acquisitions, changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those related to other-than-temporary impairment, and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Further, we are subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities, which may result in adverse decisions. Increased tax expense could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t - 9 -\nWe are exposed to risks associated with acts of God, terrorists and others, as well as fires, explosions, wars, riots, accidents, embargoes, natural disasters, strikes and other work stoppages, quarantines and other governmental actions, and other events or circumstances that are beyond our control.\nWe are exposed to risks from various events that are beyond our control, which may have significant effects on our results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through appropriate loss prevention measures, insurance, contingency planning and other means, we may not be able to anticipate all risks or to reasonably or cost-effectively manage those risks that we do anticipate. As a result, our operations could be adversely affected by circumstances or events in ways that are significant and/or long lasting.\nThe risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. If any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCosts of raw materials and energy have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased operating expenses and reduced results of operations.\nWe purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for our manufacturing operations. The cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The costs of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of, and vary with the market conditions for crude oil and natural gas, which may be highly volatile and cyclical. Many raw material and energy costs have recently experienced significant fluctuations, reaching historically record high levels. Moreover, the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to other currencies adds to the volatility in raw material costs. There have been, and will likely continue to be, periods of time when we are unable to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations. Our results of operations have been in the past, and could be in the future, significantly affected by increases and volatility in these costs. Cost increases also may increase working capital needs, which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow. In addition, when raw material and energy costs increase rapidly and are passed along to customers as product price increases, the credit risks associated with certain customers can be compounded. To the extent we increase our product sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs, demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption and use substitute products, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nClimate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us, climate change regulation could significantly increase our costs. Energy costs are a significant component of our overall costs, and climate change regulation may result in significant increases in the cost of energy.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers and could experience significant revenue reductions if they use alternative sources.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue each quarter from a limited number of customers. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated sales revenues in 2014. As a result, a decrease in sales volume of any one of our top 10 customers could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2014, one customer represented approximately 23% of our total consolidated sales and the loss of this customer could have a material impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n- \t\t10 -\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition.\nBecause we own assets located outside of the United States and have revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, we may incur currency transaction and translation losses due to changes in the values of foreign currencies and in the value of the U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency exposure from transactions and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are managed by selectively entering into derivative transactions. Translation exposure associated with translating the functional currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars is generally not hedged. Upon translation to the U.S. Dollar, operating results could be significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We cannot predict the effect of changes in exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. (See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other Matters -Foreign Operations - Impact of Exchange Rate\u201d).\nWe are required to make estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different conditions and assumptions.\nOur competitors are established companies that have greater experience than us in a number of crucial areas, including manufacturing and distribution.\nThere is intense competition with respect to each of our products. In order to maintain sales volume, we must consistently deliver high quality products on schedule at competitive prices. Our competitors range from large corporations with full lines of production capabilities and products, such as E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Kronos, Inc., and J. M. Huber, to small local firms specializing in one or two products and, more recently, we have faced competition from a large number of smaller Chinese suppliers. The established companies have significantly greater experience than us in manufacturing and distributing products and have considerably more resources and market share than we do. We may have difficulty competing with these companies.\nOur U.S. operation is located on the Gulf of Mexico coastline and could be adversely affected by hurricanes.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages for hurricanes, particularly during the period ranging from June to November. If a hurricane is severe and our Corpus Christi plant incurs heavy damage and prolonged downtime, which may not be fully covered by insurance, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the storage and transmission of the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose it to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. A number of companies have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at the Company, its customers, or both. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\n- \t\t11 -\nA person who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures could misappropriate the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in its operations, damage its computers or those of its users, or otherwise damage its reputation and business. Any compromise of security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence in its security measures, which could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. The Company may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach by the Company or by persons with whom it has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of its users\u2019 personal information, could damage its reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.\nDoing business in foreign countries carries certain risks that are not found in doing business in the United States.\nWe currently derive a portion of our revenues from operations in Malaysia and The Netherlands. We believe that currently the risks of doing business in Malaysia and The Netherlands are not significant, however, future risks of doing business in these countries, which could result in losses for which we are not insured, include, but are not limited to, the following:\nPotential adverse changes in diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States\nTerrorism\nDisruptions caused by possible foreign conflicts\nHostility from local populations\nAdverse effect of currency exchange controls\nRestrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings\nGovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners\nForeign exchange restrictions\nChanges in taxation structure", "PERMNO": 12190, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TORM"}
