{"cik": "356037", "company": "CSP INC /MA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIf any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below actually materialize, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and a stockholder could lose all or part of its, his or her investment. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue and loss of any customer could significantly affect our business.\nBoth the HPP and TS segments are reliant upon a small number of significant customers, and the loss of or significant reduction in sales to any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately $32.8 million in revenue, or 32% of our total revenues for the fiscal year. A significant reduction in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of our customers to continue to grow or need services or to develop and sell products that incorporate our products. No assurance can be given that our customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel and skilled employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nWe are largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of our senior management, managerial, sales and technical employees. None of our senior management personnel or other key employees are subject to any employment contracts except Victor Dellovo, our Chief Executive Officer and President. The loss of services of any of our executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled technical professionals. Our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and technologies. The inability to hire additional qualified personnel could impair our ability to satisfy our growing client base, requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining current or future employees.\nWe depend on contracts with the federal government for a significant portion of our revenue, and our business could be seriously harmed if the government significantly decreased or ceased doing business with us.\nWe derived 6% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2016 and 5% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2015 from the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") as a subcontractor. We expect that the DoD contracts will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. If we were suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, the General Services Administration, or any significant agency in the intelligence community or the DoD, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies were to be impaired, or if the government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nTo be successful, we must respond to the rapid changes in technology. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop new commercial products on a timely and cost-effective basis in order to respond to technological developments and changing customer needs. The design-in process is typically lengthy and expensive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet the product specifications of our customers in a timely and adequate manner. In addition, if we fail to anticipate or to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or if there is any significant delay in product developments or introductions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the risk of inventory obsolescence. Because of the complexity of our products, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing products on a timely basis. If we are unable to design, develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis, our future operating results would be adversely affected, particularly in our HPP segment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or enhancing our existing products on a timely or cost-effective basis, or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance.\nWe rely on single sources for supply of certain components and our business may be seriously harmed if our supply of any of these components or other components is disrupted.\nSeveral components used in our HPP products are currently obtained from sole-source suppliers. We are dependent on key vendors like Mellanox Technologies for our high-speed interconnect components. Generally, suppliers may terminate our purchase orders without cause upon 30 days' notice and may cease offering products to us upon 180 days' notice. Although we do not consider the risk of interruption of supply to be a significant risk in the near term, if in the future, Mellanox Technologies were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these or other component suppliers, some of which are small companies, were to experience future financial difficulties or other problems which could prevent them from supplying the necessary components, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance risks, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us or our customers, which thereby may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nWe have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. If our supply arrangements are interrupted, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. Any shortage or interruption in the supply of any of the components used in our products, or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that severe shortages of components will not occur in the future. Such shortages could increase the cost or delay the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant increases in the prices of these components would also materially adversely affect our financial performance since we may not be able to adjust product pricing to reflect the increase in component costs. We could incur set-up costs and delays in manufacturing should it become necessary to replace any key vendors due to work stoppages, shipping delays, financial difficulties or other factors and, under certain circumstances, these costs and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks.\nWe market and sell our products in certain international markets and we have established operations in the U.K. and Germany. Foreign-based revenue is determined based on the location to which the product is shipped or services are rendered and represented 31% and 34% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If revenues generated by foreign activities are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign subsidiaries and activities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in transacting business internationally, such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, export controls relating to technology, tariffs and other trade barriers, longer payment cycles, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences, any of which could adversely impact the success of our international activities. A portion of our revenues are from sales to foreign entities, including foreign governments, which are primarily paid in the form of foreign currencies. There can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international activities and, consequently, on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSystems failures may disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, a third party service provider, unauthorized intruders and hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, could cause loss of data or interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients. Like other companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material adverse impact on our business or our financial results, and we believe that our continuing commitment toward threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures will avoid such impact in the future. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, the failure or disruption of our email, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nThe systems and networks that we maintain for our clients, although highly redundant in their design, could also fail. If a system or network we maintain were to fail or experience service interruptions, we might experience loss of revenue or face claims for damages or contract termination. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all the damages that we might incur and, as a result, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe face competition that could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater access to capital and human resources and in many cases price their products and services less than ours. In addition, due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, new competitors may emerge. Competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing or develop products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Such competitors could have a negative impact on our ability to win future business opportunities. There can be no assurance that a new competitor will not attempt to penetrate the various markets for our products and services. Their entry into markets historically targeted by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal government.\nBecause we derive a significant percentage of our revenue from contracts with the federal government, changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.\nIn years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should funding of the federal government by CR be prolonged or extended, and sequestration is not alleviated, it could continue to have significant consequences to our business and our industry.\nAdditionally, our business could be seriously affected if changes in DoD priorities reduces the demand for our services on contracts supporting some operations and maintenance activities or if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for contracts.\nU.S. Federal government contracts contain numerous provisions that are unfavorable to us.\nU.S. Federal government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including allowing the government to:\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\nclaim rights in systems and software developed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;\n\u2022\nimpose fines and penalties and subject us to criminal prosecution; and\n\u2022\ncontrol or prohibit the export of our data and technology.\nIf the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may be unable to recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Depending on the value of a contract, such termination could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nAs is common with government contractors, we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under certain of our contracts. Depending upon the value of the matters affected, a performance problem that impacts\nour performance of a program or contract could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results have fluctuated widely on a quarterly and annual basis during the last several years and we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future operating results. Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, have contributed to these fluctuations in the past and may continue to do so. Such factors include:\n\u2022\nsales in relatively large dollar amounts to a relatively small number of customers;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing programs and volume discounts;\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct obsolescence;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchange in the mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nwhether or not we are able to secure design wins for significant customer systems;\n\u2022\ntiming of significant orders;\n\u2022\ndelays in completion of internal product development projects or introduction of new products;\n\u2022\ndelays in shipping our products;\n\u2022\ndelays in acceptance testing by customers;\n\u2022\nproduction delays due to quality programs with outsourced components;\n\u2022\nshortages of components;\n\u2022\ntiming of product line transitions;\n\u2022\nuncertainty and timing of funding of governmental programs, including defense;\n\u2022\ndeclines of revenues from previous generations of products following announcement of replacement products containing more advanced technology; and\n\u2022\nfixed nature of our expenditures on personnel, facilities and marketing programs.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of our future performance. It is also possible that in some periods, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such circumstances, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe need to continue to expend resources on research and development (\"R&D\") efforts, particularly our HPP segment, to meet the needs of our customers. If we are unable to do so, our products could become less attractive to customers and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry requires a continued investment in research and development (R&D). As a result of our need to maintain or increase our spending levels for R&D in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with R&D, our operating results could be materially harmed if our revenues fall below expectations. In addition, as a result of CSPI's commitment to invest in R&D, spending as a percent of revenues may fluctuate in the future. Further, if we fail to invest sufficiently in R&D or our R&D does not produce competitive results, our products may become less attractive to our customers or potential\ncustomers, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur management identified an internal control material weakness as of September 30, 2014. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting at our foreign subsidiaries, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis.\nThe material weakness is in connection with our controls over the revenue recognition process, specifically that revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied prior to recognizing revenue and the failure to sufficiently assess gross versus net revenue indicators to certain revenue transactions. We determined that controls over the revenue recognition process were not operating effectively and the resulting control gap amounted to a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we had concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2014. Although we have implemented changes to our internal controls over financial reporting, at this time we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary in order for us to provide reliable financial and other reports and effectively prevent fraud. These types of controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the proper preparation of our financial statements, as well as regarding the timely reporting of material information. If we cannot maintain effective internal control or disclosure controls and procedures, or provide reliable financial statements or SEC reports or prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, our common stock could be subject to delisting on the stock exchange where it is traded, our operating results and the trading price of our common stock could suffer and we might become subject to litigation.\nWhile our management will continue to review the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, there is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives, including the prevention and detection of fraud, all of the time.\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile\nHistorically, the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile. Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience, substantial price volatility. The following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly:\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer;\n\u2022\nloss of a major supplier;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of technology companies; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the NASDAQ Global Market and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. If any shareholders were to issue a lawsuit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of management\ncould be diverted.", "PERMNO": 20336, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "CSPI"}
