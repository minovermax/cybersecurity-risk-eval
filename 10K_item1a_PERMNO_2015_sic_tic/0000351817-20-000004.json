{"cik": "351817", "company": "SILVERBOW RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Business:\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results, reduce liquidity and impede our growth.\nOil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022\nlevel of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, Africa and Russia;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position and reduce our liquidity. This would impact the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and continued development of our operations, making it increasingly difficult to operate our business. On February 28, 2020, the Henry Hub NYMEX price for natural gas reached a price of $1.68 per Mcf. Additionally, any extended period of low commodity prices would impact our ability to access funds through the capital markets, if they are available at all.\nInsufficient capital could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Our 2020 capital expenditure budget, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure and fulfillment of abandonment obligations, is expected to be in the range of $175 million and $195 million. We had approximately $261.7 million of capital expenditures in 2019. Cash flow from operations is a principal source of our financing of our future capital expenditures. Insufficient cash flow from operations and inability to access capital could lead to the loss of leases that require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing reserves and production.\nOur Debt Facilities, as defined below, contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Credit Facility and Second Lien (collectively \u201cDebt Facilities\u201d) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nredeem our debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nredeem or prepay other debt;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, divide, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into swap agreements beyond certain maximum thresholds;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if oil and natural gas prices decline further from their current level for an extended period of time, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Debt Facilities or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our Debt Facilities or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf an event of default under either of our Debt Facilities occurs and remains uncured, the lenders or holders under the applicable Credit Facility:\n\u2022\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings or notes outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nmay have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings or notes; or\n\u2022\nmay prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nThe borrowing base under our Credit Facility is redetermined at least semi-annually, based in part on assumptions of the administrative agent with respect to, among other things, crude oil and natural gas prices. A negative adjustment to the borrowing base could occur if crude oil and natural gas prices used by the lenders are significantly lower than those used in the last redetermination, including as result of a decline in commodity prices or an expectation that reduced prices will continue. For example, our borrowing base was decreased from $410 million to $400 million as part of our regularly scheduled redetermination in October 2019. The next redetermination of our borrowing base in scheduled to occur in spring 2020. In addition, the portion of our borrowing base made available to us for borrowing is subject to the terms and covenants of our Credit Facility, including compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility. In the event that the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings.\nIn addition, our obligations under the Debt Facilities are collateralized by perfected first and second priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets, including mortgage liens on oil and natural gas properties having at least 85% of the PV-9 (determined using commodity price assumptions by the administrative agent of the Credit Facility) of the borrowing base properties (with respect to the Credit Facility) or the oil and gas properties constituting proved reserves as set forth in the most recent reserve report (with respect to the Second Lien), and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Debt Facilities, (including any amount of borrowings in excess of the borrowing base resulting from a redetermination of our Credit Facility), the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nMost of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nWe own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established or we exercise an extension option on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have leases on 22,328 net acres that could potentially expire during fiscal year 2020, representing approximately 25% of our net undeveloped acreage.\nOur drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and\nregulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling; therefore, there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nWe have written down the carrying values on our oil and natural gas properties in the past and could incur additional write-downs in the future.\nThe SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the \"ceiling test\"). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. If oil and natural gas prices remain low for an extended period of time, we could be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of our oil and gas properties. Refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation.\nEstimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations.\nThe quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our year-end 2019 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates and could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nA worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect the financial viability of and increase the credit risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties to perform under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Although we have heightened our level of scrutiny of our contractual counterparties, our assessment of the risk of non-performance by various parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. This same crisis may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have.\nOur future access to capital could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could affect our ability to fund our future capital projects. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses, which may be subject to substantial liability claims.\nLosses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nhurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline or tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, blowouts, explosions and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions; and\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities, other property or natural resources, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and natural gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance.\nFurther, we may also elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nPollution and property contamination arising from the Company\u2019s operations and the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators could expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe performance of the Company\u2019s operations may result in significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater or other fluid discharges related to operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Spills or other unauthorized releases of regulated substances by or resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, or the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators, could expose the Company to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Certain of the properties upon which the Company conducts operations were acquired from third parties, whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes at or from such properties were not under the Company\u2019s control. Moreover, certain of these laws may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations the Company could be exposed to liability as a result of the Company\u2019s conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims against the Company for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of pollutants into the environment. New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement relating to environmental requirements may occur, resulting in the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of new or expanded projects, or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Any of these developments could require the Company to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general in addition to the Company\u2019s own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The Company may not be able to recover some or any of its costs with respect to such developments from insurance.\nGovernment regulation of the Company\u2019s activities could adversely affect the Company and its operations.\nThe oil and natural gas business is subject to extensive governmental regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from oil and natural gas wells may be regulated. Governmental regulation also may affect the market for the Company\u2019s production and operations. Costs of compliance with governmental regulation are significant, and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect the results of the Company. We cannot predict the timing or impact of new or changed laws, regulations, or permit requirements or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations, or permit requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. For example, various governmental agencies, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can enact or change, begin to force compliance with, or otherwise modify their enforcement, interpretation or administration of, certain regulations that could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities and could delay the pace or restrict the scope of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA, OSHA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, which may require the Company to take actions resulting in costly capital and operating expenditures at its wells and properties. These laws and regulations may restrict or affect the Company\u2019s business in many ways, including applying specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, requiring the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activities commence, restricting the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, limiting or prohibiting construction or drilling activities on certain lands\nlying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigative, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of the Company\u2019s operations in a particular area. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though the conduct in pursuing the Company\u2019s operations was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by prior operators or other third-parties\nOver time, environmental laws and regulations in the United States protecting the environment generally have become more stringent and are expected to continue to do so in the future. If existing environmental regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, the Company may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures with respect to its continued operations. Examples of recent environmental regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company\u2019s equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Company's capital expenditures and operating costs arising from the program\u2019s operations.\n\u2022\nEPA Review of Drilling Waste Classification. Drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the RCRA and instead, are regulated under RCRA\u2019s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to a federal consent decree issued in 2016, the EPA was required during 2019 to determine whether certain Subtitle D criteria regulations required revision in a manner that could result in oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes. In April 2019, the EPA made a determination that such revision of the regulations was unnecessary. Any future loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nFederal Jurisdiction over Waters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d) under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act, over waters of the United States, including wetlands. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2020, the two agencies issued a final rule redefining the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction over waters of the United States, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. To the extent that any challenge to the January 23, 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction in areas where the Company conducts operations, the Company could incur increased costs and restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or projects, which developments could expose it to significant costs and liabilities.\nAdditionally, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and analogous state occupational safety and health laws require the program manager to organize information about materials, some of which may be hazardous or toxic, that are used, released or produced in the Company\u2019s operations. Moreover, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company\u2019s operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.\nCompliance of the Company with these regulations or other laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental and occupational health and safety legal requirements could, among other things, require the Company to install\nnew or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur significantly increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Moreover, any failure of the Company\u2019s operations to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against the Company that could adversely impact its operations and financial condition.\nThe ESA and other restrictions intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our oil and natural gas operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our ability to explore for and develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nThe ESA and comparable state laws and other regulatory initiatives restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Some of the Company\u2019s operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species and, in these areas, the Company may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and the Company may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when its operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to the Company\u2019s drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, may make determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered or the redesignation of lesser protected species in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations or cancellations on its exploration and production activities, which costs, delays, limitations or cancellations could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to develop and produce reserves. If the Company were to have a portion of its leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of its leases.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) proposed legislation (none of which has passed) to repeal various tax deductions available to oil and natural gas producers as discussed in more detail below and (2) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements, and directs the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines.\nThe foregoing described proposals, including other applicable proposals, could affect our operations and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on the Company, its operations, the demand for oil and natural gas, or the prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect the Company\u2019s production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Company uses hydraulic fracturing techniques in certain of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted studies or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also issued final regulations in 2012 and in 2016 under the CAA that govern performance standards, including standards for the capture of methane and volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. However, in September 2019, EPA\nproposed an amendment to the existing standards that would remove the methane-specific requirements that currently apply in favor of relying on the emission limits for VOCs. Moreover, the EPA has published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the BLM published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s decision to rescind the 2015 rule remains pending in federal district court.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been considered, but not adopted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. However, concern over the threat of climate change has resulted in the making of pledges by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020 to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. Additionally, a bill was introduced in the Senate on January 28, 2020 that, if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025.\nIn addition, certain states, including Texas where we conduct operations, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to place certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local laws, regulations, presidential executive orders or other legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Company operates, the Company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience restrictions, delays or cancellation in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to added restrictions, delays or cancellations with respect to our operations or increased operating costs in our production of oil and natural gas. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations restricting or banning some or all of hydraulic fracturing could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and prohibit or make more difficult or costly the performance of hydraulic fracturing. These developments could adversely affect demand for our production and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nOur operations include the need of water for use in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The Company\u2019s access to water may be limited due to reasons such as prolonged drought, private third party competition for water in localized areas, or the Company\u2019s inability to acquire or maintain water sourcing permits or other rights. In addition, some state and local governmental authorities have begun to monitor or restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to ensure adequate local water supply. Any such decrease in the availability of water could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and operations. Moreover, any inability by the Company to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact the Company\u2019s exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production of oil and natural gas.\nOperations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for construction and operation of such disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and produced water disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas, where the Company conducts operations, as one of six states with more significant rates of induced seismicity. Since that time, the United\nStates Geological Survey indicates that this rate has decreased in Texas, although concern continues to exist over earthquakes arising from induced seismic activities.\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for produced water disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In Texas, the Railroad Commission of Texas has adopted similar rules for the permitting of produced water disposal wells. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells in connection with Company activities to dispose of produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in the Company having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require third party disposal well operators the Company may engage to dispose of produced water generated by Company activities to shut down disposal wells, which development could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production or result in the Company incurring increased costs and delays with respect to Company operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas the Company produces\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nAt the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement CAA emission standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement,\u201d which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020, including proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions with respect to oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquified natural gas export facilities, as well as the rescission of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments, and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related investments. Institutional investors who provide capital to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability issues, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil\nfuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending and investment practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy could restrict the availability of capital, resulting in the restriction, delay, or cancellation of development and production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could require the Company to incur increased operating costs or costs of compliance and thereby reduce demand for the oil and natural gas produced by the Company. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in the Company restricting or cancelling development or production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climate changes, or impairing its ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for or lower the value of, the oil and natural gas the Company produces. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. At this time, the Company has not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social, or physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s operations.\nChanges to the U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislation enacted in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made significant changes to U.S. tax laws. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (i) eliminated the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (ii) imposed new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, (iii) eliminated the exception under Section 162(m) for qualified performance-based compensation and (iv) provided for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and natural gas companies. While past legislative proposals have included changes to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas companies, including (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures, these specific changes are not included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d). No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. This legislation or any future similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and production.\nOur ability to deduct interest expense incurred in our business may be limited.\nIn general, we are entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \u201cbusiness interest\u201d is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income.\u201d For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion to the extent such depreciation, amortization, or depletion is not capitalized into cost of goods sold with respect to inventory.\nOur ability to deduct compensation paid to certain employees may be limited.\nSection 162(m) of the Code limits our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to covered employees (i.e., individuals currently serving or who have previously served, at any point after December 31, 2016, as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the three other highest compensated officers of the Company). Previously, Section 162(m) provided an exception for certain qualified performance-based compensation; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates this exception (other than for compensation provided under certain grandfathered arrangements), and as a result, our ability to deduct certain amounts paid to our covered employees may be limited.\nLegal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations.\nMost oil and natural gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, environmental or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters, if appropriate.\nBecause we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations, damage to our properties and/or injuries. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Strategic Value Partners LLC (\u201cSVP\u201d) and DW Partners, LP (\u201cDW\u201d) currently own approximately 37.9% and 15.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. SVP currently has a right to nominate two of our directors under our director nominating agreement described below. DW, together with other former noteholders who received our common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization, collectively hold the current right to nominate two additional directors. Our current board is limited to seven directors under the terms of the director nomination agreement. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during 2019 and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2019, we identified and disclosed a material weakness related to the design and operation of the controls over our income tax accounting process related to the review and analysis of the allocation of intra-period adjustments to deferred income tax expense resulting from significant, unusual and infrequent transactions. To remediate the material weakness, we redesigned and expanded our management review controls and enhanced the precision of review around the key income tax areas relating to the allocation of intra-period adjustments to deferred income tax expense. Based on testing performed by management, the implemented controls are operating effectively and the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2019.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our\nability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nA small number of institutional investors controls a significant percentage of our voting power and possess negative control or veto rights with respect to certain proposed Company transactions.\nA small group of institutional investors, who are parties to our director nomination agreement currently, beneficially own a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock. Consequently, such investors are able to strongly influence all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, changes to our organizational documents and approval of acquisition offers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership limits our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. In addition, the institutional holders that are parties to the director nomination agreement possess negative control or veto rights under the Company\u2019s First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d)with respect to certain transactions the Company may propose to undertake for so long as such parties collectively hold 50% or more of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Such parties are entitled to notice of certain proposed transactions which may be vetoed if such parties who collectively hold at least 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock object to such action. These veto rights of the parties to the director nomination agreement apply to the following transactions:\n\u2022\nthe sale or other disposition of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, with a fair market value in the aggregate in excess of $75 million, other than certain intercompany ordinary course transactions;\n\u2022\nany sale, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, bankruptcy event, reorganization, consolidation, or merger of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissuing or repurchasing any shares of our common stock or other equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) in an amount that is in the aggregate in excess of $5 million, other than pursuant to employee benefit and incentive plans (including certain repurchases of capital stock to satisfy withholding or similar taxes in connection with any exercise of equity rights) and the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants;\n\u2022\nincurring any indebtedness for borrowed money (including through capital leases, the issuance of debt securities or the guarantee of indebtedness of another person or entity), in any single transaction or series of related transactions, that is in the aggregate in excess of $75 million other than indebtedness incurred to refinance indebtedness issued for less than $75 million, intercompany indebtedness, and certain other obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nentering into any proposed transaction or series of related transactions involving a Change of Control of the Company (for purposes of this provision, \u201cChange of Control\u201d shall mean any transaction resulting in any person or group (as such terms are defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) acquiring \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of the total outstanding equity interests of the Company (measured by voting power rather than number of shares));\n\u2022\nentering into or consummating any material acquisition of businesses, companies or assets (whether through sales or leases) or joint ventures, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, in the aggregate in excess of $75 million;\n\u2022\nincreasing or decreasing the size of the Board;\n\u2022\namending the Charter or the First Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (\u201cBylaws\u201d); or\n\u2022\nentering into any arrangements or transactions with affiliates of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Charter and Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors\u037e\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide SVP and certain other institutional stockholders the right to nominate up to four of our directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide veto rights to certain stockholders as detailed in our Charter, including any transaction that may constitute a change of control, as defined in the Charter.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Charter or our Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nThe exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation or similar governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable, including with respect to claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 66739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SBOW"}
