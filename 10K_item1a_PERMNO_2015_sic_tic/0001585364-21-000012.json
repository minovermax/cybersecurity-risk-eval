RISK FACTORS\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOperational Risks\n\u2022We face vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, which may threaten the demand for and pricing of our products.\n\u2022If we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market innovative products, introduce new line extensions, and expand into adjacent categories that meet customer demands, our net sales may be negatively impacted and we may lose market share.\n\u2022We operate in highly regulated industries, and any inability to timely meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022Limitations on reimbursement, continuing healthcare reforms, and changes to reimbursement methods in the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Lack of availability, or significant increases in the cost, of raw materials used in manufacturing our products could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and operating results.\n\u2022The COVID-19 global pandemic and the public health and governmental actions in response could continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition in the future.\n\u2022A disruption at any of our main manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\n\u2022Our business could be negatively affected by the performance of our collaboration partners and suppliers, and any such adverse impact could be material.\n\u2022Our business depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of our sales, therefore our business would be adversely affected by a disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' businesses. The risk of such impacts would be increased by continued consolidation in the sectors in which our customers operate.\n\u2022Our businesses could be adversely affected by deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, and our results may be volatile due to these or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\u2022A cyber security breach, disruption or misuse of our information systems, or our external business partners\u2019 information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022We are dependent on the services of certain key personnel.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022We may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\u2022We have acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject us to losses and may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that our strategic initiatives will achieve their intended effects.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nGlobal Risks\n\u2022Our business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\n\u2022We operate in jurisdictions that could be affected by economic and political instability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022The international scope of our business exposes us to risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nLitigation and Insurance Risks\n\u2022We are or may become involved in lawsuits and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings.\n\u2022Increased scrutiny on pricing practices and competition in the pharmaceutical industry, including antitrust enforcement activity by government agencies and class action litigation, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Third-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit our ability to bring new products to market and may subject us to potential legal liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022The success of certain of our products depends on the effectiveness of measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights and patents.\n\u2022Our ability to achieve operating results in line with published guidance is inherently subject to numerous risks and other factors beyond our control. Publishing earnings guidance subjects us to risks, including increased stock volatility, that could lead to potential lawsuits by investors.\n\u2022Significant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of the insurance we maintain could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nTax Related Risks\n\u2022The resolution of uncertain tax positions, including the Notices of Proposed Adjustments and Notice of Assessment, could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Changes to tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\n\u2022Our effective tax rate or cash tax payment requirements may change in the future, which could adversely impact our future results of operations.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\n\u2022Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic initiatives.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee that we will buy back our ordinary shares pursuant to our announced share repurchase plan or that our share repurchase plan will enhance long-term shareholder value.\n\u2022Any additional shares we may issue could dilute your ownership in the Company.\n\u2022We are incorporated in Ireland; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\n\u2022We may be limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future.\nOperational Risks\nWe face vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, which may threaten the demand for and pricing of our products.\nOur products compete against store brand, generic, and branded health and wellness products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business may lose customers or face negative pricing pressures. In particular:\n\u2022Our CSCA, CSCI and RX segments each experience direct competition from other drug companies, including brand name companies, that may try to prevent, discourage or delay the use of our products through various measures, including introduction of new products, legislative initiatives, changing dosage forms or dosing regimens, regulatory processes, filing new patents or patent extensions, lawsuits, citizens\u2019 petitions, and attempts to generate negative publicity prior to our introduction of a new competitive product. Moreover, other companies may produce the same products as us, sometimes sold at dramatically lower margins in order to gain market share. Other companies may also introduce new drugs or drug delivery techniques that make our current products less desirable. In addition, in the RX segment, competitors may lower their prices to compete with generic products, increase advertising, or launch an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched, depriving the generic product of potential market exclusivity.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022The FDA's increasing acceptance of in vitro studies, rather than human clinical studies, to support bioequivalence of generic products may lead to increased production of products that compete with Perrigo's generic product portfolio.\n\u2022Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements or develop products comparable or superior to those offered by us at more competitive prices.\n\u2022Competition in the pharmaceutical space may also be impacted by changes in regulations and government pricing programs that may give certain competitors an advantage.\nIf we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market innovative products, introduce new line extensions, and expand into adjacent categories that meet customer demands, our net sales may be negatively impacted and we may lose market share.\nThe growth of our business is due in large part to our ability to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer requirements for quality, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Margins for existing products tend to decline over time due to aging product life cycles, changes in consumer preferences, pricing pressure from customers, and increased competition. Accordingly, our business model relies heavily on the continuous introduction of innovative products and new product categories. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market new products, or if we fail to stay current with the latest manufacturing information, and packaging technology, we could lose market share, and our net sales may be negatively affected.\nThe development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time consuming and costly, and subject to a high degree of business risk. Products currently under development may require re-design to meet evolving regulatory standards, may not perform as expected, may not pass required bioequivalence studies, or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges. Necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. Even if we are successful in developing a product, our customers' failure to launch one of our products successfully, or delays in manufacturing developed products, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose higher standards or additional requirements, as a condition to clearing new products, such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required, which could negatively impact our net sales. In our CSCA and RX segments, we must prove that the regulated generic drug products in these segments are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts, which may require bioequivalence studies, and, in the case of topical products, even more extensive clinical endpoint trials to demonstrate their efficacy, and the failure to do so could also negatively impact our sales.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries, and any inability to timely meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries in numerous countries and are subject to the regulations of a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. agencies related to the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, import, export, advertising, and sale (including cost, pricing and reimbursement) of our products, as described in detail in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing. Changes in laws, regulations, and practices in the countries in which we operate, which may be impacted by political pressure and other factors outside of our control, may be difficult or expensive for us to comply with, could restrict or delay our ability to manufacture, distribute, sell or market our products, and may adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and financial condition or impose significant administrative burdens. Divergence in regulatory approach from country to country, and between the EU and individual member states, adds cost and complexity to the compliance framework; and differences in requirements and/or implementation dates in different jurisdictions may provide competitive advantages to manufacturers that operate in other locations. If our products fail to meet regulatory requirements, our sales may be adversely affected, we may incur fines and penalties, and our exposure to liability relating to product-based claims may increase. Below are some examples of ways in which regulatory risk may impact us:\n\u2022We must obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies in order to manufacture and sell our products in the regions in which we operate. Obtaining this approval can be time consuming and costly. When we submit an application for market authorization, there can be no assurance that the regulator will approve that application on a timely basis or at all.\n\u2022U.S. law encourages generic competition by providing eligibility for first generic marketing exclusivity if certain conditions are met. If we are granted generic exclusivity, the exclusivity may be shared with other generic companies, including authorized generics; or we may forfeit 180-day exclusivity if we fail to obtain\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nregulatory approval and begin marketing within the statutory requirements. If we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, thereby effectively delaying the launch of our product and/or possibly reducing our market share.\n\u2022Global regulatory agencies regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our third-party suppliers. The failure of one of these facilities to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to a breach of representations made to our customers, or to regulatory or government action against us related to the products made in that facility, including suspension of or delay in regulatory approvals and product seizure, injunction, recall, suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of licenses or other governmental penalties, or civil or criminal prosecution, which could result in increased cost, lost revenue, or reputational damage.\n\u2022In 2020, regulatory agencies globally, including the FDA and EMA, issued guidance on assessing and controlling nitrosamine impurities in medicine products. We are undertaking a review of our product portfolio in accordance with regulatory guidance to assess the risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities. Any finding of nitrosamine impurities exceeding levels set by regulatory authorities may require us to adopt modified product sourcing and/or manufacturing processes or to initiate product withdrawal.\n\u2022Rx-to-OTC switches are critical to our future growth. If regulatory agencies fail to approve Rx-to-OTC switches in new product categories or reassess the terms of existing OTC classifications, our growth prospects and product mix would be impaired. Further, regulatory agencies may reassess the terms of OTC classification if they perceive a shift in the previously assessed benefit/risk profile. Any such reassessment could lead to OTC products reverting to prescription.\n\u2022Our infant formula products may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the content of such products. If governments enhance regulations on the infant formula industry by, for example, requiring additional testing or compulsory batch-by-batch inspection, our sales and operating margins in this category could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The regulation of controlled substances and List I chemicals complicates our supply chain, and adverse regulatory actions may result in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution of our products, withdrawal of our products from the market, or other penalties. If we are unable to obtain necessary quotas for controlled substances and List I chemicals, we risk having delayed product launches or failing to meet commercial supply obligations.\n\u2022As described in Item 1. Government Regulation and Pricing, beginning on May 26, 2025, all medical devices sold in the EU will need to be approved under the MDR, with certain device categories requiring compliance sooner, and there is currently a shortage in the number of Notified Bodies authorized to carry out conformity assessments required thereunder. If we fail to secure a notified body certificate under MDR, this will impact our ability to keep our medical devices in the EU market. Moreover, the designation of a notified body certifying certain of our products expired during the pandemic-related deferral of the MDR regulations, and its designation status moving forward is unclear. While we do not expect a material impact on our business, there can be no assurances that our ability to sell these medical devices in the EU will not be interrupted, slowed or otherwise adversely affected.\nLimitations on reimbursement, continuing healthcare reforms, and changes to reimbursement methods in the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing healthcare expenditures have received considerable public attention in many of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers, have been focused on cost containment. In some markets in the EU and outside the U.S., the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs through legislative and regulatory efforts, as further described in Item 1. Business - Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation, which could place further pricing pressure on our products and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nFor Medicaid programs, many of our products are considered non-innovator products and therefore are subject to Medicaid federal upper limits (\"FUL\"). Our products generally are subject to state Medicaid program payment methodologies, and may be subject to reimbursement pressures, and in some cases, those pressures may result from practices outside of our control, including how our competitors price their equivalent products. State Medicaid programs are continuing to evaluate their payment methods, and we cannot predict how the FUL or state payment methodologies will affect our pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers may seek additional discounts in light of reimbursement changes in the future. We also cannot predict how the sharing of FUL data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace in the future.\nOur RX segment in particular could be materially adversely impacted by measures taken by governmental entities or private insurers to restrict patients' access to our products or increase pressure on drug pricing, including denial of price increases, prospective and retrospective price decreases, and increased mandatory discounts or rebates. These actions may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices or may reduce the ability of customers to pay for our products, which could materially negatively impact the RX segment's results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation, we have entered into various government drug pricing agreements with the U.S. government. By their nature, these programs require us to provide discounts and rebates and therefore reduce our net product revenue. Further, because the amounts of these discounts are based on our commercial sales practices and can be adversely affected by both significant discounts and price increases, any failure to maintain pricing practices that appropriately take into account these government pricing programs could have an adverse effect on our condition and results of operations. There are other inherent risks associated with participating in these programs, including the following:\n\u2022We are required to report pricing data to CMS, including AMP, on a monthly and quarterly basis and BP and ASP on a quarterly basis. We also are required to report quarterly and annual Non-FAMPs to the VA. If we fail timely to submit required information, make misrepresentations in pricing or product data, or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government as to certain pricing disclosures, we may be liable for substantial civil monetary penalties and subject to other enforcement actions, including possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs, and CMS may terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement.\n\u2022Under the 340B program, if we knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, including in connection with a failure to offer refunds following 340B ceiling price restatements, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties.\n\u2022If we inadvertently overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or TriCare Agreement, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in False Claims Act allegations or potential violations of other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responses to a government investigation or enforcement action, are expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u2022Pricing and rebate calculations are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary between products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that these reviews could result in challenges to our submissions. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by the government to be incomplete or incorrect, which could result in civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products. Negative consumer perception may arise from media reports, social media posts, product liability claims, regulatory investigations, or recalls affecting our products or our industry, any of which may reduce demand.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022Our products involve risks such as product contamination, spoilage, mislabeling, and tampering that could require us to recall one or more of our products. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses, delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products, or other governmental penalties.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee that counterfeiting, imitation or other tampering with our products will not occur or that we will be able to detect and resolve it, which could lead to death or injury of consumers and negatively impact our reputation.\n\u2022Our nutritional product category is subject to certain consumer preferences and health and nutrition-related concerns, including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies, which could change based on factors including increased promotion of the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula by private, public and government sources and changes in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the U.S. federal government through the Women, Infants and Children program which we do not participate in.\n\u2022Our CSCI segment's financial success is dependent on positive brand recognition, which results in part from large investments in marketing over a period of years. The success of our brands may suffer if we do not continue to invest in marketing, or if our marketing plans or product initiatives are unsuccessful. In addition, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of other products, potentially hurting our financial results.\n\u2022With respect to our powdered infant formula products, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw materials, the processing and packaging of food products, and the use and handling by consumers, hospital personnel, and healthcare professionals. If certain of our infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not under our control, our reputation and our infant formula product category sales could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022Negative social media posts or comments about us, store brands or generic pharmaceuticals, or our products could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Negative posts or comments about our products could result in increased pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, which may give rise to liability if we fail to fully comply with such requirements.\nLack of availability, or significant increases in the cost, of raw materials used in manufacturing our products could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to source many of our raw materials and to manufacture certain dosage forms that we distribute, such as inhalers and sterile injectables. See Item 1. Business - Materials Sourcing. Certain raw materials may experience rapid cost increases due to increased energy costs and other inflationary pressures, and this may have a material negative impact on our financial results, whether or not we are able to pass on such increases to our customers. We maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner, a particularly severe effect for higher volume or more profitable products. It can take substantial time and investment to qualify an alternative supplier or material sources and establish reliable supply. For example, starting in the second quarter of 2021, we anticipate a potential supply disruption of a generic prescription product manufactured by a third party, which disruption could adversely affect our ability to sell and ship the product to customers in a timely manner. While we have identified one or more potential alternative suppliers of the product, delays in qualifying such alternative supplier may result in a supply disruption for the duration of 2021 and re-establishment of reliable supply may not be achieved until 2022 and cannot be assured.\nWe maintain a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants, and toxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with raw materials, product manufacturing processes, or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs and lost revenue, harm our reputation, and may give rise to product liability litigation.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nChanges in regulation could impact the supply of the API and certain other raw materials used in our products. For example, the EU recently promulgated new standards requiring all API imported into the EU be certified as complying with Good Manufacturing Practices established by the EU. The regulations placed the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries, which led to an API supply shortage in Europe as certain governments were not willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. A shortage in API or other raw ingredients could cause us to have to cease manufacture of certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers who are unable to export. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nMoreover, our infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk, which is influenced by factors beyond our control including seasonal and environmental factors, governmental agricultural and environmental policy, and global demand. Due to these factors, we cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients to produce infant formula.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and the public health and governmental actions in response could continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition in the future.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues across the globe, the outbreak of the disease and the actions to slow its spread have had an adverse impact on our operations and affected product sales mix across all our segments, as described in Item 7 - Executive Overview - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, all of our segments experienced demand shifts for certain products that caused net sales to increase in certain product categories and decrease in other categories. We attribute these demand shifts to consumer and customer behavior surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement and social distancing restrictions put in place to combat spreading of the virus, such as travel bans, country lock-downs, and school closings, as well as mask mandates. We also believe that the social distancing measures and mask mandates contributed to the decline in total cough cold illnesses during the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a decline of net sales for cough cold products in our upper respiratory category. Going forward, the continued spread of the disease and the actions to slow it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, our supply chains and other operations, our results of operations, consumer demand for our products and our ability to access capital. The magnitude of any such adverse impacts are not determinable, but could be material, depending on: the duration, intensity, and continued spread of the disease, including the emergence of new strains of the virus; the duration of business closure and similar government orders, business reopening procedures and the public's willingness to adhere to suggested safety measures; the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of currently approved and potential future vaccines and their effectiveness against new strains of the virus; the severity and duration of any economic downturn resulting from the pandemic; the effectiveness of the Company's efforts at mitigation; and other factors, both known and unknown, many of which are likely to be outside our control. In addition, to the extent that any increased sales of our products during the initial stages of the outbreak may reflect \"pantry stocking\", consumer demand for such products in future periods may be correspondingly reduced. Further, lower consumer demand for cough cold products in all our segments and certain other self-care products in our CSCI segment may continue, and volume of U.S. prescriptions could decrease in our RX segment in future periods depending on the course of the pandemic and related responses to combat the virus. It is also possible that a change in the course of the pandemic may affect consumer demand for products in future periods in ways we do not currently anticipate.\nA disruption at any of our main manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are concentrated in a few locations. See Item 1. Business - Manufacturing and Distribution for more information. A significant disruption at one or more of these facilities, whether due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, intentional acts of vandalism, climate change, war, terrorism, insufficient quality, or pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, regulatory authorities routinely inspect all of our manufacturing facilities for current GMP compliance. While our manufacturing sites are current GMP compliant, if a regulatory authority were to identify serious adverse findings not corrected in follow up inspections, we may be required to issue product recalls, shutdown manufacturing facilities, and take other remedial actions. If any manufacturing facility were forced to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nOur business could be negatively affected by the performance of our collaboration partners and suppliers, and any such adverse impact could be material.\nWe have entered into strategic alliances with partners and suppliers to develop, manufacture, market and/or distribute certain products, or components of our products in various markets. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to these various collaborations. There is a risk that our investments in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns. While we believe our relationships with our partners and suppliers generally are successful, disputes, conflicting priorities or regulatory or legal intervention could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefit of the collaboration (refer to Item 8. Note 18). A failure or inability of our partners or suppliers to fulfill their collaboration obligations, or the occurrence of any of the risks above, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of our sales, therefore our business would be adversely affected by a disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' businesses. The risk of such impacts would be increased by continued consolidation in the sector in which our customers operate.\nSales to our largest customer, Walmart, comprised approximately 13.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. While no other customer individually comprised more than 10% of net sales in 2020, our next five largest customers in 2020 represent 23.2% of net sales in the aggregate. If our relationship with Walmart or any of our other significant customers, including the terms of doing business with the customers, changes significantly, it could have a material adverse impact on us (refer to Item 1. Business - Significant Customers).\nMany of our customers continue to merge or consolidate, which has provided, and may continue to provide, customers with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures we face. The emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. In addition, several of our customers have instituted sourcing programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer. These developments have resulted in heightened pricing pressure on our products, as well as competition among generic drug producers for business from a smaller and more selective customer base.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, customers may choose to assess penalties (where such penalties are contractually permitted), obtain alternate sources for products, and/or end their relationships with us.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, and our results may be volatile due to these or other circumstances beyond our control.\nOur customers could be adversely impacted if economic conditions worsen in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate. In the U.S., our consumer self-care business does not advertise our store brand products like national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share. If our customers do not have the ability to invest in store brand promotional activities, our sales may suffer. Additionally, while we actively review the credit worthiness of our customers and suppliers, we cannot fully predict to what extent they may be negatively impacted by slowing economic growth. Our stock price may decline due to any earnings release or guidance that does not meet market expectations or other circumstances beyond our control, such as the severity, length and timing of the cough/cold/flu and allergy seasons, the timing of new product approvals and introductions by us and our competitors, and the timing of retailer promotional programs.\nA cyber security breach, disruption or misuse of our information systems, or our external business partners\u2019 information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business operations are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems that are highly complex, interrelated with our external business partners, and may contain confidential information (including personal data, trade secrets or other intellectual property, or proprietary business information). The nature of digital systems, both internally and externally, makes them potentially vulnerable to disruption or damage from human error and/or security breaches, which include, but are not limited to, ransomware, data theft, denial of service attacks, sabotage, industrial espionage, interruptions or other system issues, unauthorized access and computer\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nviruses. Such events may be difficult to detect, and once detected, their impact may be difficult to assess and address.\nCyber-attacks have become increasingly common. We have experienced immaterial business disruption and data loss as a result of phishing, business email compromise and other types of attacks. While we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient, and that could subject us to significant risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022Ransomware attacks, other cyber breaches or disruptions that impair our ability to develop products, meet regulatory approval requirements or deadlines, produce or ship products, take or fulfill orders, and/or collect or make payments on a timely basis;\n\u2022System issues, whether as a result of an intentional breach, a natural disaster or human error that damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower sales volume, and/or incur significant liabilities;\n\u2022Significant expense to remediate the results of any attack or breach and to ensure compliance with any required disclosures mandated by the numerous global privacy and security laws and regulations; and\n\u2022Interruptions, security breaches, or loss, misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of confidential information,\nwhich, individually or collectively, could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act in the U.S. and the European Global Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). These data protection laws introduced more stringent data protection requirements and significant potential fines, as well as increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process and possess. We have put mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws but there can be no guarantee of their effectiveness.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key personnel.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key personnel, and our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Key functions for us include executive managers, operational managers, R&D scientists, information technology specialists, financial and legal specialists, regulatory professionals, quality compliance specialists, and sales/marketing personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain key qualified employees, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, some of which may be significant in size or impact. Transactions of this nature create substantial demands on management, operational resources, technology, and financial and internal control systems, and can be subject to government approvals or other closing conditions beyond the parties' control. In the case of acquisitions, we may face difficulties with integrating these businesses, managing expanded operations, achieving operating or financial synergies in expected timeframes or in new products or geographic markets. In the case of divestitures, including the planned separation of the RX business, we may face difficulty in effectively transferring contracts, obligations, facilities, and personnel to the purchaser, while minimizing continued exposure to risks and liabilities of the divested business.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in identifying and assessing the value, strengths, and profit potential, as well as the weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities of acquisition targets, which can be affected by changes in business, industry, market or general economic conditions. Moreover, the financing of any acquisition can have a material impact on our liquidity, credit ratings and financial position. Alternatively, issuing equity to pay all or a portion of acquisition purchase price would dilute our existing shareholders.\nOn March 1, 2021, we announced the sale of our generic RX Pharmaceuticals business to Altaris Capital Partners, LLC for total consideration of $1.55 billion. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nincluding certain antitrust approvals, and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2021. The sale of the generic RX Pharmaceuticals business is an important step in our transformation plan and will establish Perrigo as a \u201cpure-play\u201d consumer self-care company, enabling us to concentrate on our worldwide consumer self-care products businesses. However, the sale of the generic RX Pharmaceuticals business could impact our ability to retain key employees, comply with existing debt arrangements, maintain our credit ratings and raise future capital. Further, even if the sale is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated operational, financial, strategic or other benefits therefrom. There can be no assurances that a sale or separation of the generic RX Pharmaceuticals business will achieve our intended goals or that the transformation of Perrigo to a \u201cpure-play\u201d consumer self-care products company will receive the level of market support that we expect, within any specific timeframe. Moreover, after the closing, our business will be less diversified with a narrower focus which could make us more susceptible to changing market conditions or result in increased volatility in our stock price.\nAcquisitions and divestitures, including the generic RX Pharmaceuticals business, also involve costs, including fees and expenses of financial advisors, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals, and can involve retention bonuses and other additional compensation of employees or increase turnover in personnel. Any of these risks or expenses could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject us to losses and may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of previous acquisitions, which could become impaired and lead to material charges in the future. Refer to Item 8. Note 4.\nWe perform an impairment analysis on intangible assets subject to amortization when there is an indication that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. Goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible asset, and definite-lived intangible asset impairments are recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the net book value of our goodwill and intangible assets were $3.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. In the past three years, we have recognized a total of $755.7 million in asset impairments, across all segments and asset categories (refer to Item 8. Note 4).\nThere can be no assurance that our strategic initiatives will achieve their intended effects.\nWe are in the process of implementing certain initiatives designed to increase operational efficiency and improve our return on invested capital by globalizing our supply chain through global shared service arrangements, streamlining our organizational structure, making key executive employee changes, performing a strategic portfolio review, and disposing of certain assets. Furthermore, we are transitioning into a consumer-focused, self-care company. We believe these initiatives will enhance our net sales, operating margins, and earnings; however, certain of these initiatives require substantial upfront costs, and there can be no assurance any of these initiatives will produce the anticipated benefits. Any delay or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our projected results.\nGlobal Risks\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\nWe manufacture, source raw materials, and sell our products in a number of countries. The percentage of our business outside the U.S. has been increasing. We are subject to risks associated with international manufacturing and sales, including: changes in regulatory requirements (see Item 1. Business - Government Regulations and Pricing, changes to tax and import/export laws and trade and customs policies (including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including but not limited to, goods imported from China), problems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems, possible difficulties in enforcing agreements, longer payment cycles and shipping lead-times, difficulties obtaining export or import licenses, and imposition of withholding or other taxes.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import and export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties, and increased duties.\nCertain of our facilities operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board, which allows us certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities. If the Foreign Trade Zone Board were to revoke the sub-zone designation or limit our use, we could be subject to increased duties.\nAlthough we believe that we conduct our business in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and economic sanctions laws, if we are found to not be in compliance with such laws or other anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties. This risk increases in locations outside of the U.S., particularly in locations that have not previously had to comply with the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act 2010, Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, and similar laws.\nWe operate in jurisdictions that could be affected by economic and political instability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations and supply partners could be affected by economic or political instability, embargoes, military hostilities, unstable governments and legal systems, and inter-governmental disputes as well as travel restrictions, terrorist acts, and other armed conflicts. The global nature of our business involves the following risks, among others:\n\u2022Our facilities in Israel are within a conflict zone. If terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to our facilities, our business activities would be disrupted since, with respect to most products, we would need to obtain prior regulatory agency approval for a change in manufacturing site. Moreover, certain countries and international organizations have refused to do business with companies with Israeli operations. We are also precluded from marketing our products to certain countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions.\n\u2022The U.S. Department of State and other governments have at times issued advisories regarding travel to certain countries in which we do business, causing regulatory agencies to curtail or prohibit their inspectors from traveling to inspect facilities. If these inspectors are unable to inspect our facilities, the regulatory agencies could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities.\n\u2022On June 23, 2016, the UK electorate voted in a referendum to voluntarily depart from the EU, known as \"Brexit\". Following the formation of a majority Conservative government in December 2019, the UK approved the withdrawal agreement and left the EU on January 31, 2020. The UK remained in the EU customs union and the single market for a transition period that expired on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the EU reached agreement in principle on their future trading relationship and entered into the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which applies provisionally until February 28, 2021, by which stage it is expected to be formally ratified by the parties and fully in force. The agreement provides for free trade in goods and limited mutual market access in services, as well as for cooperation mechanisms in a range of policy areas and UK participation in some EU programs. However, significant political and economic uncertainty remains as to aspects of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Future trading terms between the UK and other trading partners, including the United States, are also unknown. Brexit has created significant instability and volatility in the global financial markets, has led to significant weakening of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and could still adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions. Although the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is temporarily in place, the full extent of any disruption on imports and exports, for example relating to increased regulatory complexities, is unknown. These complexities may impair the ability of our operations in the EU to transact business in the future in the UK, and similarly the ability of our UK operations to transact business in the future in the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of the above mentioned effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, operations, and financial results.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nThe international scope of our business exposes us to risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities, and costs are denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies include, among others, the Euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Canadian dollar, Israeli shekel, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso. Our Branded Consumer Self-care business is a euro-denominated business that represents a significant portion of our net sales, net earnings and net assets. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have positive or negative impacts on our operating results and/or cash flows. We may seek to mitigate the risk of such impacts through hedging, but such hedging activities may be costly and may not be effective.\nIn addition, emerging market economies in which we operate may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, weaker oil and other commodity prices, and large external deficits. Risks in one country can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in another country or countries. Such conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risks in some of those markets.\nLitigation and Insurance Risks\nWe are or may become involved in lawsuits and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits arising from a wide variety of commercial, manufacturing, development, marketing, sales and other business-related matters, including, but not limited to, competitive issues, pricing, contract issues, intellectual property matters, false advertising, antitrust or unfair competition, taxation matters, workers' compensation, product quality/recall, environmental remediation, securities law, disclosure, and regulatory issues. Litigation is unpredictable and could result in potentially significant monetary damages, and we could incur substantial legal expenses, even if a claim against us is unsuccessful. We intend to vigorously defend against any lawsuits, however, we cannot predict how the cases will be resolved. Adverse results in, or settlements of, such cases could result in substantial monetary judgments. No assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position or results of operations in the future (refer to Item 8. Note 17).\nThe actual or alleged presence of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under or in our currently or formerly owned property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, or the failure to remediate them, could have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on our ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on us. See Item 1. Business - Information Applicable to All Reportable Segments - Environmental for more information related to environmental remediation matters.\nIncreased scrutiny on pricing practices and competition in the pharmaceutical industry, including antitrust enforcement activity by government agencies and class action litigation, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere has been increased scrutiny regarding sales, marketing, and pricing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including criminal antitrust investigations regarding drug pricing, civil False Claims Act investigations relating to drug pricing and marketing, multiple civil antitrust litigation initiated by governmental and private plaintiffs against pharmaceutical manufacturers and individuals, and related media reports.\nOn May 2, 2017, we disclosed that search warrants were executed at several Perrigo facilities and other locations in connection with the Antitrust Division\u2019s ongoing investigation related to drug pricing in the pharmaceutical industry. Perrigo has also been served with and responded to a civil investigative demand in connection with a related civil False Claims Act investigation by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. Although no charges or other related civil claims have been brought to date against Perrigo or any of our current employees (or, to the best of our knowledge, former employees), by the Department of Justice, we take the investigation very seriously.\nIf criminal antitrust charges are filed involving Perrigo, we would incur substantial litigation and other costs, and could face substantial monetary penalties, injunctive relief, negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nRegardless of the ultimate outcome, responding to those charges would divert management\u2019s time and attention and could impair our operations. Further, we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory changes may result from the ongoing public scrutiny of our industry, what the nature of any such changes might be, or what impact they may have on Perrigo. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation. While we intend to defend Perrigo's conduct at issue in these investigations vigorously, any adverse decision could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nIn addition, we have been named as a co-defendant with certain other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in a number of class action, individual plaintiff direct action, State Attorney General, and county lawsuits alleging that we engaged in anti-competitive behavior to fix or raise the prices of certain drugs starting, in some instances, as early as calendar year 2010 (refer to Item 8. Note 17). While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, any adverse decision could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nThird-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit our ability to bring new products to market and may subject us to potential legal liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u2022As a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, the ability of our CSCA, CSCI, and RX segments to bring new products to market is often limited by third-party patents or proprietary rights and regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products. Launching new products prior to resolution of intellectual property issues may result in us incurring legal liability if the related litigation is later resolved against us. The cost and time for us to develop prescription and Rx-to-OTC switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that we introduce. Any failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner could cause us to lose market share, and our operating results could suffer.\n\u2022We could have to defend against charges that we infringed patents or violated proprietary rights of third parties. This could require us to incur substantial expense and could divert significant effort of our technical and management personnel. If we are found to have infringed rights of others, we could lose our right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Additionally, if we choose to settle a dispute through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products.\n\u2022At times, our CSCA or RX segments may seek approval to market drug products before the expiration of a third party's patents for therapeutically-equivalent products, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. In these cases, we may face significant patent litigation. Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, we may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a store brand or generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending, before any court decision, or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending, known as an \"at risk\" launch. The risk involved in an \"at risk\" launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails, the remedies available to the patent holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the holder, which are often significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. By electing to proceed in this manner, we could face substantial damages if we receive an adverse final court decision. In the case where a patent holder is able to prove that our infringement was \"willful\" or \"exceptional,\" under applicable law, the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages or we may be required to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe success of certain of our products depends on the effectiveness of measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights and patents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may manufacture and market similar products.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022We have been issued patents covering certain of our products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries. Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide us with any significant competitive advantages for our products or may even be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by competitors. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using, or commercializing non-infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\n\u2022We also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to achieve operating results in line with published guidance is inherently subject to numerous risks and other factors beyond our control. Publishing earnings guidance subjects us to risks, including increased stock volatility, that could lead to potential lawsuits by investors.\nBecause we publish earnings guidance, we are subject to several risks. Earnings guidance is inherently uncertain and subject to factors beyond our control. Actual results may vary from the guidance we provide investors from time to time, such that our stock price may decline following, among other things, any earnings release or guidance that does not meet market expectations.\nIt has become increasingly commonplace for investors to file lawsuits against companies following a rapid decrease in market capitalization. We have been in the past, are currently, and may be in the future, named in these types of lawsuits. These types of lawsuits can be costly and divert management attention and other resources away from our business, regardless of their merits, and could result in adverse settlements or judgments. The inherent uncertainty of earnings guidance and related lawsuits could have a material impact on the Company.\nSignificant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of the insurance we maintain could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nTo protect the Company against various potential liabilities, we maintain a variety of insurance programs, including property, general, product, and directors' and officers' liability. We may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that we purchase. Insurance costs, including deductible or retention amounts, may increase, or our coverage could be reduced, which could lead to an adverse effect on our financial results depending on the nature of a loss and the level of insurance coverage we maintained. Moreover, we are self-insured when insurance is not available, not offered at economically reasonable premiums or does not adequately cover claims brought against us. Our business inherently exposes us to claims, and an unanticipated payment of a large claim may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax Related Risks\nThe resolution of uncertain tax positions, including the Notices of Proposed Adjustments and Notice of Assessment, could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and our tax filings are prepared in accordance with applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit or any related litigation could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made and in future periods after the determination. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties or interest assessments.\nWe are currently involved in several audits and adjustment-related disputes and related litigation, including the NoA and NOPAs, as described more fully in Item 8. Note 15. Based on a review of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that these matters will not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, while we believe that our position in these matters is correct, there can be no assurance of ultimate favorable outcomes, and if one or more matters are ultimately resolved unfavorably it would have a material adverse impact on us, including a material adverse impact on our financial\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nposition, liquidity, capital resources, and strategy. In addition, an adverse result with respect to any of such matters could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay assessments and related interest, penalties, or other amounts, and any such use of corporate assets would limit the assets available for other corporate purposes. We will consider the financial statement impact of any additional facts as they become available.\nChanges to tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Refer to Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing.\nWe believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions. An unfavorable determination on Perrigo Company plc\u2019s treatment as a foreign corporation under section 7874 of the Code or changes to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance and legislative proposals aimed at expanding the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, which could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nAdditionally, we are subject to tax laws in various jurisdictions globally, Refer to Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing for a discussion of recent changes to U.S. and EU tax laws, including the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act in 2017, which includes the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") regulations. Any of these changes could have a prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, and affiliates, and could adversely affect us by changing our effective tax rate and limiting our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nOur effective tax rate or cash tax payment requirements may change in the future, which could adversely impact our future results of operations.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rate or cash tax payment requirements, which may impact our future results and cash flows from operations (refer to Item 8. Note 15). These factors include, but are not limited to: changes to income tax rates, to tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (including additional proposals for fundamental international tax reform globally); the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, treatment or characterization of intercompany transactions, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and divestitures of current operations.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic initiatives.\nOur business requires continuous capital investments, and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect the business. At December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness outstanding was $3.6 billion.\n\u2022Our senior credit facilities, the agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. These covenants include specified financial ratios and tests, which could affect our ability to operate our business or limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions. If we\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ndo not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable.\n\u2022A default under certain indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance our debt or obtain sufficient new financing.\n\u2022Downgrades to our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs on current or future financing, including via trade payables with vendors. Customers' inclination to purchase goods from us may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.\n\u2022There are various maturity dates associated with our credit facilities, senior notes, and other debt facilities. There is no assurance that cash, future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. Further, there is no assurance that any future refinancing or renegotiation of our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms (refer to Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).\nWe cannot guarantee that we will buy back our ordinary shares pursuant to our announced share repurchase plan or that our share repurchase plan will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nIn October 2018 our Board of Directors authorized up to $1.0 billion of share repurchases with no expiration date, subject to the Board of Directors\u2019 approval of the pricing parameters and amount that may be repurchased. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of 3.4 million of our ordinary shares under such authorization at an average purchase price of $48.28 per share. The specific timing and amount of additional buybacks under the authorization, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our ordinary shares, the nature of other investment opportunities and the availability of our distributable reserves. Buybacks of our ordinary shares could affect the market price of our ordinary shares, increase their volatility or diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase plan is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so, and short-term share price fluctuations could reduce the plan\u2019s effectiveness.\nAny additional shares we may issue could dilute your ownership in the Company.\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\nSubject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of a special resolution. Such disapplication of these preemption rights can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares.\nAt our annual general meeting of shareholders in May 2020, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to a maximum of 33% of our issued ordinary capital on that date for a period of 18 months from the passing of the resolution. At the annual general meeting, our shareholders also authorized our Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares on a nonpreemptive basis in the following circumstances: (i) an issuance of shares in connection with any rights issuance and (ii) an issuance of shares for cash, if the issuance is limited to up to 5% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital (with the possibility of issuing an additional 5% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital provided the Company uses it only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment that is announced contemporaneously with the issuance, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issuance), bringing the total acceptable limit for nonpreemptive share issuances for cash to 10% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe are incorporated in Ireland; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the \"Act\"). The Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors.\n\u2022Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company for the breach of such duties, except in limited circumstances.\n\u2022Shareholders may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax, Irish income tax, and capital acquisitions tax.\n\u2022There is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Before a foreign judgment would be deemed enforceable in Ireland, the judgment must be (i) for a definite sum, (ii) provided by a court of competent jurisdiction and (iii) final and conclusive. An Irish High Court may exercise its right to refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if it violated Irish public policy, if it is in breach of natural justice, or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment.\n\u2022An Irish High Court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish High Courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.\n\u2022It could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction than if we were a U.S. company because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law.\n\u2022Additionally, under the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules, 2013, the Board of Directors is not permitted to take any action that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares, including issuing additional ordinary shares or convertible equity, making material acquisitions or dispositions, or entering into contracts outside the ordinary course of business, once the Board of Directors has received an approach that may lead to an offer or has reason to believe that such an offer is or may be imminent, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions may give the Board of Directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors and protect the interests of holders of ordinary shares than would be the case for a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nWe may be limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future.\nA number of factors may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future, including, among other things:\n\u2022Our ability to receive cash dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022Compliance with applicable laws and debt covenants;\n\u2022Our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant; and\n\u2022The availability of our distributable reserves, being profits of the company available for distribution to shareholders.\nUnder Irish law, distributable reserves are the accumulated realized profits so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less accumulated realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or a reorganization of capital duly made. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made if, at the time of the distribution or dividend, our net assets are not, or would not be, after giving effect to such distribution or dividend, be equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of our called-up share capital plus undistributable reserves.\nWhile we currently expect to continue paying dividends and operating our share repurchase plan, significant changes in our business or financial condition such as asset impairments, sustained operating losses and the selling of assets, could impact the amount of distributable reserves available to us. We could seek to create additional distributable reserves through a reduction in our share premium, which would require 75% shareholder approval and the approval of the Irish High Court. The Irish High Court's approval is a matter for the discretion of the\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ncourt, and there can be no assurances that such approval would be obtained. In the event that additional distributable reserves are not created in this way, dividends, share repurchases or other distributions would generally not be permitted under Irish law until such time as we have created sufficient distributable reserves in our audited statutory financial statements as a result of our business activities.", "PERMNO": 77182, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRGO"}
