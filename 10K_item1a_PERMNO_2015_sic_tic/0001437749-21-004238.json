The outbreak has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, including, among others, restrictions on travel, manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the world, and the imposition of remote or work-from-home mandates in many of our offices, including in the United States, the Philippines and, for a time, China. The majority of our products are manufactured, assembled, and tested by third parties in Asia. In addition, we rely on third party vendors for certain logistics and shipping operations throughout the world, including in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. We also have other operations in China, the Philippines, and the United States. If the remote or work-from-home conditions in any of our offices continue for an extended period of time, we may experience delays in product development, a decreased ability to support our customers, reduced design win activity, and overall lack of productivity.\nPandemics and epidemics such as the current COVID-19 outbreak or other widespread public health problems could negatively impact our business. If, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to progress in ways that significantly disrupt the manufacture, shipment, and buying patterns of our products or the products of our customers, this may materially negatively impact our operating results, including revenue, gross margins, operating margins, cash flows and other operating results, and our overall business. Our customers may also experience closures of their manufacturing facilities or inability to obtain other components, either of which could negatively impact demand for our solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the overall economy and, as a result of the foregoing, could negatively impact our operating results and may do so in a material way. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase or change the severity of our other risks reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including that:\n\u25cf Our subcontractor suppliers who manufacture silicon wafers, packaging and testing to deliver our semiconductor products may be unable to meet delivery expectations to meet customer demand;\n\u25cf Our distributors and customers may experience adverse performance and any reduction in the use of our products by our end customers could harm our sales and significantly decrease our revenue;\n\u25cf The semiconductor industry could experience a cyclical downturn, which could cause a meaningful reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results;\n\u25cf Countries may adopt tariffs and trade sanctions or similar actions;\n\u25cf We may be delayed in our development and introduction of new products that achieve customer and market acceptance;\n\u25cf Our operations may be disrupted if employees are unavailable due to illness, risk of illness, travel restrictions, work from home requirements, or other factors that may limit our access to key personnel or critical skills, or reduce productivity;\n\u25cf Shortages in or increased costs for silicon wafers, packaging materials, testing and shipping could adversely impact our gross margin and lead to reduced revenue;\n\u25cf We may experience difficulty in maintaining the uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems, or be exposed to increased risk of a cyber-security incident or fraud, due to an increased reliance on remote work;\n\u25cf We may incur impairments of goodwill and otherwise as required under U.S. GAAP;\n\u25cf Our outstanding indebtedness could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may exacerbate the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or cause them to change in importance. Developments related to the pandemic and to vaccine rollout have been rapidly changing, and additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to appropriately respond to currently. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business, and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. As of the filing of this Annual Report, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our business is highly uncertain and dependent on future developments that are inherently unpredictable, which makes forecasting demand and providing guidance especially difficult. Accordingly, our expectations are subject to change without warning and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.\nOur global business operations expose us to various economic, legal, regulatory, political, and business risks, which could impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have significant domestic and international operations. Our international operations include foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, which account for the majority of our revenue, and operational and research and development sites in China, the Philippines, and other Asian locations. In addition, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries; have our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside of the United States; and rely on an international service provider for inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics.\nOur domestic and international business activities are subject to economic, political and regulatory risks, including volatility in the financial markets; fluctuations in consumer liquidity; changes in interest rates; price increases for materials and components; trade barriers or changes in trade policies; political instability; acts of war or terrorism; natural disasters; economic sanctions; weak economic conditions, environmental regulations; labor regulations; import and export regulations; tax or freight rates; duties; trade restrictions; interruptions in transportation or infrastructure; anti-corruption laws; domestic and foreign governmental regulations; potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for intellectual property; disruptions or delays in production or shipments; and instability or fluctuations in currency exchange rates, any of which could lead to decreased demand for our products or a change in our results of operation. Uncertainty about future political and economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations to which we are subject, both within the United States and internationally, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, which could harm our business and financial results. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and non-compliance monetary penalties of up to the higher of 20 million Euros or 4% of worldwide revenue. California also recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which imposes significant fines and penalties for violations. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately comply with applicable laws or regulations, including GDPR or CCPA, could result in additional cost and liability to our business and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince late 2019, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, prompting precautionary government-imposed closures of certain travel and business. The operations of customers and the Company may be affected by this and similar public health matters. Although our supply chain does not appear to be affected by this epidemic, it may lead to events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could suffer as a result of tariffs and trade sanctions or similar actions.\nThe imposition by the United States of tariffs, sanctions or other restrictions on goods imported from outside of the United States or countermeasures imposed in response to such government actions could adversely affect our operations or our ability to sell our products globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The materials subject to these tariffs may impact the cost of raw materials used by our suppliers or in our customers\u2019 products. The imposition of further tariffs by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken in response to additional tariffs, could increase costs in our supply chain or reduce demand of our customers\u2019 products, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers or suppliers could also become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions. For example, in 2019 the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against one of our customers in China and imposed a licensing requirement on this customer with a policy of denial for some items, which has limited our ability to do business with this customer. In 2020, the U.S. imposed additional regulatory restrictions on the sale of U.S. controlled technology to customers in China, including establishing additional licensing requirements for the sale of U.S.-originated technology for certain applications or to companies that participate in the Chinese national security supply chain and limiting the fabrication of devices for certain Chinese companies where U.S. technology is involved in the fabrication process. Furthermore, in August 2020 the U.S. established additional licensing requirements for one of our China customers and its affiliates that limit any sales of products to that customer or for that customer\u2019s products absent a license. The U.S. government may add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or impose additional licensing requirements that we may be unable to meet in a timely manner or at all. Where license requirements are imposed, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will grant licenses to permit the continuation of business with these customers. Future sanctions similar to those imposed in the past and to those recently imposed could adversely affect our ability to earn revenue from these and similar customers. In addition, the imposition of sanctions on customers in China may cause those customers to seek domestic alternatives to our products and those of other United States semiconductor companies. Further, the Chinese government has indicated its intention to develop an unreliable entity list, which may limit the ability of companies on the list to engage in business with Chinese customers. We cannot predict what impact these and future actions, sanctions or criminal charges could have on our customers or suppliers, and therefore our business. If any of our other customers or suppliers become subject to sanctions or other regulatory scrutiny, if our customers are affected by tariffs or other government trade restrictions, or if we become subject to retaliatory regulatory measures, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFactors Related to Manufacturing our Products\nWe rely on a concentrated number of subcontractors to supply and fabricate silicon wafers and to perform assembly and test operations for our semiconductor products. If they are unable to do so on a timely and cost-effective basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, we may incur significant costs or delays.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of independent foundries in Asia to supply and fabricate silicon wafers for our semiconductor products, including Samsung Semiconductor, United Microelectronics Corporation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Seiko Epson. Our success is dependent upon our ability to successfully partner with our foundry and OSAT partners and their ability to produce wafers and finished semiconductor products with competitive prices and performance attributes, including smaller process geometries. Establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry and OSAT relationships requires the investment of management resources and costs.\nIf we fail to maintain our foundry and OSAT relationships, if these partners do not provide facilities and support for our development efforts, if they are insolvent or experience financial difficulty, or if we elect or are required to change foundries or OSATs, we may incur significant costs and delays. If our foundry or OSAT partners are unable to, or do not, manufacture sufficient quantities of our products at acceptable yields, we may be required to allocate the affected products among our customers, prematurely limit or discontinue the sales of certain products, or incur significant costs to transfer products to other foundries or OSATs, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results.\nOur margins are dependent on our achieving continued yield improvement.\nWe rely on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining acceptable margins. To the extent such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or that our products do not achieve market acceptance or market acceptance at acceptable pricing, our forecasts of future revenue, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nShortages in, or increased costs of, wafers and materials could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.\nWorldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is relatively inelastic. If the demand for silicon wafers or assembly material exceeds market supply, our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited or prohibitively expensive. We typically have short-term wafer supply agreements that do not ensure long-term supply or allocation commitments. A shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand and therefore reduce our revenue. In addition, silicon wafers constitute a material portion of our product cost. If we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to warranty claims and other costs related to our products.\nIn general, we warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non-conformance to our specifications and certain other defects. Because our products, including hardware, software, and intellectual property cores, are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology, our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects, whether these are specific manufacturing defects affecting individual products or these are systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments. Inability to detect a defect could result in a diversion of our engineering resources from product development efforts, increased engineering expenses to remediate the defect, and increased costs due to customer accommodation or inventory impairment charges. On occasion, we have also repaired or replaced certain components, made software fixes, or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects. Our insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against these issues. If there are significant product defects, the costs to remediate such defects, net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors, if any, or to resolve warranty claims may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.\nA material change in the agreements governing encryption keys we use could place additional restrictions on us, or our distributors or contract manufacturers, which could restrict product shipment or significantly increase the cost to track products throughout the distribution chain.\nCertain components in our products contain encryption keys used in connection with High Definition Content Protection (\"HDCP\"). The regulation and distribution of these encryption keys are controlled through license agreements with Digital Content Protection (\"DCP\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation. These license agreements have been modified by DCP from time to time, and such changes could impact us, our distributors, and our customers. An important element of HDMI is the ability to implement link protection for HD, and more recently, 4K UltraHD, content. We implement various aspects of the HDCP link protection within certain parts we sell. We also, for the benefit of our customers, include the necessary HDCP encryption keys in parts we ship to customers. These encryption keys are provided to us from DCP. We have a specific process for tracking and handling these encryption keys. If DCP changes any of the tracking or handling requirements associated with HDCP encryption keys, we may be required to change our manufacturing and distribution processes, which could adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs associated with these products. If we cannot satisfy new requirements for the handling and tracking of encryption keys, we may have to cease shipping or manufacturing certain products.\nFactors Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation\nThe intellectual property licensing component of our business strategy increases our business risk and fluctuation of our revenue and margins.\nOur business strategy includes licensing our intellectual property to companies that incorporate it into their technologies that address multiple markets, including markets where we participate and compete. Our Licensing and services revenue may be impacted by the introduction of new technologies by customers in place of the technologies we license, changes in the law that may weaken our ability to prevent the use of our patented technology by others, the expiration of our patents, and changes of demand or selling prices for products using licensed patents. We cannot assure that our licensing customers will continue to license our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all, or that these customers will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology, accurately report royalties owed to us, pay agreed upon royalties, honor agreed upon market restrictions, or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property. Our intellectual property licensing agreements are complex and may depend upon many factors that require significant judgments, including completion of milestones, allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptance.\nOur sale of patents and intermittent significant licensing transactions can cause material fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins.\nWe have generated revenue from the sale of certain patents from our portfolio in the past, generally for non-core technology that we are no longer actively developing. While we plan to continue to monetize our patent portfolio through sales of non-core patents, we may not be able to realize adequate interest or prices for those patents. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to generate revenue from these sales. In addition, although we seek to be strategic in our decisions to sell patents, we might incur reputational harm if a purchaser of our patents sues one of our customers for infringement of the purchased patent, and we might later decide to enter a space that requires the use of one or more of the patents we sold. In addition, as we sell groups of patents, we no longer have the opportunity to further sell or to license those patents and receive a continuing royalty stream.\nOur Licensing and services revenue fluctuates, sometimes significantly, from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key transactions being completed in a given period, the timing of which is difficult to predict and may not match our expectations. Licensing and services revenue may include revenue from the sales of patents, which sales may be difficult to complete and which may have complex terms for the payment which affects revenue recognition. Because of its high margin, the Licensing and services revenue portion of our overall revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit and profitability. In addition, generating revenue from patent sales and intellectual property licenses is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which our efforts begin, and the accounting rules governing the recognition of revenue from patent sales and intellectual property licensing transactions are increasingly complex and require significant judgment. As a result, the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations.\nLitigation and unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims may not yet be resolved, including but not limited to any that are discussed under \"Note 14 - Contingencies\" contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit or outcome, claims or litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters or enter into a material settlement, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and certain portions of our business.\nOur participation in the HDMI standard is evolving. We no longer act as agent for the HDMI standard, and our share of adopter fees and royalties for the HDMI standard is subject to variability.\nWe acted as agent of the HDMI consortium until December 31, 2016 and were responsible for promoting and administering the specification. We received all of the adopter fees paid by adopters of the HDMI specification in connection with our role as agent. In September 2016, the Founders of the HDMI consortium, of which we are a member, amended the Founders Agreement resulting in changes to our role as agent for the HDMI consortium and to the model for sharing adopter fee revenues. Under the terms of the agreement, our role as the agent was terminated effective January 1, 2017 and a new independent entity was appointed to act as the new HDMI licensing agent with responsibility for licensing and the distribution of royalties among Founders. As a result of the amended model for sharing adopter fee revenue, we are entitled to a share of the adopter fees paid by parties adopting the HDMI standard.\nWe share HDMI royalties with the other HDMI Founders based on an allocation formula, which is reviewed generally every three years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the HDMI Founders adopted a new agreement covering the five-year period beginning January 1, 2018. The amount of our portion of the royalty allocation is dependent on the royalties generated by adopter sales of royalty-bearing HDMI technology, which are subject to variability in economic trends particularly in the market for consumer electronics.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our new and existing intellectual property rights, our financial results and our ability to compete effectively may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and we rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology, however, we may be unsuccessful in asserting our intellectual property rights or such rights may be invalidated, violated, circumvented, or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims, or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors Related to Overall General Business & Operations\nOur business depends on the proper functioning of internal processes and information technology systems. A failure of these processes and systems, data breaches, cyber-attacks, or cyber-fraud may cause business disruptions, compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, or result in losses.\nWe rely on various information technology (\"IT\") networks and systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly make changes to improve them as necessary by periodically implementing new, or upgrading or enhancing existing, operational and IT systems, procedures, and controls. These systems are supported by subcontractors, and they may also be subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and data privacy is complex and evolving. We continue to commit significant resources to implementing new systems to standardize our processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. We are focused on realizing the full analytical functionality of these conversions, which can be extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of legacy systems and processes that must be integrated.\nIn the normal course of business, we may implement new or updated IT systems and, as a result, we may experience delays or disruptions in the integration of these systems, or the related procedures or controls. The policies and security measures established with our IT systems may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud. We may also encounter errors in data, an inability to accurately process or record transactions, and security or technical reliability issues. All of these could harm our ability to conduct core operating functions such as processing invoices, shipping and receiving, recording and reporting financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, and could impact our internal control compliance efforts. If the technical solution or end user training are inadequate, it could limit our ability to manufacture and ship products as planned. We have various systems that remain that may be nearing the end of their useful life or vendor support, which will ultimately need to be replaced.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our networks and the networks of our business partners and third-party providers, including proprietary and confidential information relating to our intellectual property, personnel, and business, and that of our customers and third-party providers. Companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking, phishing, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access or engage in fraudulent behavior. Cyber-attacks have become more prevalent, sophisticated and much harder to detect and defend against and it is often difficult to anticipate or detect such incidents and to assess the damage caused by them. Our policies and security measures cannot guarantee security, and our information technology infrastructure, including our networks and systems, may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud. In the past, third parties have attempted to penetrate and/or infect our network and systems with malicious software and phishing attacks in an effort to gain access to our network and systems. In addition, we are subject to the risk of third parties falsifying invoices and similar fraud, frequently by obtaining unauthorized access to our vendors\u2019 and business partners\u2019 networks.\nIn some circumstances, we may partner with third-party providers and provide them with certain sensitive data. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, this sensitive data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information and subject us to third party claims.\nThe increase in cyber-attacks has resulted in an increased focus on cybersecurity by certain government agencies. Cyber-attacks or any investigation or enforcement action related to cybersecurity could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. In addition, we may incur loss as a result of cyber-fraud, such as those experienced by other companies by making unauthorized payments irrespective of robust internal controls.\nFailure of our IT systems or difficulties or delays in maintaining, managing, and integrating them could adversely affect the Company\u2019s controls and procedures and could impact the Company's ability to perform necessary operations, which could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our reputation, brand, and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to third-party claims or governmental penalties in the event of a security breach.\nWe regularly test for goodwill and other impairments as required under U.S. GAAP, and we may incur future impairments.\nWe are required under U.S. GAAP to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and to test goodwill and long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment at any other time that circumstances arise indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company currently operates as one reporting unit: the core Lattice (\"Core\") business, which includes intellectual property and semiconductor devices. We had no impairment charges in either fiscal 2020 or 2019. Impairment charges related to amortizable intangible assets from the Silicon Image acquisition totaled approximately $12.5 million in fiscal 2018. There is no certainty that future impairment tests will indicate that goodwill or amortizable intangible assets will be deemed recoverable. As we continue to review our business operations and test for impairment or in connection with possible sales of assets, we may have impairment charges in the future, which may be material.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and could cause us to change our business practices.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements to conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting rules and regulations. Changes in these rules, such as the adoption of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers in fiscal 2018 or ASC 842 - Leases in fiscal 2019, has had a material effect on our financial results and affected portions of our business differently. Future changes to these rules, or in the guidance relating to interpretation and adoption of the rules, could have a significant effect on our financial results and could affect portions of our business differently.\nChanges in effective tax rates, tax laws and our global organizational structure and operations could expose us to unanticipated tax consequences.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and other countries. We have a global tax structure that aligns our corporate structure with our global business operations, and we currently operate legal entities in multiple countries. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. We may choose to consolidate or integrate certain of these entities, and these integration activities, changes in tax laws, rates, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of the Company, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of our earnings in countries with differing tax rates, and by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We make no assurance as to what taxes we pay or the ability to estimate our future effective tax rate because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate, or the potential impact of releasing our valuation allowance.\nWeakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting. We review these controls regularly and deficiencies may be identified from time to time. During the quarter ended December 28, 2019, we evaluated and remediated certain deficiencies in our information technology controls over system access and no material weakness existed at the end of the period. We previously disclosed a material weakness in 2017 related to our risk assessment involving significant unusual transactions that was remediated in 2018. In the future, we may identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, which could adversely affect our business, financial results, and stock price.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers who can respond to market demands and required product innovation. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, we could have difficulty competing in our highly competitive and innovative environment.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had approximately $171.9 million outstanding under a credit agreement, dated May 17, 2019 (the \u201cCurrent Credit Agreement\u201d). Our obligations under the Current Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our U.S. subsidiaries, and include a requirement to pay quarterly installments of approximately $4.4 million with the remaining balance due upon maturity in May 2024. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our operating and financial performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt, we may need to sell material assets, restructure or refinance our debt, or seek additional equity capital. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to sell material assets, restructure or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or we may not be able to restructure or refinance our debt without incurring significant additional fees and expenses.\nThe Current Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Company to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, make investments, make certain restricted payments, dispose of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into burdensome agreements, in each case, subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Current Credit Agreement. We are also required to maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, in each case, determined in accordance with the terms of the Current Credit Agreement.\nThe amount and terms of our indebtedness, as well as our credit rating, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u25cf our cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding indebtedness, and not to research and development, operations or business growth;\n\u25cf we might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;\n\u25cf our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in a sale or liquidation may be limited until any balance on the facility is repaid in full; and\n\u25cf our ability to incur additional debt, including for working capital, acquisitions, or other needs, is more limited.\nIf we breach a loan covenant, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of the facility. We might not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness upon acceleration. If we are unable to repay or refinance the indebtedness upon acceleration or at maturity, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our assets and subsidiaries securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nWe may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks, and, as a result, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\nWe carry insurance customary for companies in our industry, including, but not limited to, liability, property, and casualty; workers' compensation; and business interruption insurance. We also insure our employees for basic medical expenses. In addition, we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers. Other than the specific areas mentioned above, we are self-insured with respect to most other risks and exposures, and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs. The risks and exposures for which we self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain natural disasters, certain product defects, certain matters for which we indemnify third parties, political risk, certain theft, patent infringement, and employment practice matters. Should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event (such as an earthquake) or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nFactors Related to Our Markets and Product Development\nThe semiconductor industry routinely experiences cyclical market patterns and our products are used across different end markets. A significant downturn in the industry or in any of these end markets could cause a meaningful reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. These downturns can be severe and prolonged and can result in price erosion and weak demand for our products. Weak demand for our products resulting from general economic conditions affecting the end markets we serve or the semiconductor industry specifically and reduced spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in diminished product demand, high inventory levels, erosion of average prices, excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations of future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to facilities, capital equipment, and other overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, any significant upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to raw materials and third-party service providers.\nAdditionally, our products are used across different end markets, and demand for our products is difficult to predict and may vary within or among our Industrial and Automotive, Communications and Computing, and Consumer end markets. Our target markets may not grow or develop as we currently expect, and demand may increase or change in one or more of our end markets, and changes in demand may reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin and effect our operating results. We have experienced concentrations of revenue at certain customers and within certain end markets, and we regularly compete for design opportunities at these customers and within these markets. Any deterioration in these end markets, reductions in the magnitude of revenue streams, our inability to meet design and pricing requirements, or volatility in demand for our products could lead to a reduction in our revenue and adversely affect our operating results. Our success in our end markets depends on many factors, including the strength or financial performance of the customers in our end markets, our ability to timely meet rapidly changing product requirements, market needs, and our ability to maintain design wins across different markets and customers to dampen the effects of market volatility. The dynamics of the markets in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult.\nDue to these and other factors, our past results may not be reliable predictors of our future results. If we are unable to accomplish any of the foregoing, or to offset the volatility of cyclical changes in the semiconductor industry or our end markets through diversification into other markets, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur success and future revenue depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products that achieve customer and market acceptance.\nWe compete in a dynamic environment characterized by rapid technology and product evolution, generally followed by a relatively longer process of ramping up to volume production on advanced technologies. Our end customers\u2019 continued use of our products is frequently reevaluated, as certain of our customers' product life cycles are relatively short and they continually develop new products. The selection process for our products to be included in our customers' new products is highly competitive. There are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by these customers. Additionally, our markets are also characterized by evolving industry standards and increased demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometry. Our competitive position and success depend on our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption, form factor, and performance, and our addressing the evolving needs of the markets we serve, among other things. With increased introduction of new products, we expect revenue related to mature products to decline over time in a normal product life cycle. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenue derived from our newer products.\nOur future growth and the success of new product introductions depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf timely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n\u25cf ability to generate new design opportunities and design wins, including those which result in sales of significant volume;\n\u25cf achievement of necessary volume of production to achieve acceptable cost;\n\u25cf availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;\n\u25cf ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies;\n\u25cf achieving acceptable yields and obtaining adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;\n\u25cf ability to obtain advanced packaging;\n\u25cf availability of supporting software design tools;\n\u25cf utilization of predefined IP logic;\n\u25cf customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and\n\u25cf market acceptance of our customers' products.\nThe failure of any of these factors, among others, could adversely affect our product innovation, development and introduction efforts and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete against companies that have significantly greater resources than us and numerous other product solutions.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources. Consolidation in our industry may increasingly mean that our competitors have greater consolidated resources, or other synergies, that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products, as well as numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions, such as applications processor, application specific standard product, microcontroller, analog, and digital signal processing technologies. Competition from these semiconductor companies may intensify as we offer more products in any of our end markets. These competitors include established, multinational semiconductor companies, as well as emerging companies.\nWe depend on independent contractors and third parties to provide key services in our product development and operations, and any disruption of their services, or an increase in cost of these services, could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on subcontractors to provide cost effective and efficient services in our product development and supply chain functions, including test and assembly services, software and hardware development, support of intellectual property cores, inventory management, order fulfillment and direct sales logistics.\nOur operations and operating results may be adversely affected if we experience problems with our subcontractors that impact the delivery of product to our customers. These problems may include: delays in software or hardware development timelines, prolonged inability to obtain wafers or packaging materials with competitive performance and cost attributes; inability to achieve adequate yields or timely delivery; inability to meet customer timelines or demands, disruption or defects in assembly, test, or shipping services; or delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes or ramping up volume for new products. If our third-party supply chain providers were to reduce or discontinue services for us or their operations are disrupted as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease, or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, weak economic conditions, or any other reason, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFactors Related to Our Sales and Revenue\nOur revenues depend on our relationships with our distributors and on a concentrated group of end customers. An adverse change in the relationships with, or performance of, our distributors, or any reduction in the use of our products by our end customers, could harm our sales and significantly decrease our revenue.\nWe depend on a concentrated group of distributors to sell our products to end customers, complete order fulfillment, maintain sufficient inventory of our products and provide services to our end customers. In fiscal 2020, revenue attributable to sales to distributors accounted for 83% of our total revenue, with two distributors accounting for 60% of total revenue. We have significant outstanding receivables with our top distributors, and expect our distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Any adverse change to our relationships or agreements with our distributors or a failure by one or more of our distributors to perform its obligations to us could have a material impact on our business, including a reduction in our access to certain end customers or our ability to sell our products.\nIf our relationships with any material customers were to diminish, if these customers were to develop their own solutions or adopt alternative solutions or competitors' solutions, if any one or more of our concentrated groups of customers were to experience significantly adverse financial conditions, or if as a result of trade disputes or sanctions these customers were restricted from purchasing our products, our results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the inability of customers to obtain credit, the insolvency of one or more customers, or tariffs applicable to our customers\u2019 products, could impact our sales. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, require additional restructuring actions, and decrease our revenue and profitability.\nThe nature of our business and length of our sales cycle makes our revenue, gross margin and net income subject to fluctuation and difficult to accurately predict.\nA number of factors, including how products are manufactured to support end markets, yield, wafer pricing, cost of packaging raw materials, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, product quality, geographic and/or end market mix, and pricing strategies, can cause our revenue, gross margins and net income to fluctuate significantly either positively or negatively from period to period.\nWe have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. During our sales cycle, our customers typically test and evaluate our products prior to deciding to include our products into the design of their own products, and then require additional time to begin volume production of their products. This lengthy sales cycle may cause us to incur significant expenses, experience significant production delays and to incur additional inventory costs before we receive a customer order that may be delayed or never get placed. A key strategic customer may demand certain design or production resources to meet their requirements or work on a specific solution, which could cause delays in our normal development schedule and result in significant investment of our resources or missed opportunities with other potential customers. We may incur these expenses without generating revenue from our products to offset the expenses.\nWhile our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate. Our inventory levels may be higher than historical norms, from time to time, due to inventory build decisions aimed at meeting expected demand from a single large customer, reducing direct material cost or enabling responsiveness to expected demand. In the event the expected demand does not materialize, or if our short sales cycle does not generate sufficient revenue, we may be subject to incremental excess and obsolescence costs.\nThese factors make it difficult for us to accurately forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales weakens our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. While we may give guidance, the difficulty in forecasting revenues as well as the relative customer and product mix of those revenues limits our ability to provide accurate forward-looking revenue and gross margin guidance.\nAccounting requirements related to sales through our distribution channel could result in our reporting revenue in excess of demand.\nRevenue recognition standards require recognition of revenue based on estimates and may require us to record revenue from distributors that is in excess of actual end customer demand. Since we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels of our end customers, we depend on the timeliness and accuracy of resale reports from our distributors. Late or inaccurate resale reports could mask significant build-up of inventories in our distribution channel, have a detrimental effect on our ability to properly recognize revenue, and impact our ability to forecast future sales. An inventory build-up in our distribution channel could result in a slowdown in orders, requests for returns from customers, or requests to move out planned shipments. If our distributors do not ultimately sell the inventory and our estimates change, we could be required to materially correct our recognized revenue in a future period, depending on actual results. Any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results.\nFactors Related to Strategic Transactions\nAcquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and strategic partnerships could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may pursue growth opportunities by acquiring complementary businesses, solutions or technologies through strategic transactions, investments or partnerships. The identification of suitable acquisition, strategic investment or strategic partnership candidates can be costly and time consuming and can distract our management team from our current operations. If such strategic transactions require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all, and such transaction may adversely affect our liquidity and capital structure. We may also choose to divest certain non-core assets, which divestitures could lead to charges against earnings and may expose us to additional liabilities and risks. Any strategic transaction might not strengthen our competitive position, may increase some of our risks, and may be viewed negatively by our customers, partners or investors. Even if we successfully complete a strategic transaction, we may not be able to effectively integrate the acquired business, technology, systems, control environment, solutions, personnel or operations into our business or global tax structure. We may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for strategic transactions pursuant to U.S. GAAP and may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any strategic transaction. We may incur unexpected costs, claims or liabilities that we incur during the strategic transaction or that we assume from the acquired company, or we may discover adverse conditions post acquisition for which we have limited or no recourse.", "PERMNO": 75854, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LSCC"}
