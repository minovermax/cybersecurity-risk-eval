Defense funding by the U.S. Government currently faces significant pressures and is expected to continue to be under pressure due to the overall economic environment, budget deficits and competing budget priorities. Cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization and other affordability analysis by the U.S. Government on defense spending could present some additional opportunities for us, but continued pressure on U.S. Government spending on defense could adversely impact our Government Systems sales and profitability.\nThe U.S. Government has implemented various initiatives to address its fiscal challenges. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in security spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. In December 2013, the Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2013 was enacted, raising government discretionary spending limits temporarily for 2014 and 2015.\nMore recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 again raised the government discretionary spending limits temporarily for 2016 and 2017, after which the BCA will again be in force. The continued uncertainty surrounding the defense budget could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the defense industry in general.\nFurthermore, in years when the U.S. Government does not complete its annual budget and appropriations process prior to the beginning of its fiscal year (October 1), government operations are typically funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate in the new year, but generally does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays by the government in procurement of new or existing products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods. The government began operations in fiscal year 2016 under a continuing resolution that is set to expire in December 2015.\nWe offer a diverse range of defense products and services. We believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business; however, delays or termination of multiple or large programs or contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful, and any replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.\nWe depend to a significant degree on U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn addition to normal business risks, our supply of systems and products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks which are largely beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds\n\u2022\nthe ability of the U.S. Government to terminate, without prior notice, partially completed government programs and contracts that were previously authorized\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political developments, including recent U.S. Government initiatives to narrow commercial item determinations and expand cost-based pricing arrangements\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries\n\u2022\nintense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development\n\u2022\ndifficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work\n\u2022\nchanges over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, which generally result in adjustments of contract prices\n\u2022\nclaims based on U.S. Government work and violation of associated compliance and other requirements, which may result in fines, the cancellation or suspension of payments or suspension or debarment proceedings affecting potential further business with the U.S. Government\nInternational conflicts and terrorism may adversely affect our business.\nInternational conflicts and political turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere and the possibility of future terrorist attacks cause significant uncertainty with respect to business and financial markets and may adversely affect our business. These international conflicts also affect the price of oil, which has a significant impact on the financial health of our commercial customers. Although our Government Systems business may experience greater demand for its products as a result of increased government defense spending, factors arising (directly or indirectly) from international conflicts or terrorism which may adversely affect our commercial business include reduced aircraft build rates, upgrades, maintenance and spending on discretionary products such as in-flight entertainment, as well as increases in the cost of property and aviation products insurance and increased restrictions placed on our insurance policies.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in the aviation industry.\nAs a provider of products and services to the aviation industry, we are significantly affected by the overall economic condition of that industry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted, among other things, by the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in demand for aircraft (for example, softness in demand for business jets) and delayed aircraft delivery schedules\n\u2022\nbankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our existing and potential customers\n\u2022\nreductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support\n\u2022\nretirement or storage of older generation aircraft, resulting in fewer retrofits and less demand for services for those aircraft, as well as the increased availability of used equipment on the market\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing for airlines or aircraft\n\u2022\nhigh fuel costs\n\u2022\ndisruptions to commercial air travel demand\nNew airspace management technologies may impact future sales.\nThe aerospace industry is experiencing a global transition from traditional communications, navigation, surveillance and air traffic control systems to air traffic management systems utilizing satellite-based technologies that will allow pilots to fly at desired paths and speeds selected in real time, while still complying with instrument flight regulations. The transition to these technologies will require the use of digital communications systems, global positioning system navigation, satellite surveillance techniques and ground surveillance systems. These technologies are expected to result in more direct and efficient flight routes, fewer flight delays and reduced airport congestion. Although we believe that we are well positioned to participate in this market evolution, our ability to capitalize on the transition to these airspace management technologies is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in the development of the necessary satellite and ground infrastructure by the U.S. and other governments\n\u2022\ndelays in adopting national and international regulatory standards\n\u2022\ncompetitors developing better products\n\u2022\nfailure of our product development investments in communications, navigation and surveillance products that enable airspace management technologies to coincide with market evolution to, and demand for, these products\n\u2022\nthe ability and desire of customers to invest in products enabling airspace management technologies\nA global or regional recession may adversely affect us.\nIf a recession emerges that impacts where we do business, risks may include:\n\u2022\ndeclines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers\n\u2022\nadverse impacts on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources\n\u2022\nsupply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.\nIn 2015, 43 percent of our total revenues were from sales of our products and services internationally, including foreign military sales. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements and potential changes, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions and antitrust and data privacy requirements\n\u2022\nchanges in government spending on defense programs, including spending decline in European countries\n\u2022\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees\n\u2022\nrequirements of certain customers which obligate us to specified levels of in-country purchases, manufacturing or investments, known as offsets, and penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements\n\u2022\nimport and export licensing requirements and regulations\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions and partnerships that involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nWe completed the acquisitions of ICG and Pacific Avionics in 2015, the acquisition of ARINC in 2014 and several joint ventures and strategic alliances (partnerships) in the past few years. We intend to make acquisitions and partnerships in the future in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions and partnerships involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and commencing partnership operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration or commencement\n\u2022\nchallenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost and revenue synergies and other expected benefits\n\u2022\nrisk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and the targeted technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets\n\u2022\nrisk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses or joint venture\n\u2022\nrisk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns.\nDuring 2015, approximately 94 percent of our total sales were from, and a significant portion of our anticipated future sales will be from, fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can incur losses on these contracts. These fixed-price contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the customer may compel us to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the entire incremental cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these projects involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw\nmaterials, problems with subcontractors and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCosts of certain employee and retiree benefits may rise.\nAlthough we have taken action seeking to contain volatility in the costs related to medical and pension benefits, there are risks that our costs for these benefits will increase as a result of:\n\u2022\ncontinued increases in medical costs related to current employees due to increased usage of medical benefits, medical inflation and the impact of recent U.S. Government health care legislation\n\u2022\nan increase in the average life span of retirees\n\u2022\nmaterial changes in legislation or market dynamics impacting medical or pension matters\n\u2022\nthe effect declines in the stock and bond markets have on our pension plan assets\n\u2022\npotential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our retirement benefit obligations\nTax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures.\nWe depend on critical suppliers and subcontractors.\nWe do not always have alternate sources of supply readily available for certain goods or services, such as liquid crystal displays. The loss of a significant supplier or subcontractor or their inability to meet performance, quality or delivery requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on specialized test equipment.\nSome of our specialized test equipment that supports the reliability of our products and systems is the result of significant investment. Back-up test equipment may not be readily available. Damage to our specialized test equipment may result in protracted production recovery and may adversely impact our ability to service our products.\nA cybersecurity incident, network failure or other business disruption could have negative impacts.\nWe face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with damaging acts of nature, public health crises or information technology (IT) failures. Possible areas of significant exposure to cyber threats or other disruptions include our enterprise information technology resources, our information management network that provides communication services to customers and our flight deck communication products and solutions. Any of these threats or disruptions may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks may include:\n\u2022\nadverse effects to future results due to the theft, destruction, loss, corruption or release of personal data, confidential information or intellectual property\n\u2022\noperational or business disruptions resulting from the failure of IT or other systems and subsequent mitigation activities\n\u2022\nnegative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, suppliers, employees, shareowners and others\nCautionary Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain statements, including certain projections and business trends, that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
