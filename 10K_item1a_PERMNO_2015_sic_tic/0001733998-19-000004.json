{"cik": "1733998", "company": "Northwest Natural Holding Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. When considering any investment in NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption \"Forward-Looking Statements\", Item 7A, and our other documents filed with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive and the order of presentation does not reflect management\u2019s determination of priority or likelihood. Additionally, our listing of risk factors that primarily affects one of our businesses does not mean that such risk factor is inapplicable to our other businesses.\nRisks Related to our Business Generally\nREGULATORY RISK. Regulation of NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s regulated businesses, including changes in the regulatory environment, failure of regulatory authorities to approve rates which provide for timely recovery of costs and an adequate return on invested capital, or an unfavorable outcome in regulatory proceedings may adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe OPUC and WUTC have general regulatory authority over NW Natural\u2019s gas and NW Holdings\u2019 water utility businesses in Oregon and Washington, respectively, including: the rates charged to customers; authorized rates of return on rate base, including ROE; the amounts and types of securities our regulated utility companies, like NW Natural, may issue; services our regulated utility companies provide and the manner in which they provide them; the nature of investments our utility companies make; and, deferral and recovery of various expenses, including, but not limited to, pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs, commodity hedging expense, transactions with affiliated interests, certain employee benefit expenses such as pension, weather adjustment mechanisms, and other matters. The OPUC and WUTC also regulate actions investors may take with respect to our utility companies, NW Natural and NW Holdings. Similarly, FERC has regulatory authority over NW Natural\u2019s interstate storage services, and the CPUC has regulatory authority over NW Holdings\u2019 Gill Ranch storage operations. Additionally, expansion of our businesses, including into water or other sectors, could result in regulation by other regulatory authorities. For example, NW Holdings\u2019 has acquired a water utility business in Idaho that is correspondingly subject to regulatory authority of the IPUC.\nThe prices the OPUC, WUTC, IPUC, and possible future regulators allow us to charge for retail service, and the maximum FERC-approved rates FERC authorizes us to charge for interstate storage and related transportation services, are the most significant factors affecting both NW Natural\u2019s and NW Holdings\u2019 financial position, results of operations and liquidity. The OPUC, WUTC, IPUC and\npossible future regulators have the authority to disallow recovery of costs they find imprudently incurred or otherwise disallowed. Additionally, the rates allowed may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred. We expect to continue to make expenditures to expand, improve and operate our gas and water utility distribution and gas storage systems. Regulators can find such expansions or improvements of expenditures were not prudently incurred, and deny recovery. Additionally, while the OPUC, WUTC and IPUC have established an authorized rate of return for our utility businesses through the ratemaking process, the regulatory process does not provide assurance that we will be able to achieve the earnings level authorized. Moreover, in the normal course of business we may place assets in service or incur higher than expected levels of operating expense before rate cases can be filed to recover those costs-this is commonly referred to as regulatory lag. The failure of any regulatory commission to approve requested rate increases on a timely basis to recover increased costs or to allow an adequate return could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs companies with regulated utility businesses, we frequently have dockets open with our regulators. The regulatory proceedings for these dockets typically involve multiple parties, including governmental agencies, consumer advocacy groups, and other third parties. Each party has differing concerns, but all generally have the common objective of limiting amounts included in rates. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these deferred proceedings or the effects of those outcomes on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RISK. Certain of NW Natural\u2019s, and possibly NW Holdings\u2019, properties and facilities may pose environmental risks requiring remediation, the costs of which are difficult to estimate and which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties that require environmental remediation or other action. NW Holdings or NW Natural may now, or in the future, own other properties that require environmental remediation or other action. NW Natural and NW Holdings accrue all material loss contingencies relating to these properties. A regulatory asset at NW Natural has been recorded for estimated costs pursuant to a Deferral Order from the OPUC and WUTC. In addition to maintaining regulatory deferrals, NW Natural settled with most of its historical liability insurers for only a portion of the costs it has incurred to date and expects to incur in the future. To the extent amounts NW Natural recovered from insurance are inadequate and it is unable to recover these deferred costs in utility customer rates, NW Natural would be required to reduce its regulatory assets which would result in a charge to earnings in the year in which regulatory assets are reduced. In addition, in Oregon, the OPUC approved the SRRM, which limits recovery of deferred amounts to those amounts which satisfy an annual prudence review and an earnings test that requires NW Natural to contribute additional amounts toward environmental remediation costs above approximately $10 million in years in which NW Natural earns above its\nauthorized ROE. To the extent NW Natural earns more than its authorized ROE in a year, it would be required to cover environmental expenses greater than the $10 million with those earnings that exceed its authorized ROE. The OPUC ordered a review of the SRRM in 2018 or when we obtain greater certainty of environmental costs, whichever occurs first. We submitted information for review in 2018, and believe we could be subject to further review. These ongoing prudence reviews, the earnings test, or the periodic review could reduce the amounts NW Natural is allowed to recover, and could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, we may have disputes with regulators and other parties as to the severity of particular environmental matters, what remediation efforts are appropriate, and the portion of the costs NW Natural or NW Holdings should bear. We cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental investigations, remediation or other action, the portions of these costs allocable to NW Natural or NW Holdings, or disputes or litigation arising in relation thereto.\nEnvironmental liability estimates are based on current remediation technology, industry experience gained at similar sites, an assessment of probable level of responsibility, and the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. However, it is difficult to estimate such costs due to uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation, the preliminary nature of certain site investigations, and the application of environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties. These uncertainties and disputes arising therefrom could lead to further adversarial administrative proceedings or litigation, with associated costs and uncertain outcomes, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION COMPLIANCE RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to environmental regulations for our ongoing businesses, compliance with which could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment, including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, and other aspects of environmental regulation. For example, our natural gas operations are subject to reporting requirements to the EPA and the ODEQ regarding greenhouse gas emissions. These and other current and future additional environmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may or may not be recoverable in customer rates or through insurance. If these costs are not recoverable, they could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nGLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE RISK. Future legislation, regulation or other initiatives (including ballot initiatives) to address global climate change may expose NW Holdings and NW Natural to regulatory and financial risk. Additionally, our businesses may be subject to physical risks associated with climate change, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are a number of international, federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt to measure, control or limit the effects of global warming and climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. For example, there are current legislative efforts in Oregon, Washington, and other states in which we operate to cap or otherwise restrict the maximum GHGs an entity may emit without reduction efforts or other undertakings. Such current or future legislation, regulation or other initiatives (including ballot initiatives) could impose on our natural gas businesses operational requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency initiatives, or levy a tax based on carbon content. Such initiatives could result in us incurring additional costs to comply with the imposed restrictions, provide a cost advantage to energy sources other than natural gas, reduce demand for natural gas, impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, impact the prices we charge our customers, impose increased costs on us associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to such requirements, and may impact cultural perception of our services or products negatively, diminishing the value of our brand, all of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s business practices, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may cause physical risks, including an increase in sea level, intensified storms, water scarcity and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and extreme wind or other climate conditions. A significant portion of the nation\u2019s gas infrastructure is located in areas susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to gas supply interruptions and price spikes.\nThese and other physical changes could result in disruptions to natural gas production and transportation systems potentially increasing the cost of gas and affecting our natural gas businesses\u2019 ability to procure gas to meet customer demand. These changes could also affect our distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs, disruption of service, regulatory actions and lower customer satisfaction. Similar disruptions could occur in NW Holdings\u2019 water utility businesses. Additionally, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health or weather conditions of our service territory directly, it could adversely impact customer demand or our customers' ability to pay. Such physical risks could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSTRATEGIC TRANSACTION RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, business development projects or other strategic transactions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown problems or liabilities or problems or liabilities undisclosed to us, and the risk that for these or other reasons, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we anticipate from such transactions, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, NW Holdings and NW Natural have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, business development projects or other strategic transactions, including the entry by NW Holdings into the water sector through the acquisition of a number of water utilities and a water services company, with NW Holdings\u2019 continuing to seek other such opportunities to acquire additional water companies. Any such transactions involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022\npurchase or sale transactions that are contracted for may fail to close for a variety of reasons;\n\u2022\nacquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nacquired businesses or assets could have, environmental, permitting, or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;\n\u2022\nthere may be difficulties in integration or operation costs of new businesses;\n\u2022\nthere may be liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to us, or we may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all; or\n\u2022\nwe may agree to sell assets for a price that is less than the book value of those assets.\nOne of more of these conditions could affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s business development projects may encounter unanticipated obstacles, costs, changes or delays that could result in a project becoming impaired, which could negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness development projects involve many risks. We are currently engaged in several business development projects, including, but not limited to, NW Holdings\u2019 early planning and development stages for a regional pipeline in Oregon, and NW Natural\u2019s expansion of its gas storage facility at Mist. We may also engage in other business\ndevelopment projects such as investments in additional long-term gas reserves, CNG refueling stations, RNG projects, or projects in the water sector. These projects may not be successful. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain required governmental permits and approvals to complete our projects in a cost-efficient or timely manner, potentially resulting in delays or abandonment of the projects. We could also experience issues such as: startup and construction delays; construction cost overruns; disputes with contractors; the inability to negotiate acceptable agreements such as rights-of-way, easements, construction, gas supply or other material contracts; changes in customer demand or commitment; public opposition to projects; changes in market prices; and operating cost increases. Additionally, we may be unable to finance our business development projects at acceptable interest rates or within a scheduled time frame necessary for completing the project. One or more of these events could result in the project becoming impaired, and such impairment could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nJOINT PARTNER RISK. Investing in business development projects through partnerships, joint ventures or other business arrangements affects our ability to manage certain risks and could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use joint ventures and other business arrangements to manage and diversify the risks of certain development projects, including NW Holdings\u2019 Trail West pipeline and Gill Ranch Facility and NW Natural\u2019s gas reserves agreements. NW Holdings or NW Natural may acquire or develop part-ownership interests in other projects in the future, including but not limited to, in the water sector. Under these arrangements, we may not be able to fully direct the management and policies of the business relationships, and other participants in those relationships may take action contrary to our interests, including making operational decisions that could negatively affect our costs and liabilities. In addition, other participants may withdraw from the project, divest important assets, become financially distressed or bankrupt, or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. For example, in January 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, which owns the remaining 25 percent of the Gill Ranch Facility (75 percent of which is owned by NW Holdings), filed for bankruptcy protection. While NW Holdings will monitor that bankruptcy proceeding, and take appropriate actions in an attempt to protect its interests, it does not control, and cannot predict, the outcome of such proceedings and the impact, if any, of the proceeding on the operations of Gill Ranch or the planned sale by NW Holdings\u2019 of its interest in Gill Ranch.\nNW Natural\u2019s gas reserves arrangements, which operate as a hedge backed by physical gas supplies, involve a number of risks, including: gas production that is significantly less than the expected volumes, or no gas volumes; operating costs that are higher than expected; changes in the consolidated tax position or tax laws that could affect NW Natural\u2019s ability to take, or the timing of, certain tax benefits that impact the financial outcome of this transaction; inherent risks of gas production, including disruption to\noperations or a complete shut-in of the field; and one or more participants in one of these gas reserves arrangements acting contrary to NW Natural\u2019s interests. In addition, while the cost of the original gas reserves venture is currently included in customer rates and additional wells under that arrangement are recovered at specific costs, the occurrence of one or more of these risks could affect NW Natural\u2019s ability to recover this hedge in rates. Further, new gas reserves arrangements have not been approved for inclusion in rates, and regulators may ultimately determine to not include all or a portion of future transactions in rates. The realization of any of the above mentioned situations could adversely impact NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOPERATING RISK. Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs, some or all of which may not be fully covered by insurance, and which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the businesses of gas distribution and storage, and water distribution, including:\n\u2022\nearthquakes, floods, storms, landslides and other severe weather incidents and natural hazards;\n\u2022\nleaks, losses or contamination of natural gas by other chemicals or compounds or by or of local water as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n\u2022\ndamages from third parties, including construction, farm and utility equipment or other surface users;\n\u2022\noperator errors;\n\u2022\nnegative performance by our storage reservoirs, facilities, or wells that could cause us to fail to meet expected or forecasted operational levels or contractual commitments to our customers;\n\u2022\nproblems maintaining, or the malfunction of, pipelines, wellbores and related equipment and facilities that form a part of the infrastructure that is critical to the operation of our gas distribution and storage facilities;\n\u2022\ncollapse of underground storage caverns;\n\u2022\noperating costs that are substantially higher than expected;\n\u2022\nmigration of natural gas through faults in the rock or to some area of the reservoir where existing wells cannot drain the gas effectively, resulting in loss of the gas;\n\u2022\nblowouts (uncontrolled escapes of gas from a pipeline or well) or other accidents, fires and explosions; and\n\u2022\nrisks and hazards inherent in the drilling operations associated with the development of the gas storage facilities, and wells.\nThese risks could result in personal injury or loss of human life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, breaches of our contractual commitments, and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations, which in turn could lead to significant costs and lost revenues. Further, because our pipeline, storage and distribution facilities are in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, any loss of human life or adverse financial outcomes resulting from such events could be significant. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain the level or types of insurance we desire, and the\ninsurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. The occurrence of any operating risks not covered by insurance could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural may be adversely impacted by local or national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities, cyber-attacks or data breaches, and other extreme events to which we may not be able to promptly respond, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nLocal or national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities, cyber-attacks and data breaches, and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in critical infrastructure industries may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism, including physical and security breaches of our information technology infrastructure in the form of cyber-attacks. These attacks could target or impact our technology or mechanical systems that operate our distribution, transmission or storage facilities and result in a disruption in our operations, damage to our system and inability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas or other necessary commodities that could affect our operations. Threatened or actual national disasters or terrorist activities may also disrupt capital or bank markets and our ability to raise capital or obtain debt financing, or impact our suppliers or our customers directly. Local disaster or pandemic illness could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. A slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on our operations and earnings. We may not be able to maintain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other events. Additionally, large scale natural disasters or terrorist attacks could destabilize the insurance industry making insurance we do have unavailable, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations or financial results.\nHOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RISK. As a holding company, NW Holdings depends on its operating subsidiaries, including NW Natural, to meet financial obligations and the ability of NW Holdings to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the receipt of dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries, including NW Natural.\nAs a holding company, NW Holdings\u2019 only significant assets are the stock and membership interests of its operating subsidiaries, which at this time is primarily NW Natural. NW Holdings\u2019 direct and indirect subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, managed by their own boards of directors, and have no obligation to pay any amounts to their respective shareholders, whether through dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of these companies to pay dividends or make other distributions on their common stock is subject to, among other things: their results of operations, net income, cash flows and financial condition, as well as the success of their business strategies and\ngeneral economic and competitive conditions; the prior rights of holders of existing and future debt securities and any future preferred stock issued by those companies; and any applicable legal restrictions.\nIn addition, the ability of NW Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions is subject to applicable state law and regulatory restrictions. Under the OPUC and WUTC regulatory approvals for the holding company formation, if NW Natural ceases to comply with credit and capital structure requirements approved by the OPUC and WUTC, it will not, with limited exceptions, be permitted to pay dividends to NW Holdings. Under the OPUC and WUTC orders authorizing the holding company reorganization, NW Natural may not pay dividends or make distributions to NW Holdings if NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings and common equity levels fall below specified ratings and levels. If NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings are below A- for S&P and A3 for Moody\u2019s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural\u2019s common equity is 45% or above. If NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings are below BBB for S&P and Baa2 for Moody\u2019s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural\u2019s common equity is 46% or above. Dividends may not be issued if NW Natural\u2019s long-term secured credit ratings fall to BB+ or below for S&P or Ba1 or below for Moody\u2019s, or if NW Natural\u2019s common equity is below 44%. In each case, with the common equity level to be determined on a preceding or projected 13-month basis.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT RISK. The cost of providing pension and postretirement healthcare benefits is subject to changes in pension assets and liabilities, changing employee demographics and changing actuarial assumptions, which may have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUntil NW Natural closed the pension plans to new hires, which for non-union employees was in 2006 and for union employees was in 2009, it provided pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible full-time utility employees and retirees. About half of NW Natural\u2019s current utility employees were hired prior to these dates, and therefore remain eligible for these plans. Other businesses we acquire may also have pension plans. The costs of NW Natural, or the other applicable businesses we may acquire, for providing such benefits is subject to change in the market value of the pension assets, changes in employee demographics including longer life expectancies, increases in healthcare costs, current and future legislative changes, and various actuarial calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension and postretirement healthcare expenses may differ materially from actual results due to significant market fluctuations and changing withdrawal rates, wage rates, interest rates and other factors. These differences may result in an adverse impact on the amount of pension contributions, pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods. Sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond rates may have a material adverse effect on the value of the pension fund assets and liabilities. In these circumstances, NW Natural may be required to recognize increased contributions and pension expense earlier than it had planned to the extent that the value of pension assets is less than the total\nanticipated liability under the plans, which could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWORKFORCE RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s businesses are heavily dependent on being able to attract and retain qualified employees and maintain a competitive cost structure with market-based salaries and employee benefits, and workforce disruptions could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operations and results.\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our largely older workforce retires. We expect that a significant portion of our workforce will retire within the current decade, which will require that we attract, train and retain skilled workers to prevent loss of institutional knowledge or skills gaps. Without an appropriately skilled workforce, our ability to provide quality service and meet our regulatory requirements will be challenged and this could negatively impact NW Holding\u2019s and NW Natural\u2019s earnings. Additionally, a majority of NW Natural workers are represented by the OPEIU Local No.11 AFL-CIO, and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that extends to November 30, 2019. Disputes with the union representing NW Natural employees over terms and conditions of their agreement, or failure to timely and effectively renegotiate the agreement, could result in instability in our labor relationship and work stoppages that could impact the timely delivery of gas and other services from our utility and storage facilities, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues. The collective bargaining agreements may also limit our flexibility in dealing with NW Natural\u2019s workforce, and the ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today\u2019s challenging marketplace, which may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGISLATIVE, COMPLIANCE AND TAXING AUTHORITY RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to governmental regulation, and compliance with local, state and federal requirements, including taxing requirements, and unforeseen changes in or interpretations of such requirements could affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities. We are required to comply with a variety of laws and regulations and to obtain authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies in various aspects of our business. Significant changes in federal, state, or local governmental leadership can accelerate or amplify changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner in which they are interpreted or enforced. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration has made numerous leadership changes at federal administrative agencies since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Moreover, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. presidential administration may\nmake substantial changes to fiscal, tax, regulation and other federal policies. The current U.S. presidential administration has called for and implemented significant changes to U.S. fiscal policies, U.S. trade, healthcare, immigration, foreign, and government regulatory policy. To the extent the U.S. Congress or U.S. presidential administration implements changes to U.S. policy, those changes may impact, among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade and relations, unemployment, immigration, corporate taxes, healthcare, the U.S. regulatory environment, inflation and other areas. In addition, foreign governments may implement changes to their policies, in response to changes to U.S. policy or otherwise. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our businesses, they could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our businesses and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them.\nThough we cannot predict changes in laws, regulations, or enforcement, we expect there to continue to be a number of significant changes. We cannot predict with certainty the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations. Additionally, any failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or injunctive measures that could affect operating assets. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil authority under the Natural Gas Act to impose penalties for current violations of in excess of $1 million per day for each violation. In addition, as the regulatory environment for our businesses increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance may also increase. Changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, and the failure to comply with laws and regulations could negatively influence NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operating environment and results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in federal, state or local tax laws and their related regulations, or differing interpretations or enforcement of applicable law by a federal, state or local taxing authority, could result in substantial cost to us and negatively affect our results of operations. Tax law and its related regulations and case law are inherently complex and dynamic. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation. Our judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Changes in laws, regulations or adverse judgments and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn this regard, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was approved by the U.S. Congress on December 20, 2017 and signed into law by the U.S. President on December 22, 2017. This legislation makes significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such changes include a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and limitations on certain corporate deductions and credits, among other\nchanges. Certain of these changes may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is uncertainty as to how our regulators will reflect the impact of the legislation in rates. The resulting ratemaking treatment may negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSAFETY REGULATION RISK. NW Holdings and NW Natural may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our systems and operations, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nThe safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is and will remain our top priority. We are committed to consistently monitoring and maintaining our distribution systems and storage operations to ensure that natural gas is acquired, stored and delivered safely, reliably and efficiently. Given recent high-profile natural gas explosions, leaks and accidents in other parts of the country involving both distribution systems and storage facilities, we anticipate that the natural gas industry may be the subject of even greater federal, state and local regulatory oversight. For example, in 2016, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) was signed into law increasing regulations for natural gas storage pipelines and underground storage facilities. Similarly, in 2016, California passed legislation directing the Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) to develop regulations affecting gas storage operations. DOGGR has issued regulations which require certain integrity testing and tubing for wells at the Gill Ranch Facility within the next 7 years.\nWe intend to work diligently with industry associations and federal and state regulators to seek to ensure compliance with these and other new laws. We expect there to be increased costs associated with compliance, and those costs could be significant. If these costs are not recoverable in our customer rates, they could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nHEDGING RISK. NW Natural\u2019s risk management policies and hedging activities cannot eliminate the risk of commodity price movements and other financial market risks, and its hedging activities may expose it to additional liabilities for which rate recovery may be disallowed, which could result in an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating revenues, costs, derivative assets and liabilities and operating cash flows.\nNW Natural\u2019s gas purchasing requirements expose it to risks of commodity price movements, while its use of debt and equity financing exposes it to interest rate, liquidity and other financial market risks. NW Natural attempts to manage these exposures with both financial and physical hedging mechanisms, including its gas reserves transactions which are hedges backed by physical gas supplies. While NW Natural has risk management procedures for hedging in place, they may not always work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with hedging. Additionally, NW Natural\u2019s hedging activities may cause it to\nincur additional expenses to obtain the hedge. NW Natural does not hedge its entire interest rate or commodity cost exposure, and the unhedged exposure will vary over time. Gains or losses experienced through hedging activities, including carrying costs, generally flow through NW Natural\u2019s PGA mechanism or are recovered in future general rate cases. However, the hedge transactions NW Natural enters into for utility purposes are subject to a prudence review by the OPUC and WUTC, and, if found imprudent, those expenses may be, and have been previously, disallowed, which could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, NW Natural\u2019s actual business requirements and available resources may vary from forecasts, which are used as the basis for its hedging decisions, and could cause its exposure to be more or less than anticipated. Moreover, if NW Natural\u2019s derivative instruments and hedging transactions do not qualify for regulatory deferral and it does not elect hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nNW Natural also has credit-related exposure to derivative counterparties. Counterparties owing NW Natural or its subsidiaries money or physical natural gas commodities could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, NW Natural may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements to meet its normal business requirements. In that event, NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected. Additionally, under most of NW Natural\u2019s hedging arrangements, any downgrade of its senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating could allow its counterparties to require NW Natural to post cash, a letter of credit or other form of collateral, which would expose NW Natural to additional costs and may trigger significant increases in borrowing from its credit facilities or equity contribution needs from NW Holdings, if the credit rating downgrade is below investment grade. Further, based on current interpretations, NW Natural is not considered a \"swap dealer\" or \"major swap participant\" in 2019, so NW Natural is exempt from certain requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. If NW Natural is unable to claim this exemption, it could be subject to higher costs for its derivatives activities, and such higher costs could have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating costs and financial results.\nINABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKET RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s inability to access capital, or significant increases in the cost of capital, could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s ability to obtain adequate and cost effective short-term and long-term financing depends on maintaining investment grade credit profiles as well as the existence of liquid and stable financial markets. NW Holdings relies on access to equity and bank markets to finance equity contributions to subsidiaries and other business requirements. NW Natural relies on access to capital and bank markets, including commercial paper and bond markets, to finance its operations, construction\nexpenditures and other business requirements, and to refund maturing debt that cannot be funded entirely by internal cash flows. Disruptions in capital markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term financing. Our access to funds under committed credit facilities, which are currently provided by a number of banks, is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Disruptions in the bank or capital financing markets as a result of economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of the financial sector, or failure of major financial institutions could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s access to capital and negatively impact our ability to run our businesses and make strategic investments.\nNW Natural is currently rated by S&P and Moody\u2019s and a negative change in its credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could adversely affect its cost of borrowing and access to sources of liquidity and capital.\nSuch a downgrade could further limit its access to borrowing under available credit lines. Additionally, downgrades in its current credit ratings below investment grade could cause additional delays in NW Natural's ability to access the capital markets while it seeks supplemental state regulatory approval, which could hamper its ability to access credit markets on a timely basis. NW Holdings' credit profile is largely supported by NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings and any negative change in NW Natural\u2019s credit ratings would likely negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 access to sources of liquidity and capital and cost of borrowing. A credit downgrade to NW Natural, or resulting negative impact on NW Holdings, could also require additional support in the form of letters of credit, cash or other forms of collateral and otherwise adversely affect NW Holdings' or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nREPUTATIONAL RISKS. Customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of NW Holdings and NW Natural are affected by many factors, including system reliability and safety, protection of customer information, rates, media coverage, and public sentiment. To the extent that customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of our businesses, NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA number of factors can affect customer satisfaction including: service interruptions or safety concerns due to failures of equipment or facilities or from other causes, and our ability to promptly respond to such failures; our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information; the timing and magnitude of rate increases; and volatility of rates. Customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including the proliferation of social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation.\nIf customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our services, this could result in increased regulatory oversight and could affect the returns on common equity we are allowed to earn. Additionally,\nnegative opinions about us could make it more difficult for us to achieve favorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. Negative opinions could also result in sales volumes reductions or increased use of other sources of energy. Any of these consequences could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s efforts to integrate, consolidate and streamline each of their operations has resulted in increased reliance on technology, the failure or security breach of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the last several years NW Holdings and NW Natural have undertaken a variety of initiatives to integrate, standardize, centralize and streamline operations. These efforts have resulted in greater reliance on technological tools such as, at NW Natural: an enterprise resource planning system, an automated dispatch system, an automated meter reading system, a customer information system, a web-based ordering and tracking system, and other similar technological tools and initiatives. The failure of any of these or other similarly important technologies, or our inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies, could adversely impact operations. We take precautions to protect our systems, but there is no guarantee that the procedures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and systems are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches. Our businesses could experience breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by us in the normal course of business, which could adversely affect our reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation, any of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we rely on information technology systems in the operation of our businesses. There are various risks associated with these systems, including hardware and software failure, communications failure, data distortion or destruction, unauthorized access to data, misuse of proprietary or confidential data, unauthorized control through electronic means, programming mistakes and other inadvertent errors or deliberate human acts. In particular, cyber security attacks, data breaches, terrorism or other malicious acts could damage, destroy or disrupt all of our business systems. Any failure of information technology systems could result in a loss of operating revenues, an increase in operating expenses and costs to repair or replace damaged assets. As these potential cyber security attacks become more common and sophisticated, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems or obtain specific insurance coverage against potential losses.\nREGULATORY ACCOUNTING RISK. In the future, NW Holdings or NW Natural may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting practices for all or a portion of our regulated operations.\nIf we can no longer apply regulatory accounting, we could be required to write off our regulatory assets and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates at the time such amounts are incurred, even if we are expected to recover these amounts from customers in the future.\nGAS PRICE RISK. Higher natural gas commodity prices and volatility in the price of gas may adversely affect NW Natural\u2019s NGD business, whereas lower gas price volatility may adversely affect NW Natural\u2019s and NW Holdings\u2019 gas storage business, in each case negatively affecting NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of natural gas is affected by a variety of factors, including weather, changes in demand, the level of production and availability of natural gas supplies, transportation constraints, availability and cost of pipeline\ncapacity, federal and state energy and environmental regulation and legislation, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, national and worldwide economic and political conditions, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. At NW Natural, the cost we pay for natural gas is generally passed through to customers through an annual PGA rate adjustment. If gas prices were to increase significantly, it would raise the cost of energy to NW Natural\u2019s customers, potentially causing those customers to conserve or switch to alternate sources of energy. Significant price increases could also cause new home builders and commercial developers to select alternative energy sources. Decreases in the volume of gas NW Natural sells could reduce NW Holdings or NW Natural\u2019s earnings, and a decline in customers could slow growth in future earnings. Additionally, because a portion (10% or 20%) of any difference between the estimated average PGA gas cost in rates and the actual average gas cost incurred is recognized as current income or expense, higher average gas costs than those assumed in setting rates can adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s operating cash flows, liquidity and results of operations. Additionally, notwithstanding NW Natural\u2019s current rate structure, higher gas costs could result in increased pressure on the OPUC or the WUTC to seek other means to reduce NW Natural\u2019s rates, which also could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nHigher gas prices may also cause NW Natural to experience an increase in short-term debt and temporarily reduce liquidity because it pays suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be in advance of when these costs are recovered through rates. Significant increases in the price of gas can also slow collection efforts as customers experience increased difficulty in paying their higher energy bills, leading to higher than normal delinquent accounts receivable resulting in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\nConversely, storage businesses benefit from price volatility, which impacts the level of demand for services and the rates that can be charged for storage services. Largely due to the abundant supply of natural gas made available by hydraulic fracturing techniques, natural gas prices have dropped significantly to levels that are near historic lows. If prices and volatility remain low or decline further, then the\ndemand for storage services, and the prices that we will be able to charge for those services, may decline or be depressed for a prolonged period of time. Prices below the costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to shut-in all or a portion of the facility. A sustained decline in these prices or a shut-in of all or a portion of the facility could have an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR GOODWILL RISK. Impairments of the value of long-lived assets or goodwill could have a material effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, or results of operations.\nNW Holdings and NW Natural review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operation of such assets. Projected cash flows depend on the future operating costs and projected revenues associated with the asset. In 2017, NW Natural recognized a $192.5 million impairment of long-lived assets at the Gill Ranch Facility as of December 31, 2017. We review our other long-lived assets to determine if an impairment analysis is necessary.\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. A goodwill impairment analysis begins with a qualitative analysis of events and circumstances. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying value may be at risk, we will perform a quantitative assessment and recognize a goodwill impairment for any amount in which the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Any impairment charge taken with respect to our long-lived assets or goodwill could be material and could have a material effect on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCUSTOMER GROWTH RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s NGD margin, earnings and cash flow may be negatively affected if we are unable to sustain customer growth rates in our NGD segment.\nNW Natural\u2019s NGD margins and earnings growth have largely depended upon the sustained growth of its residential and commercial customer base due, in part, to the new construction housing market, conversions of customers to natural gas from other energy sources and growing commercial use of natural gas. The last recession slowed new construction. While new home construction has resumed and the multi-family composition has been higher than its pre-recession pace, overall construction has not returned to the pre-recession pace, and there are predictions of an impending new recessionary cycle. Insufficient growth in these markets, for economic, political or other reasons could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s utility margin, earnings and cash flows.\nRISK OF COMPETITION. Our NGD business is subject to increased competition which could negatively affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nIn the residential and commercial markets, NW Natural\u2019s NGD business competes primarily with suppliers of electricity, fuel oil, and propane. In the industrial market, NW Natural competes with suppliers of all forms of energy. Competition among these forms of energy is based on price, efficiency, reliability, performance, market conditions, technology, environmental impacts and public perception. Technological improvements in other energy sources such as heat pumps, batteries or other alternative technologies could erode NW Natural\u2019s competitive advantage. If natural gas prices rise relative to other energy sources, or if the cost, environmental impact or public perception of such other energy sources improves relative to natural gas, it may negatively affect NW Natural\u2019s ability to attract new customers or retain our existing residential, commercial and industrial customers, which could have a negative impact on our customer growth rate and NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nOur natural gas storage operations compete primarily with other storage facilities and pipelines. Natural gas storage is an increasingly competitive business, with the ability to expand or build new storage capacity in California, the U.S. Rocky Mountains and elsewhere in the United States and Canada. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand for our natural gas storage services, drive prices down for our storage business, and adversely affect our ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows, which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SUPPLY NATURAL GAS RISK. NW Natural relies on third parties to supply the natural gas in its NGD segment, and limitations on NW Natural\u2019s ability to obtain supplies, or failure to receive expected supplies for which it has contracted, could have an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial results.\nNW Natural\u2019s ability to secure natural gas for current and future sales depends upon its ability to purchase and receive delivery of supplies of natural gas from third parties. NW Natural, and in some cases, its suppliers of natural gas, does not have control over the availability of natural gas supplies, competition for those supplies, disruptions in those supplies, priority allocations on transmission pipelines, or pricing of those supplies. Additionally, third parties on whom NW Natural relies may fail to deliver gas for which it has contracted. For example, on October 9, 2018, a 36-inch pipeline near Prince George, British Columbia owned by Enbridge ruptured, disrupting natural gas flows from Canada into Washington while the ruptured pipeline and an adjacent pipeline were assessed and the ruptured pipeline was repaired. Once repaired, pressurization levels for those pipelines were reduced for assessment and testing. If NW Natural is unable or limited in its ability to obtain natural gas from its current suppliers or new sources, it may not be able to meet customers' gas requirements and would likely incur costs associated with actions necessary to mitigate service disruptions, both of which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nSINGLE TRANSPORTATION PIPELINE RISK. NW Natural relies on a single pipeline company for the transportation of gas to its service territory, a disruption of which could adversely impact its ability to meet customers\u2019 gas requirements, which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nNW Natural\u2019s distribution system is directly connected to a single interstate pipeline, which is owned and operated by Northwest Pipeline. The pipeline\u2019s gas flows are bi-directional, transporting gas into the Portland metropolitan market from two directions: (1) the north, which brings supplies from the British Columbia and Alberta supply basins; and (2) the east, which brings supplies from the Alberta and the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply basins. If there is a rupture or inadequate capacity in the pipeline, NW Natural may not be able to meet its customers\u2019 gas requirements and we would likely incur costs associated with actions necessary to mitigate service disruptions, both of which could significantly and negatively impact NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s results of operations.\nTHIRD PARTY PIPELINE RISK. NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s gas storage businesses depend on third-party pipelines that connect our storage facilities to interstate pipelines, the failure or unavailability of which could adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur gas storage facilities are reliant on the continued operation of a third-party pipeline and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our storage facilities. Because we do not own all of these pipelines, their operations are not within our control. If the third-party pipeline to which we are connected were to become unavailable for current or future withdrawals or injections of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the infrastructure, lack of capacity or other reasons, our ability to operate efficiently and satisfy our customers\u2019 needs could be compromised, thereby potentially having an adverse impact on NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWEATHER RISK. Warmer than average weather may have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to weather risk in our natural gas business, primarily at NW Natural. A majority of NW Natural\u2019s gas volume is driven by gas sales to space heating residential and commercial customers during the winter heating season. Current NW Natural rates are based on an assumption of average weather. Warmer than average weather typically results in lower gas sales. Colder weather typically results in higher gas sales. Although the effects of warmer or colder weather on utility margin in Oregon are expected to be mitigated through the operation of NW Natural\u2019s weather normalization mechanism, weather variations from normal could adversely affect utility margin because NW Natural may be required to purchase more or less gas at spot rates, which may be higher or lower than the rates assumed in its PGA. Also, a portion of NW Natural\u2019s Oregon residential and commercial customers (usually less than 10%) have opted out of the weather normalization mechanism, and 11% of its customers are\nlocated in Washington where it does not have a weather normalization mechanism. These effects could have an adverse effect on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCUSTOMER CONSERVATION RISK. Customers\u2019 conservation efforts may have a negative impact on NW Holdings\u2019 and NW Natural\u2019s revenues.\nAn increasing national focus on energy conservation, including improved building practices and appliance efficiencies may result in increased energy conservation by customers. This can decrease NW Natural\u2019s sales of natural gas and adversely affect NW Holdings\u2019 or NW Natural\u2019s results of operations because revenues are collected mostly through volumetric rates, based on the amount of gas sold. In Oregon, NW Natural has a conservation tariff which is designed to recover lost utility margin due to declines in residential and small commercial customers\u2019 consumption. However, NW Natural does not have a conservation tariff in Washington that provides it this margin protection on sales to customers in that state. Similar conservation risks exist for water utilities. Customers\u2019 conservation efforts may have a negative impact on NW Holding\u2019s and NW Natural\u2019s financial condition, revenues and results of operations.\nRisks Related Primarily to NW Holdings' Water Sector Businesses\nNEW WATER SECTOR BUSINESS. NW Holdings has entered the water sector through the acquisition of a number of water companies. Water businesses are subject to a number of risks in addition to the risks described above.\nAlthough the water businesses are not currently expected to materially contribute to the results of operations of NW Holdings, these businesses are subject to risks, in addition to those described above that could adversely affect their results of operations, including:\n\u2022\ncontamination of water supplies, including water provided to customers;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in water supplies and droughts;\n\u2022\nconservation efforts by customers;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions.\nSignificant losses, liabilities or impairments arising from these businesses may adversely affect NW Holdings' financial position or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 58334, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NWN"}
