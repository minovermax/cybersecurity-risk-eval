RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply may reduce our net sales and/or margins, which may cause us to incur losses or reduce our net income.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of building products are determined by overall supply and demand in the market. Market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical, and we have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes. Demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, interest rates, availability of mortgage financing, the construction, repair and remodeling markets, industrial markets, weather, and population growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products. To the extent that prices and volumes experience a sustained or sharp decline, our net sales and margins likely would decline as well. Because we have substantial fixed costs, a decrease in sales and margin generally may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many of the building products which we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber, and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other distributors or manufacturers, with prices and volumes determined frequently in an auction market based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. At times, the purchase price for any one or more of the products we produce or distribute may fall below our purchase costs, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales.\nAll of these factors make it difficult to forecast our operating results.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness, future indebtedness, or to maintain our required level of excess liquidity.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt which could have important consequences for us. For example, our substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our U.S. revolving credit facility and Tranche A Loan (together, the \u201cCredit Agreement,\u201d) is variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt, and therefore may be in a better position to obtain favorable credit terms.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows, and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and demand factors affecting the building products distribution industry;\n\u2022\nexternal factors affecting availability of credit;\n\u2022\npricing pressures;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions; and\n\u2022\nother operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, or restructure our debt. Obtaining additional capital or restructuring our debt could be accomplished in part through new or additional borrowings or placements of debt or securities. There is no assurance that we could obtain additional capital or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on the disposition of such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposition.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our operating subsidiaries\u2019 assets, including inventories, accounts receivable, and proceeds from those items, and are also secured by a second priority interest in the equity of our real estate subsidiaries which hold the real estate that secures our mortgage loan. Furthermore, the equity interest in all of our real estate subsidiaries which hold the real estate secured by our mortgage are subject to first and second priority interests in favor of our lenders, as applicable. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $176.2 million and excess availability of $63.5 million, based on qualifying inventory and accounts receivable, under the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, our mortgage loan is secured by the majority of our real property. As amended on March 24, 2016, our mortgage loan requires us to make a $27.2 million remaining principal payment (originally $60.0 million, reduced by $32.8 million of principal payments allocable during\nfiscal 2016) due no later than July 1, 2017, and a $55.0 million principal payment due no later than July 1, 2018, with the remainder of the mortgage due on July 1, 2019. Pursuant to the mortgage loan, and except as expressly permitted thereunder, the net proceeds from any mortgaged properties sold by us must be used to pay down mortgage principal, and these net proceeds will be included in the aforementioned principal payments. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to consummate any disposition of assets or obtain the net proceeds which we could realize from such disposition, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet the debt service obligations then due. In the event of our breach of the revolving credit facilities or our mortgage loan, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets or otherwise exercise their remedies with respect to such interests.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, including requiring us to maintain a minimum level of excess liquidity.\nOur revolving credit facilities and mortgage loan contain various restrictive covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants customary for asset-based loans that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental business changes.\nAs amended most recently on November 3, 2016, by the Thirteenth Amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement, the U.S. revolving credit facility loan limit was reduced by $15.0 million to $335.0 million, and the Tranche A Loan limit was reduced by $4.0 million to $16.0 million. Furthermore, the Amendment requires maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 in the event our excess availability falls below $32.5 million through March 31, 2017; and subsequently, the greater of a defined range, adjusted on a seasonal basis, of $36.0 million to $42.0 million and an amount equal to 12.5% of the lesser of (a) the sum of the borrowing base and the Tranche A Loan borrowing base or (b) the maximum credit. The Tranche A Loan limit shall be subject to automatic commitment reductions depending on the time of year, with the balance due and payable by July 15, 2018; provided, that all scheduled commitment reductions on or after August 1, 2017 will be subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including a minimum excess availability threshold of at least $50.0 million after giving effect to any such required payment. If a scheduled commitment reduction is prohibited due to not satisfying those conditions, the required excess availability covenant shall be increased by the amount of any such prohibited commitment reduction.\nIf we fail to comply with the minimum excess availability covenant discussed above, the Credit Agreement requires us to (i) maintain certain financial ratios, which we would not meet with current operating results, and (ii) limit our capital expenditures, which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the Credit Agreement, the mortgage loan documents, or any other current or future financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt, and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, many of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. Thus, trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs, quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions, as well as foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of the products available to us.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.\nWhile we operate our business out of 39 warehouse facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our warehouse facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, or by fire, adverse weather conditions, civil unrest, or other unexpected events or disruptions to our facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and operating results may be reduced.\nThe building and industrial products distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. Competitive factors in our industry include pricing, availability of product, service, delivery capabilities, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors for their products, and affects the favorability of the terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers.\nSome of our competitors are part of larger companies, and therefore may have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. In addition, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers. Additional manufacturers of products distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute directly to end-users in the future or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our costs at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and net income may be reduced.\nA significant percentage of our employees are unionized. Wage increases or work stoppages by our unionized employees may reduce our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,600 persons. Approximately 35% of our employees were represented by various local labor union collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d), of which approximately 10% of CBAs are up for renewal in fiscal 2017 or are currently expired and under negotiations.\nAlthough we have generally had good relations with our unionized employees, and expect to renew collective bargaining agreements as they expire, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to reach a timely agreement as to the renewal of the agreements, and their expiration or continued work under an expired agreement, as applicable, could result in a work stoppage. In addition, we may become subject to material cost increases, or additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions. The foregoing could increase our selling, general, and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future, which could adversely impact our net sales and/or selling, general, and administrative expenses. All of these factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in actuarial assumptions for our pension plan could impact our financial results, and funding requirements are mandated by the Federal government.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan. Most of the participants in our pension plan are inactive, with the majority of the remaining active participants no longer accruing benefits; and the pension plan is closed to new entrants. However, unfavorable changes in various assumptions underlying the pension benefit obligation could adversely impact our financial results. Significant assumptions include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, projected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. In addition, the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations are influenced by funding requirements that are established by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Pension Protection Act, Congressional Acts, or other governing bodies.\nCosts and liabilities related to our participation in multi-employer pension plans could increase.\nWe participate in various multi-employer pension plans in the U.S. based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements. Some of these plans are significantly underfunded and may require increased contributions in the future. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, governmental regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plan, the continued viability and contributions of other employers which contribute to the plan, and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability, among other factors.\nUnder current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of these multi-employer plans or trigger a partial withdrawal, we likely would need to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results. Additionally, a mass withdrawal would require us to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results, and would obligate us to payments in perpetuity to the particular plan.\nOne of the plans to which we are obligated to contribute is the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund. As of March 30, 2016, the plan\u2019s actuary certified that the plan was in critical and declining status, which, among other things, means the funded percentage of the plan was less than 65% and the plan is projected to become insolvent in 2025. It is unclear what will happen to this plan in the future. At a minimum, we expect that our required contributions to the plan may increase. In addition, if we experience a withdrawal from this plan, we may need to record a significant withdrawal liability. Our estimated withdrawal liability was $30.7 million if we had experienced a complete withdrawal from the plan during 2016. This number will likely increase if a withdrawal occurs in 2017 or later, and could be significantly higher if a mass withdrawal were to occur in the future.\nAffiliates of Cerberus control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders.\nCerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cCerberus\u201d), a private investment firm, beneficially owned approximately 52.2% of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. As a result, Cerberus is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. This concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that some of our stockholders may not view as beneficial.\nTwo of our seven directors are employees of or current advisors to Cerberus or its affiliates. Cerberus also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. The interests of Cerberus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, Cerberus is in the business of making investments in companies, and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus may also pursue, for its own account, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Cerberus continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, because we are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules, we are exempt from the NYSE requirements that our board be composed of a majority of independent directors, that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors, and that we maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe are subject to information technology security risks and business interruption risks, and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs information technology systems to secure confidential information, such as employee data. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. As cyber attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions, and/or obtain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant upon information technology systems to place orders with our vendors and process orders from our customers. Disruption in these systems could materially impact our ability to buy and sell our products.\nWe are subject to continuing compliance monitoring by the NYSE. If we do not continue to meet the NYSE continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE, and the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE is subject to our compliance with the listing standards. We are currently in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE; however, in 2015 and 2016 we were notified by the NYSE that we had failed to meet the NYSE\u2019s minimum average share price requirement and the NYSE\u2019s minimum average global market capitalization and stockholders\u2019 equity requirement. We have since regained compliance with each of those requirements. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common stock may be subject to delisting. Delisting may have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and, as a result, the market price for our common stock might decline.", "PERMNO": 90496, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "BXC"}
