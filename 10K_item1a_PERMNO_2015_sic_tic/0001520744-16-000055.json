{"cik": "1520744", "company": "Lumos Networks Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely impact our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business:\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic uncertainty or a lack of economic growth could negatively impact our business results. Unfavorable economic conditions, including a return to recession or disruptions to the credit and financial markets, could cause customers to slow or delay spending. If demand for our services decreases, our revenues would be adversely affected and churn may increase. In addition, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which may impair the ability of our customers to pay for services they have purchased. Any of the above could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide services or to which we outsource certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect our customers could also adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in quality or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. Any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to grow our data business and thereby sustain our revenue and cash flow growth.\nWe must grow our data business and manage the decline in our legacy businesses in order to sustain our revenue and cash flow growth. We have pursued several growth initiatives including:\n\u00b7\nInvesting in a comprehensive network expansion into the Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA area;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing network investments in our core markets;\n\u00b7\nInvesting in fiber network expansion into new adjacent geographic markets;\n\u00b7\nBuilding fiber to wireless carrier cell sites; and\n\u00b7\nLaunching new products and services that meet customers\u2019 data and IP needs.\nOur ability to manage this expansion depends on many factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nAttract new customers and sell additional services to existing customers by effectively implementing our sales and marketing plans;\n\u00b7\nManage churn through successful implementation of our customer retention programs and upgrading existing customers from time division multiplexing (\u201cTDM\u201d) products to advanced Ethernet services;\n\u00b7\nOffset our revenue declines from churn in our legacy voice and access segments and within our data segment resulting from customers TDM product replacement;\n\u00b7\nComplete customer installations in a timely manner to meet customer demands;\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully train our sales force to adapt to evolutionary demand for advanced data service;\n\u00b7\nEfficiently manage our capital expansion plans;\n\u00b7\nObtain capital necessary to implement our growth plans;\n\u00b7\nManage increased competition from other data service providers in existing and new markets; and\n\u00b7\nRemain competitive with customer pricing and service expectations.\nWe may be unable to successfully divest legacy businesses on a timely basis, which would hinder our strategy of accelerating our transformation to a pure play fiber bandwidth infrastructure company, and divestitures we do complete could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we consider the divestiture of legacy businesses based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business. Divesting certain of our products or assets would be complex operationally due to their interrelationships with products and assets we would desire to retain. Any divestiture also would have implications under our Credit Facility and 8% Notes. The inability to divest legacy businesses on a timely basis would hinder our strategy of accelerating our transformation to a pure play fiber bandwidth infrastructure company. Additionally, decisions to divest certain business operations could involve realization of losses, transition and wind-up expenses and the elimination of revenues along with associated costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our strategic growth plan, and if we fail to obtain this capital, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur strategic growth plans require a significant amount of capital investment in fiber operations through organic and/or inorganic growth. Additionally, to remain competitive, we will need to continue to upgrade the technical requirements of our existing network infrastructure and build out our network with advanced fiber technology within our territories which will require a significant investment of capital resources. Additionally, the cost or extent of the work required for organic growth projects could be more significant than anticipated. Any such unplanned capital expenditures may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that the cash we generate from operations combined with our cash on hand and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we have access to a revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. However, if our assumptions prove incorrect or if there are other factors that increase our need for additional liquidity, such as material unanticipated losses, loss of customers or a significant reduction in demand for our services or other factors, or if we are successful in obtaining additional major FTTC contracts or we make acquisitions, we would expect to seek additional sources of funds through refinancing or other means including additional equity financing. There is no assurance that we could obtain such additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If available, additional equity financing may dilute our stockholders and debt financing may restrict our ability to raise future capital.\nWe may not be able to complete acquisitions and acquisitions we do complete could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other adverse consequences, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe evaluate potential strategic transactions in order to pursue our strategy. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to one or more of such transactions that may be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any such discussions will result in the consummation of any transaction or that we will identify appropriate transactions on terms acceptable to us. Adverse capital markets and volatility in our stock price could also negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions.\nFuture acquisitions may result in the dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions also may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to employee costs, integration costs, unexpected liabilities and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. Any of these items could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face substantial competition in our markets; our competitors may have substantial business advantages over us and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with ILECs, broadband service providers, incumbent cable operators, fiber companies and to a lesser extent, CLECs. As a result of the rapid growth in demand for broadband data, we expect that our competition will increase from market entrants offering FTTC, metro Ethernet solutions and other high-speed data services, including cable and wireless access. Our competition includes ILECs, such as AT&T, Verizon, Frontier, Windstream and Centurylink; national fiber service providers and CLECs, including Level 3 and Zayo, and national and regional cable operators, such as Comcast, Shentel, Cox, Time Warner Cable and Suddenlink. In addition, due to consolidation and strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry, we cannot predict the number of competitors that will emerge. Such increased competition from existing and new entities could lead to price reductions, loss of customers, reduced operating margins and/or loss of market share.\nMany of our competitors have financial resources, corporate backing, customer bases, marketing programs and brand names that are greater than ours. Additionally, competitors may charge less than we do for services, causing us to reduce, or preventing us from raising, our fees.\nNetwork delays or interruptions of service could cause us to lose customers.\nTo be successful, we must provide our customers reliable network service. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include: physical damage to outside plant facilities, power surges or outages; network equipment failures due to aging or other factors; software defects; human error; disruptions beyond our control, including disruptions caused by terrorist activities or severe weather; and failures in operational support systems.\nFurthermore, as the demand for increased bandwidth from our customers has grown and as it continues to grow, our fiber optic network could experience greater data loads that may also result in network interruptions in service and reduced capacity for our customers. Service interruptions and lack of redundancy could cause us to incur additional expenses and/or issue network outage credits to our customers and may cause us to lose customers.\nThe telecommunications industry is generally characterized by rapid development and introduction of new technologies; if we are unable to adapt to these rapid changes, we could suffer price reductions, customer losses, reduced operating margins and/or loss of market share.\nThe telecommunications industry continues to experience rapid and significant changes in technologies and architectures to deliver new services to customers and to deliver existing services more cost-effectively. We expect that new technologies will continue to enable advances in our customers\u2019 environments that create new demand drivers. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to the rapidly changing needs and demands of our customers on a timely basis and to compete with our competitors' offerings. Our failure to obtain and integrate new technologies and applications, and develop new service offerings to meet those customer needs or to keep pace with or exceed the service capabilities of our competitors could impact the breadth of our service portfolio, resulting in less competitive and compelling offerings that could impair our ability to attract and retain customers. We may be unable to keep pace with competitive offerings without making significant additional capital investments or adversely affecting our margins.\nRevenue from certain of our more traditional products such as dedicated network services and certain voice services is growing slowly or is declining. As a result, our overall revenue growth is driven primarily by our Ethernet services and we must continue to develop those and other next generation services in order to continue to grow our revenue. New product development may be capital intensive and may pressure margins until the new products begin to generate substantial revenue. New products that are largely software based are increasingly complex and may require more customer support and additional systems development. In addition to investing in new technologies, we must replace equipment that supports our traditional services as that equipment ages or becomes redundant. If we do not properly manage this process, including the migration of customers to our newer technologies, we may lose customers and market share, and our margins and returns could be adversely affected.\nLosses or a decrease in usage from certain key customers may result in lower revenues or higher expenses.\nWe generated approximately 32% of our operating revenue from our six largest carrier customers in the year ended December 31, 2015. No single customer currently represents more than 10% of our operating revenues. If we were to lose one or more of these carrier customers, our revenues would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have to undertake further restructuring plans which would require additional charges.\nFrom time to time we have incurred restructuring charges as a result of changes in our business strategy, most recently in the first quarter of 2016. We plan to continue to evaluate our business, which may result in additional restructuring activities. We may choose to implement workforce reductions, outsource certain functions or consolidate or close certain facilities. Decisions to engage in future restructuring activities could involve realization of losses, wind-up expenses, workforce reductions, impairment of assets and the elimination of revenues along with associated costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position.\nLumos Networks Operating Company, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has a credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) which consists of senior secured term loans and a senior secured revolving credit facility. Our indebtedness under the Credit Facility was $348.4 million at December 31, 2015 and it carries interest expense of approximately $12 million annually.\nOn August 6, 2015, we issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes due 2022 (the \u201c8% Notes\u201d) to an entity formed by Pamplona Capital Management, LLP (together with another entity formed by Pamplona Capital Management, LLP that acquired\nwarrants to purchase our common stock, the \u201cPamplona Entities\u201d). Our 8% Notes carry interest expense of approximately $12 million annually.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and business and future operations by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nLimiting our ability to obtain any additional financing we may need to operate, develop and expand our business;\n\u00b7\nMaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions by making it more difficult for us to react quickly to changing conditions;\n\u00b7\nRequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations to service our debt, which reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nPotentially making us more highly leveraged than our competitors, which could potentially decrease our ability to compete in our industry;\n\u00b7\nExposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates; and\n\u00b7\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate.\nThe ability to make payments on our debt will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If the cash flows from our subsidiaries\u2019 operating activities are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may take actions, such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, attempting to restructure or refinance our debt, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital. Any or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner or at all.\nOur Credit Facility and our 8% Notes impose certain operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nOur Credit Facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on our subsidiaries. These restrictions generally:\n\u00b7\nRestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nRestrict our subsidiaries from entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nRestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets;\n\u00b7\nImpose financial covenants relating to the business of our subsidiaries, including leverage and interest coverage ratios;\n\u00b7\nRequire our subsidiaries to use a portion of \u201cexcess cash flow\u201d (as defined in the debt agreement) to repay indebtedness if our leverage ratio exceeds specified levels; and\n\u00b7\nRestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to agree to liens on assets or agreements (such as leases).\nOur 8% Notes also impose certain financial and operating restrictions. These restrictions generally:\n\u00b7\nRestrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; and\n\u00b7\nRestrict our ability to agree to liens.\nWe cannot provide assurance that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default with respect to the Credit Facility or the 8% Notes, as applicable. If a default occurs, our indebtedness under the Credit Facility or the 8% Notes, as applicable, could be declared immediately due and payable.\nOur RLEC subsidiaries are subject to competition and to regulatory regimes at the state and federal level and consequently face substantial regulatory burdens and uncertainties; regulatory developments will further reduce revenues that we receive from access charges and/or from the federal Universal Service Fund, the Connect America Fund or other fund allocations.\nOur RLECs qualify as rural local telephone companies under the Telecommunications Act and are, therefore, exempt from many of the most burdensome obligations of the Telecommunications Act, such as the obligation to sell unbundled elements of our network to our competitors at \u201cforward-looking\u201d prices that the Telecommunications Act places on larger carriers. Nevertheless, our RLECs face significant competition, particularly from competitors that do not need to rely on access to our network to reach their customers. Wireless carriers, cable companies and other VoIP providers are able to compete with our RLECs even though the \u201crural exemption\u201d\nunder the Telecommunications Act is in place. If our rural exemption were removed, CLECs could more easily enter our RLECs\u2019 markets. Moreover, the regulatory environment governing wireline local operations has been, and we believe will likely continue to be, very liberal in its approach to promoting competition and network access.\nOver time, FCC and state regulations have resulted in reducing the switched access and reciprocal compensation revenue of our RLECs. In 2011, the FCC released an order comprehensively reforming interstate and intrastate intercarrier compensation systems. In the order, the FCC determined that interstate and intrastate access charges, as well as local reciprocal compensation, should be eliminated entirely over time. These FCC pricing reductions commenced on July 1, 2012 and continue through July 1, 2020. A portion of the access revenue previously received by our RLECs from carriers is being recovered through payments from the FCC\u2019s \u201cConnect America Fund\u201d (\u201cCAF\u201d) and from increases in charges to end user subscribers in the form of rate increases and the FCC\u2019s \u201cAccess Recovery Charge.\u201d Regulatory changes could impact the amount and timing of the revenues received from these funds in the future. There is no guarantee that we will recover all or a portion of lost revenues resulting from intercarrier compensation system reform or that we will not be subject to further rate reductions in the future. Furthermore, by accepting government funding, we are subject to audit by the FCC or certain other government agencies that administer the funds and our methodologies or approaches taken to determine the amounts of eligible access revenues or costs, as applicable, could be called into question during an audit. Although we believe our methodologies and approaches are compliant and reasonable, there is no assurance that an audit would not result in a demand for a partial refund or nonpayment of future funding by the respective government agency.\nLumos Networks and other industry participants are frequently involved in disputes over issues that, if decided adversely to us, could harm our financial and operational prospects.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to be subject to risks associated with the resolution of various disputes, lawsuits, arbitrations and proceedings affecting our business. These issues may include, among other things, the administration and enforcement of existing interconnection agreements and tariffs, the terms of new interconnection agreements, operating performance obligations and intercarrier compensation. We also may be included in proceedings and arbitrations before state and regulatory commissions, private arbitration organizations, and courts over many issues that will be important to our financial and operation success. While we believe we have adequate reserves for the probable and estimable losses related to the expected outcomes of our current disputes, the results of these disputes are inherently unpredictable.\nThe implementation of our business strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain, expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to growth and changing business needs.\nOur business relies on our data, billing and other operational and financial reporting and business systems. To effectively implement our business strategy, we will need to continue to maintain and, in some cases, make upgrades to modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure, which can be costly. Our inability to maintain, expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include service or billing interruptions, the diversion of critical resources and inhibiting our growth plans due to an inability to scale effectively.\nWe are dependent on third-party vendors for our information and billing systems. Any significant disruption in our relationship with these vendors could increase our costs and affect our operating efficiencies.\nSophisticated information and billing systems are vital to our ability to monitor and control costs, bill customers, process customer orders, provide customer service and achieve operating efficiencies. We currently rely on a mix of internal systems and third-party supported applications and systems to provide all of our information and data processing needs. Some of our billing, customer service and management information systems have been developed by third parties and may not perform as anticipated or the third parties may experience interruptions or other problems delivering these systems. In addition, our plans for developing and implementing our information and billing systems rely to some extent on the delivery of products and services by third-party vendors. Our right to use these systems is dependent upon license agreements with third-party vendors. Some of these agreements are cancelable by the vendor, and the cancellation or nonrenewable nature of these agreements could impair our ability to process customer information and/or bill our customers. Since we rely on third-party vendors to provide some of these services, any switch in vendors could be costly and affect operating efficiencies.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of the products and services we require to operate our businesses successfully.\nWe depend on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components and related software on a timely basis, our subscriber growth and operating results could suffer significantly. Our initial choice of a network infrastructure supplier can, where proprietary technology of the supplier is an integral component of the network, cause us effectively to be locked into one or a few suppliers for key network components. As a result, we have become reliant upon a limited number of network equipment\nmanufacturers, including Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Ciena and others. If alternative suppliers and vendors become necessary, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory and timely replacement supplies on economically attractive terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor union when they expire, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe are a party to collective bargaining agreements with our labor union, which represented 43 employees as of December 31, 2015. Although we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our union arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have an adverse effect to the business. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally renegotiated every three years and the current agreements expire June 30, 2017.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain necessary construction permits, rights-of-way and access to pole attachments for our network, our operations may be interrupted, customer installations may be delayed and we would likely face increased costs.\nWe need to obtain and maintain the necessary rights-of-way for our network from governmental and quasi-governmental entities and third parties, such as railroads, utilities, state highway authorities, local governments, transit authorities and private landowners. Additionally, in many cases we require construction permits to complete fiber installations. We may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining these rights-of-way or construction permits or obtaining them on acceptable terms. Some agreements relating to rights-of-way may be short-term or revocable at will, and we cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to existing rights-of-way after the governing agreements are terminated or expire. If any of our right-of-way agreements were terminated or could not be renewed, we may be forced to remove our network facilities from the affected areas, relocate or abandon our networks. This would interrupt our operations and force us to find alternative rights-of-way and make unexpected capital expenditures. If we are unable to obtain construction permits in a timely manner, or at all, we could face delays in fiber installations, incur unexpected cost for network redesign work, or default on customer contracts. In addition, our failure to maintain the necessary rights-of-way, franchises, easements, licenses and permits may result in an event of default under our credit agreement and may subject us to legal complaints or claims. We may also incur costs resulting from a disruption of service or the relocation of equipment for other carriers that use our network under Indefeasible Rights to Use (\u201cIRU\u201d) arrangements granted by us.\nUnder federal law, we have a right to use the poles, ducts, and conduits of investor-owned utilities (electric and telephone) at regulated rates for our cables, including fiber optic facilities. Some of the poles we use are exempt from federal regulation because they are owned by utility cooperatives and municipal entities. If the rates, terms and conditions imposed by utilities are unreasonable, or if the utilities do not allow us access to the poles, ducts, and conduits in a timely manner, our business, financial results or financial condition could suffer.\nOur rights to the use of fiber that are part of our network may be affected by the ability to continue long term contracts and the financial stability of our IRU fiber providers.\nA portion of our services are provided on network fiber facilities licensed or leased from other network service providers through IRUs or similar arrangements. The facilities under these agreements have remaining terms generally ranging from less than 1 year to 24 years. In these agreements, the network owner is responsible for network maintenance for which we pay such network owners. If our network provider under IRU agreements has financial troubles, it could adversely affect our costs, especially maintenance costs and ability to deliver service. Also, if our network providers under IRU agreements are unable to obtain and maintain necessary rights-of-way and access to pole attachments for their fiber networks or if they fail to renew or extend our IRUs, our operations may be interrupted and/or we could incur material expenses if we were required to relocate to alternative network assets.\nWe are dependent upon interconnection agreements with other carriers to reach some of our customer locations.\nWe have interconnection agreements with ILECs in the competitive markets we serve. Based on existing customers and our assessment of growth opportunities in these markets, we purchase wholesale voice lines, data circuits and access to collocation facilities under these agreements. From time to time, we are required to negotiate amendments to, extensions of, or replacements for these agreements. Additionally, we may be required to negotiate new interconnection agreements in order to enter new markets in the future. We may not be able to successfully negotiate amendments to existing agreements, negotiate new interconnection agreements, renew our existing interconnection agreements, opt in to new agreements or successfully arbitrate replacement agreements for interconnection on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Our inability to do so would adversely affect our existing operations and opportunities to expand our business in existing and new markets. If rates became unfavorable or we could no longer access collocation facilities, we could be forced to alter our service delivery which could reduce our customer base. As the FCC modifies and implements rules related to unbundling of ILEC network elements and collocation of competitive facilities at ILEC central offices, we generally have to renegotiate our interconnection agreements to implement those new or modified rules.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\nOur Credit Facility exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. We cannot predict whether interest rates for long-term debt will increase, and thus we cannot assure you that our future interest expense will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our interest rate swap contracts, which partially mitigated this exposure, expired on December 31, 2015.\nSecurity breaches to our physical facilities, computer networks, and informational databases, and unauthorized use of, or interference with, our network could disrupt services and result in loss of customer data and customers, and increase our costs.\nThe nature of our business necessitates that parts of our network remain in the public domain and as a result it is possible that unauthorized use, interference with, or malicious or unintentional disruptions of our network may occur. In addition, computer viruses, theft, attacks by hackers, or similar disruptive problems may occur. If hackers gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential personal information concerning our subscribers.\nIn addition, misuse of our customer information could result in more substantial harm perpetrated by third parties. This could damage our business and reputation, and result in a loss of customers. Misuse of our customer information would also subject us to fines by the FCC. We may incur costs associated with the unauthorized use of our network including administrative and capital costs associated with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidence of malice and fraud. Malicious and fraudulent use of our network may impact interconnection costs, capacity costs, legal and administrative costs, fraud prevention costs and payments to other carriers for fraudulent use.\nOur physical facilities may be vulnerable to physical break-ins which may also result in the misuse of our customer information, malicious and fraudulent use of our networks that may impact interconnection costs, capacity costs, legal and administrative costs, fraud prevention costs and payments to other carriers for fraudulent use.\nIf or when we lose a member or members of our senior management, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and management personnel, including talented sales and technical personnel.\nWe believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for qualified personnel in the telecommunications industry, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. The unexpected loss of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny significant impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in net income.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $111.4 million (approximately 14.9% of total assets). If the impact or the timing of ongoing regulatory reform actions is significantly different than what we anticipate or if there are other regulatory or operating changes to our business, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and reduction in net income. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset and the implied fair value of the asset in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about the fair values of our reporting units. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future reporting unit operating performance, existing or new product market acceptance, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key fair value assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and our future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value of one or more of the indefinite-lived intangible assets or of the reporting units, resulting in an additional impairment charge.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock:\nOutstanding warrants may cause dilution to existing shareholders.\nOn August 6, 2015, we issued to a Pamplona entity a warrant to purchase up to 5,500,000 shares of our common stock (the \u201cWarrant\u201d). The Warrant is exercisable on a cashless basis at an initial exercise price of $13.99 per share and may be net-share settled only. Exercise of the Warrant may cause dilution to the interests of other stockholders as a result of the additional common stock that would be issued. Additionally, the Warrant contains anti- dilution provisions that could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nThe Pamplona Entities have influence over our business and their interests may not always coincide with the interests of the holders of our common stock.\nTwo of our 11 current directors that serve on our board of directors (and two of the nine directors who will be nominated for election at our 2016 Annual Meeting) are representatives or designees of the Pamplona Entities pursuant to an Investors Rights Agreement between a Pamplona Entity and us. By virtue of the Investors Rights Agreement and such representation on the board of directors, the Pamplona Entities have influence over corporate and management policies and matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of the directors.\nThe interest of the Pamplona Entities may not always coincide with the interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, because the Pamplona Entities have influence over our business, they could seek to influence us to enter into transactions or agreements adverse to the interests of our stockholders or to forego entering into transactions or agreements that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, the Pamplona Entities are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in business that compete directly or indirectly with us.
