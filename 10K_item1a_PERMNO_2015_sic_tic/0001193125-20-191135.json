RISK FACTORS\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. As a result, investing in the Company\u2019s common stock involves substantial risk. The Company\u2019s stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, as well as the other information we file with the SEC from time to time. If any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain statements made in this section constitute \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those described in this section. Refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within this Annual Report for additional information.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur current business is highly dependent on the United capacity purchase agreement, since United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner.\nWe derive nearly all of our operating revenue from the United capacity purchase agreement because United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. United accounted for approximately 99.9% and 97.2% of our operating revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The termination or non-renewal of the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe United capacity purchase agreement expires in February 2023, unless United elects to exercise its option to extend the agreement for an additional two-year period, in which case it expires in February 2025, unless United elects to exercise its second option to extend the agreement for a second additional two-year period, subject to mutual agreement on certain economic terms, in which case it expires in February 2027. United is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, including giving notice of 60 days or more, to terminate the agreement early in the event of Air Wisconsin\u2019s material breach of the agreement, subject to Air Wisconsin\u2019s right to cure.\nThe United capacity purchase agreement is also subject to termination prior to expiration in various circumstances, including if Air Wisconsin\u2019s controllable flight completion factor or departure performance falls below certain pre-determined levels, and in the event of a non-carrier-specific grounding of at least a specified number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, in each case for a specified period of time. Air Wisconsin currently uses the systems, facilities and services of United to support a significant portion of its operations, including airport and terminal facilities and operations, information technology interface, ticketing and reservations, scheduling, dispatching interface, fuel purchasing and ground handling services. If United were to cease to maintain any of these systems, close any of these facilities, or no longer provide these services to Air Wisconsin, whether due to termination of the United capacity purchase agreement, a strike or other labor interruption by United personnel, bankruptcy or other financial hardship experienced by United, or for any other reason, Air Wisconsin may not be able to obtain access to alternative systems, facilities or services on terms and conditions as favorable as those it currently receives, or at all. Upon certain termination events described in the United capacity purchase agreement, United could require Air Wisconsin to sell or assign to United certain facilities and assets that Air Wisconsin uses in connection with the services it provides. As a result, in order to offer airline service after termination of the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin may have to replace these facilities, assets and services. Air Wisconsin may be unable to arrange such replacements on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nIf the United capacity purchase agreement were to be terminated or not renewed, our business would be significantly impacted, and it is unlikely we would have an immediate source of revenue or earnings to offset the financial impact. United is not under any obligation to extend or renew the United capacity purchase agreement with Air Wisconsin, whether on similar terms or at all. The United capacity purchase agreement permits United to\nterminate the agreement upon certain changes of control of Air Wisconsin, which could limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pursue certain acquisitions, sales or other corporate transactions. A termination or expiration of this agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to satisfy debt and lease obligations, unless we are able to enter into satisfactory substitute arrangements for the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft and spare engines. We may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements, and any arrangements we are able to secure may not be as favorable to us as the current agreement.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on the business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity of United, which is Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, and the duration and spread of the pandemic could result in additional adverse impacts to United, or cause it to declare bankruptcy, which may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be negatively impacted.\nWe may be directly affected by the financial and operating performance of United, which is Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. Any events that negatively impact the financial or operating performance of United, including, but not limited to, the impacts of the reduction in passenger flight demand due to pandemics or other widespread outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. United has experienced significant decline in flight demand related to COVID-19 during the first half of 2020 and a resulting material deterioration in United\u2019s revenue for the first half of 2020. This reduction in demand is expected to continue, and United expects its results of operations to be materially impacted through 2021. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global passenger flight demand and United\u2019s financial and operational performance, United may be unable to make payments due to Air Wisconsin under the United capacity purchase agreement in a timely manner or at all. Any failure by United to make timely payments due to Air Wisconsin may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if United were to become bankrupt, the United capacity purchase agreement may not be assumed in bankruptcy and could be terminated, and such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on United\u2019s, and therefore, on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including the effectiveness of United\u2019s mitigation strategies, the duration and spread of COVID-19 and resulting impact on the financial health and operations of United\u2019s and Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners, and future governmental actions in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIf United provides Air Wisconsin with inefficient flight schedules, or makes certain changes to the expected utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, United has the ability, subject to certain reasonable operating constraints, to schedule Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in any manner that serves United\u2019s purposes. These reasonable operating constraints do not prevent United from scheduling Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights inefficiently for Air Wisconsin. From time to time, United has scheduled Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in a manner which creates operational inefficiencies for Air Wisconsin, such as by building in long crew layovers or overnights, or by providing Air Wisconsin with flight schedules that are inconsistent with Air Wisconsin\u2019s existing operational footprint. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nThere are also certain factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that have led, and may in the future lead, United to modify the anticipated utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, some of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control. Any factors that cause United to schedule the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft on routes or at frequencies materially different than we have forecasted could reduce our ability to realize operating efficiencies, which would negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\nDisagreements regarding the interpretation of the United capacity purchase agreement, as well as other business disputes with United, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, and negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s relationship with United.\nLong-term contractual agreements, such as the United capacity purchase agreement, are subject to interpretation, and disputes may arise if the parties apply different interpretations to the agreements. Currently, a dispute between United and Air Wisconsin exists under the United capacity purchase agreement with respect to certain amounts owed to Air Wisconsin and with respect to United\u2019s failure to schedule the covered aircraft in accordance with the minimum scheduling parameters contained in the agreement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to resolve these ongoing disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. To the extent Air Wisconsin experiences additional disagreements regarding the interpretation of the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin may expend valuable management time and financial resources in its efforts to resolve those disagreements. Those disagreements may result in litigation, arbitration, settlement negotiations or other proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these disputes, or any related negotiations, on the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement or our relationship with United. An unfavorable result could require Air Wisconsin to modify the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, or change its business strategy, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, regardless of the final outcome of any dispute or disagreement, the existence of a dispute with United could harm Air Wisconsin\u2019s relationship with United, which could impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to renew or expand the relationship.\nThe amounts Air Wisconsin receives under the United capacity purchase agreement may be less than the corresponding costs Air Wisconsin incurs.\nUnder the United capacity purchase agreement, a portion of the revenue Air Wisconsin receives is based upon predetermined rates determined by reference to certain factors, such as the number of covered aircraft, the number of block hours flown and the number of departures. The primary operating costs intended to be compensated by the predetermined rates include labor costs, including salaries and benefits, training costs, crew room costs, maintenance expenses, simulator and spare parts costs and overhead costs. If Air Wisconsin\u2019s costs for those items exceed the compensation paid at the rates set in the United capacity purchase agreement, our financial position and operating results will be negatively affected.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s current growth opportunities and future growth opportunities may be limited by a number of factors impacting the airline industry, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGrowth opportunities within United\u2019s current flight systems may be limited by various factors, including \u201cscope\u201d clauses in United\u2019s current collective bargaining agreements with its pilots that restrict the number and size of regional aircraft that may be operated in its flight systems that are not flown by its pilots. Although United currently has significant room under its scope clauses with respect to 50-seat aircraft, which currently comprise Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, these clauses could limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to operate larger aircraft for United which would limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s expansion opportunities. United is under no obligation to provide Air Wisconsin with an opportunity to fly additional aircraft within its system or to otherwise expand its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nFurther, Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to expand its operations in the future may be limited by a number of factors impacting the airline industry, including access to airport terminals and facilities, terms of United\u2019s collective bargaining agreements limiting the usage of regional carriers, required capital expenditures to maintain or expand fleet operations, significant changes in variable costs, regulatory changes, changes in the availability of necessary parts and equipment, and intense competition and pricing pressure. Given the competitive nature of the airline industry, and the excess capacity in the industry due to the significantly depressed passenger demand for air travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe limited growth opportunities exist. In order to take advantage of these opportunities, to the extent and in the event that passenger demand for air travel rebounds, Air Wisconsin may be required to accept less favorable contract terms in order to secure new or additional flying opportunities. Due to the significant decline in passenger demand for air travel and the resulting economic disruption, there may not be any new or additional flying opportunities available to Air Wisconsin. In addition, even if Air Wisconsin is offered these growth opportunities in the future, they may involve economic terms or financing commitments that are unfavorable to Air Wisconsin or do not result in profitable operations.\nAir Wisconsin currently operates only one aircraft type, and relies on one aircraft manufacturer and one engine manufacturer, and any operating restrictions or safety concerns applicable to this aircraft or engine type, or any failure to receive sufficient maintenance and support services from these manufacturers, would negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin currently relies on a single aircraft type, the CRJ-200 regional jet, and a single engine type, the GE CF34-3B1 engine. The issuance of FAA or manufacturer directives restricting or prohibiting the use of this aircraft type or engine type would negatively impact our business and financial results. In addition, any concerns raised regarding the safety or reliability of the CRJ-200 regional jet or the GE CF34-3B1 engine, whether or not directly associated with Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, could result in concerns about Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet that could negatively impact our business.\nAir Wisconsin has been highly dependent upon Bombardier, as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, and GE, as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft engines, to provide sufficient parts or related maintenance and support services to it in a timely manner. Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of Mitsubishi, as Bombardier\u2019s successor in ownership of the CRJ-200 program, or GE to provide required maintenance or support services, or the interruption of Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft or engines. On June 1, 2020, Bombardier consummated an agreement with Mitsubishi, pursuant to which Mitsubishi purchased Bombardier\u2019s regional jet program, including all aspects of the CRJ-200 regional jet, including type certificates, maintenance, support, refurbishment, marketing and sales activities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, the closing of this transaction may have on Mitsubishi\u2019s continued support of the CRJ-200 regional jet or Air Wisconsin\u2019s continued ability to obtain required parts and services.\nAdditionally, GE Aviation recently announced, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, that it would lay off a significant percentage of its workforce. We cannot predict what effect these layoffs will have on the availability of parts and services to Air Wisconsin from the manufacturer of its aircraft engines.\nAir Wisconsin has a significant amount of debt and other contractual obligations that could impair its liquidity and ability to obtain additional financing and, in the event Air Wisconsin is unable to repay its debt and other contractual obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nThe airline business is capital intensive and, as a result, Air Wisconsin is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2019, Air Wisconsin had approximately $120.7 million (including capitalized interest of $16.5 million) in total third-party current and long-term debt, which was incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition of aircraft, and which is secured by substantially all of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, engines and parts. During Air Wisconsin\u2019s year ended December 31, 2019, its principal third-party debt service payments totaled $7.0 million. For future annual cash obligations relating to third-party debt, see the section entitled \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis - Commitments and Capital Obligations\u201d within this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Air Wisconsin held 13 aircraft pursuant to operating leases, with an average remaining term of less than one year. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft operating lease payments totaled approximately $26.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, future minimum lease payments due under all operating leases were approximately $20.0 million. For future annual cash obligations relating to all operating leases, see the section entitled \u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis - Commitments and Capital Obligations\u201d within this Annual Report. In January 2020, the Company acquired ownership of three aircraft which were previously leased by Air Wisconsin from Southshore. In May 2020, Air Wisconsin acquired ownership of eight of its leased aircraft from the lessor. As a result, as of May 31, 2020, Air Wisconsin had two aircraft under lease with an average remaining term of less than one year, and future minimum lease payments due under all operating leases were approximately $10.3 million.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to various covenants under its financing agreements and leases. Its ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control. Air Wisconsin\u2019s failure to comply with obligations under these credit facilities could result in an event of default under the facilities. A default, if not cured or waived, could permit the lender to accelerate payment of the loans. In addition, the lender would have the right to proceed against the collateral security granted to a trustee for its benefit, which consists of substantially all of the aircraft, engines and parts owned by Air Wisconsin. If this debt is accelerated, we cannot be certain that Air Wisconsin will have funds available to pay the debt or that it will have the ability to refinance the debt on terms favorable to it, or at all. If Air Wisconsin could not repay or refinance the accelerated debt, it could be insolvent and could seek to file for bankruptcy protection. In addition, the Payroll Support Program Agreement (the \u201cPSP Agreement\u201d) that Air Wisconsin entered into in April 2020 with the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to the recently enacted federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCares Act\u201d) contains various covenants. If Air Wisconsin fails to comply with its obligations under the PSP Agreement, it may be required to repay the funds provided to it under that agreement. Any such default, acceleration, insolvency or failure to comply would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. See the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Debt and Credit Facilities\u201d within this Annual Report for more information.\nWe cannot be certain that Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations will generate sufficient cash flow to make its required payments under its debt and other contractual arrangements. Air Wisconsin currently does not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of its outstanding debt in full if such debt were accelerated. If Air Wisconsin is unable to pay its debts as they come due, or is unable to obtain waivers for such payments, its secured lenders could foreclose on any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s assets securing such debt. Additionally, a failure to pay Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, engine and other property leases, debt or other fixed cost obligations, or a breach of its other contractual obligations, could result in a variety of further adverse consequences, including the exercise of remedies by its creditors and lessors, such as acceleration. In such a situation, Air Wisconsin may not be able to cure its breach, fulfill its contractual obligations, make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Air Wisconsin is unable to source financing on acceptable terms, or at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. To the extent Air Wisconsin finances its activities with additional debt, it would become subject to additional debt service obligations, as well as additional covenants that may restrict its ability to pursue its business strategy or otherwise constrain its growth and operations. Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay the high level of fixed costs associated with operating a regional airline will therefore depend on its operating performance, cash flows and ability to secure adequate financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of its current business strategy, availability and cost of financing, as well as general economic and political conditions and other factors that are, to some extent, beyond its control. Such factors include pandemics and the outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets.\nA significant portion of Air Wisconsin\u2019s workforce is represented by labor unions and the terms of Air Wisconsin\u2019s collective bargaining agreements may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results.\nAs of May 31, 2020, 1,057 of Air Wisconsin\u2019s employees were represented by labor unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\u201cALPA\u201d), the Association of Flight Attendants (\u201cAFA\u201d), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers AFL-CIO (\u201cIAMAW\u201d), and the Transport Workers Union of America. In November 2019, Air Wisconsin\u2019s pilots, represented by ALPA, ratified a new three-year extension to the collective bargaining agreement. Similarly, in September 2018 and November 2018, Air Wisconsin reached an agreement with the technical stores clerks and dispatchers with new amendable dates of September 20, 2022 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The terms and conditions of future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency, or other factors, to bear higher costs than Air Wisconsin, which may result in higher industry wages and increased pressure on Air Wisconsin to increase the wages and benefits of its employees. Future agreements with represented employees may be on terms that are less favorable to Air Wisconsin than its current agreements or not comparable to agreements entered into by its competitors. Moreover, we cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements. Any agreements reached in collective bargaining may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its mechanics and related employees, who are represented by the IAMAW, has been amendable since October 2015 and is in mediated negotiation under the auspices of the NMB. Air Wisconsin\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its flight attendants who are represented by the AFA has been amendable since June 2016, and Air Wisconsin has been engaged in mediated negotiations with the AFA during such period. If Air Wisconsin is unable to reach agreement with any of its unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, it may be subject to work interruptions, stoppages or shortages.\nMaintenance costs will likely increase as the age of Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet increases.\nThe average age of Air Wisconsin\u2019s CRJ-200 regional jets as of December 31, 2019 was approximately 17.3 years. As Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet continues to age, its maintenance costs may increase, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our operating expenses. Certain significant maintenance activities required by Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft as they age result in out-of-service periods during which aircraft are dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable for flying under the United capacity purchase agreement. Any unexpected increase in Air Wisconsin\u2019s maintenance costs as its fleet ages, or decreased revenue resulting from out-of-service periods, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nAir Wisconsin may experience disruption in service with any of its key third-party service providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s reliance upon outside vendors to provide essential services critical to its operations may limit its ability to control the efficiency and timeliness of these contracted services. Air Wisconsin\u2019s agreements with service providers are generally subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events and, in a few cases, at the convenience of the provider. If Air Wisconsin\u2019s third-party service providers terminate their contracts with it, experience bankruptcy or other financial hardship, or do not provide timely or consistently high-quality service for any reason, Air Wisconsin may not be able to replace them in a timely or cost-efficient manner, which could result in it experiencing increased costs, service delays, or maintenance issues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory changes or tariffs could increase the costs and timing of necessary parts and aircraft and negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin imports a substantial portion of the parts it needs. For example, the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, Bombardier, is headquartered in Canada, and has sold its regional jet program, which includes the CRJ-200 regional jets comprising Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft fleet, and the related services and support programs located in Canada to Mitsubishi. Although Mitsubishi is headquartered in Japan, we believe it intends to operate the regional jet operation it has acquired from Bombardier out of Canada. Air Wisconsin\u2019s current engine maintenance agreement is with a maintenance and repair organization that performs its services in Canada. We cannot predict the impact of potential regulatory changes, or action by U.S. regulatory agencies, including the potential impact of tariffs or changes in international trade treaties on the costs or timing associated with acquiring aircraft parts and services. Our business may be subject to additional costs and uncertainty as a result of potential regulatory changes, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nShould the passenger demand for air travel rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Wisconsin may experience difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots, which may negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, the supply of qualified pilots to the airline industry has been limited, which created difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots. In July 2013, the FAA issued stringent pilot qualification and crew member flight training standards, which increased the required training time for new airline pilots (the \u201cFAA Qualification Standards\u201d), and the FAA also mandated stricter rules to minimize pilot fatigue, increasing the number of pilots required to be employed for Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations as they existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and correspondingly increasing Air Wisconsin\u2019s labor costs. As a result of the significant decline in passenger demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no current shortage of qualified pilots in the airline industry.\nIf passenger demand for air travel increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Wisconsin may again experience challenges in hiring and maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified pilots due to a number of factors, including the increased flight hour requirements under the FAA Qualification Standards, the statutory mandatory retirement age of 65, and attrition resulting from the hiring needs of other airlines. Air Wisconsin has historically also experienced increases in time and resources required to train pilots due to several factors, including limited availability of flight simulators and instructors. If future pilot attrition rates outpace Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified pilots, Air Wisconsin may be unable to fly the number of flights required under the United capacity purchase agreement, which may result in penalties under the agreement, that would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nInformation technology security breaches, hardware or software failures or other information technology infrastructure disruptions may negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nThe performance and reliability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology, and the technology of United, are critical to Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Any internal technological error or failure or large-scale external interruption in the technological infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt Air Wisconsin\u2019s internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology or that of United could impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to conduct its business, lower the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft and result in increased costs. Air Wisconsin\u2019s technological systems and related data, and those of United, may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond its control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues.\nIn addition, as a part of Air Wisconsin\u2019s ordinary business operations, it collects and store sensitive data, including personal information of its employees and information of United. Air Wisconsin\u2019s information systems are subject to an increasing threat of evolving cybersecurity attacks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to Air Wisconsin\u2019s systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. Air Wisconsin may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, employees\u2019, passengers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information and disruption to its operations any or all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming to resolve, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, and require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties associated with litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot be certain that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on the business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity of Air Wisconsin and United.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, and by March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory for all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.\nOur business, as well as the industry in which Air Wisconsin operates, remains significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. United, Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, began experiencing a significant decline in domestic demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a first quarter net loss. As of the date of this filing, United expects demand will remain suppressed for the remainder of 2020 and likely into 2021. As a result of lowered demand, United cut approximately 80% of its scheduled capacity for April 2020, and approximately 90% for May 2020 and June 2020. Since March 2020, United has significantly reduced the number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s scheduled departures and block hours flown, and United may impose continued reductions. The severity and duration of global health and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict; thus, the magnitude and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and future results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe full extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies employed by United, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial health and operations and that of United, United\u2019s compliance with the United capacity purchase agreement, and future governmental actions, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. A long-term continuation of reduced passenger demand for air travel could have a material adverse effect, on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Moreover, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth herein.\nIn addition, a further outbreak of COVID-19, an outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat, or any other event that would affect travel demand, travel behavior or travel restrictions, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results and those of United. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks Impacting Financial Results - COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d within this Annual Report.\nThe airline industry is often negatively impacted by numerous factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe business of airlines is affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, facility disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, increased security measures, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and the outbreak of disease. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers and increase operating costs and decrease revenue, which in turn could adversely affect profitability. Because Air Wisconsin\u2019s revenue (other than the portion of its revenue based on the number of aircraft covered under the United capacity purchase agreement) depends primarily on Air Wisconsin\u2019s completion of flights, and secondarily on service factors such as timeliness of departure and arrival, customer satisfaction, cancellations or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, while Air Wisconsin is to some extent protected from certain market conditions under the United capacity purchase agreement, its operations and our financial condition are currently affected, and may in the future be affected, by many other industry factors and conditions beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in economic conditions, including disruptions in the credit markets, recession, inflation, increased interest rates or fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in political conditions, including wars, outbreak of hostilities, terrorism or other political instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for airline travel or tourism;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences, perceptions, discretionary spending or demographic trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive environment due to pricing, industry consolidation or other factors; and\n\u2022\nlabor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, or similar matters impacting employees.\nThe effect of any of the foregoing factors or conditions on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations is difficult to forecast; however, the occurrence of any or all of such factors or conditions could materially and adversely affect its operations and our financial condition.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential major airline partners.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. Air Wisconsin competes primarily with other regional airlines, some of which are owned or operated by major airlines. The airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, including the mergers between Alaska Airlines and Virgin America in 2016, American Airlines and US Airways in 2013, Southwest and AirTran Airways in 2011, United and Continental Airlines in 2010 and Delta and Northwest Airlines in 2008. Any additional consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry could further limit the number of potential partners with whom Air Wisconsin could enter into capacity purchase agreements. In addition, any further consolidation activity involving United, or reduction in the size of its network, could alter its business strategy or its perception of the value of its relationship with Air Wisconsin, which could limit opportunities for Air Wisconsin to provide additional service to United. Similarly, any further consolidation or restructuring of any major air carrier\u2019s regional jet programs could negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s future growth opportunities.\nIn the course of consolidation, major airlines may also make other strategic changes, such as relocating or consolidating hubs. For example, in May 2020, United temporarily ceased Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations at Washington-Dulles and significantly reduced Air Wisconsin\u2019s average daily scheduled departures. While we expect Air Wisconsin to resume operations at Washington-Dulles in August, we cannot be certain whether these operations will be resumed, and whether United will make future changes to Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations. If United were to make changes such as these in its strategy and operations, or otherwise decide to reduce the size of its network, Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial results could be adversely impacted.\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry and will likely continue to do so.\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry in general. If additional terrorist attacks are launched against the airline industry, there may be lasting consequences of the attacks, which may include loss of life, property damage, increased security measures, higher insurance costs, increased concerns about future terrorist attacks and additional government regulation, among other factors. Additional terrorist attacks, and warnings that such attacks may occur, could negatively impact the airline industry, and result in decreased passenger traffic, increased flight delays or cancellations, as well as increased security, fuel and other costs. If a terrorist attack were to occur, whether or not involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin or its aircraft type could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\nAn accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could result in significant potential claims of injured passengers and others, as well as negative impacts on its operations resulting from the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. In the event of an accident, Air Wisconsin\u2019s liability insurance may not be adequate to offset its exposure to potential claims, and it may be forced to bear substantial losses from the accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our operational and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations are less safe or reliable than other airlines, which could negatively impact our operations and financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, given that Air Wisconsin currently operates a single aircraft type, any accident or incident involving the CRJ-200 regional jet aircraft type, whether or not operated by Air Wisconsin, may result in Air Wisconsin temporarily or permanently suspending service on all or a large portion of its fleet. Any grounding of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could have an adverse impact on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations, its relationship with United, and our financial results.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to significant governmental regulation and potential regulatory changes.\nAll interstate air carriers, including Air Wisconsin, are subject to regulation by the DOT, the FAA and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements. We cannot predict whether Air Wisconsin will be able to comply with all present and future laws, rules, regulations and certification requirements or that the cost of continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Air Wisconsin incurs substantial costs in maintaining its current certification and otherwise complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Air Wisconsin\u2019s business may also be subject to additional costs as a result of potential regulatory changes, which could have an adverse effect on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial results.\nIn addition to state and federal regulation, airports and municipalities enact rules and regulations that affect Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and require that it incur substantial ongoing costs.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the use, management, disposal and release of, and exposure to, hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Air Wisconsin is or may be subject to new or proposed laws and regulations that may have a direct effect on its operations (or an indirect effect through its third-party specialists or airport facilities at which it operates). Any such existing, future, new or potential laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, Air Wisconsin is subject to environmental laws and regulations that require it to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that Air Wisconsin could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to it, which liability could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nBecause there is no active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock, the common stock may continue to be illiquid.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is traded under the symbol \u201cHRBR\u201d on the OTC Market, the trading volume for the common stock has historically been very limited. The Company has not listed, and does not currently intend to list, the Company\u2019s common stock for trading on any national securities exchange. Accordingly, we expect the common stock to continue to be illiquid for the foreseeable future. Investors should be aware that an active trading market for the common stock may never develop or be sustained.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile. We believe the Company\u2019s stock price will be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand for air travel, tourism, discretionary spending, consumer behavior and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results from period to period;\n\u2022\nour actual or perceived need for additional capital;\n\u2022\nthe repayment, restructuring or refinancing of Air Wisconsin\u2019s debt obligations;\n\u2022\nthe illiquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions about our financial stability generally, and relative to our competitors, and perceptions about the financial stability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions regarding Air Wisconsin\u2019s operating performance, reliability and customer service, and the operating performance, reliability and customer service of its partners and competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors and perceptions impacting the airline industry generally, including future passenger demand for air travel;\n\u2022\nother pandemics and other widespread outbreaks of communicable diseases;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures by us or Air Wisconsin\u2019s competitors, including any new or amended capacity purchase agreement with United;\n\u2022\nbankruptcies or other financial issues impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s partners or competitors;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by the Company or its principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s business and industry;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading practices of the Company\u2019s stockholders and other market participants;\n\u2022\nperceptions about securities that are traded on the OTC Market;\n\u2022\nthe lack of publicly available historical financial information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political or economic conditions.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. These changes may occur without regard to the financial condition or operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with the Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s capital stock among a small number of stockholders could allow such stockholders to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, or deter a change in control transaction, any of which could negatively affect the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs of May 31, 2020, the Company had 54,863,305 shares of common stock outstanding. As of the same date, Amun held 20,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, representing approximately 28.0% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company, and Southshore held 4,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, representing approximately 23.1% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company (in each case assuming the full conversion of the Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock into common stock). The shares of Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock are generally authorized to vote with the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, Amun and Southshore collectively control a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock and, therefore, are able to exercise significant influence over the establishment and implementation of the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, as well as to control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval. These stockholders may manage the Company\u2019s business in ways in which certain investors disagree and may be adverse to their interests. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control transaction, depriving the Company\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock, or otherwise negatively affecting the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nMr. Bartlett, one of the Company\u2019s directors, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock held by Amun due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Amun, and his indirect ownership of 19.6% of the outstanding equity of Amun. In addition, Mr. Bartlett may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock held by Southshore due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Southshore, and his direct or indirect ownership of 19.6% of the outstanding equity of Southshore. Accordingly, Mr. Bartlett may be able to exercise influence over decisions involving the voting or disposition of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. However, Mr. Bartlett does not control voting or investment decisions made by either Amun or Southshore.\nThe Company may suspend its obligation to comply with SEC filing requirements in future periods, and thereby cease filing reports and other information with the SEC, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn February 2012, the Company\u2019s predecessor, Harbor Biosciences, Inc., filed a Form 15 with the SEC to deregister its common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The filing of the Form 15 had the effect of suspending the Company\u2019s obligation, pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to file reports and other information with the SEC. As a result, prior to this Annual Report, the last periodic report filed by the Company was the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the SEC on January 20, 2012. As of January 1, 2020, the Company no longer met the eligibility criteria under Rule 12h-3 of the Exchange Act to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company determined that it is currently required to file reports and other information with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nThe Company has incurred significant direct and indirect costs, and diversion of management time and resources, as a result of the requirement to comply with certain reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, including those incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of this Annual Report, the audit of the financial statements contained in this Annual Report in accordance with SEC rules and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) standards, and compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company expects to incur significant additional costs relating to its public reporting obligations, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company would again become eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations if it (i) determines it has fewer than 300 stockholders of record (as determined in accordance with applicable SEC rules) as of certain points in time, (ii) does not file registration statements pursuant to the Securities Act, and (iii) meets certain other requirements under applicable SEC rules. In the event the Company becomes eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations in future periods, it may elect to take the actions necessary to suspend those obligations, which would result in the Company no longer being required to file SEC reports. If the Company ceases filing reports and other information with the SEC, it would significantly reduce the amount of publicly available information about the Company and its subsidiaries, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn addition, notwithstanding that the Company is currently required to file certain reports and information with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company does not have a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company is not required to comply with, and does not intend to follow, certain disclosure requirements typically applicable to public reporting companies, including the requirement to file proxy statements, information statements, tender offer disclosures, and beneficial ownership filings. Accordingly, there may be significantly less information available about the Company, including its governance policies and ownership structure, than is available for other public reporting companies, which may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s common stock and further reduce the trading volume and trading price.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s charter documents and the United capacity purchase agreement might deter acquisition bids, which could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as the United capacity purchase agreement, contain provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibit the transfer of any shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that would result in (i) any person or entity becoming a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(g)) of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding capital stock, or (ii) an increase in the percentage ownership of any person or entity who is already a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding capital stock;\n\u2022\nauthorize the Company\u2019s board of directors, without stockholder approval, to authorize and issue preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and could also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Company\u2019s board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual or special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022\nauthorize a majority of the Company\u2019s board of directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Company\u2019s board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company\u2019s board of directors;\n\u2022\ngive the Company\u2019s board of directors exclusive authority to set the number of directors and increase or decrease the number of directors by one or more resolutions, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company\u2019s board of directors;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the United capacity purchase agreement, provide that a change of control of Air Wisconsin results in a termination event under the agreement, pursuant to which United may terminate its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nThe requirement that Air Wisconsin remain a citizen of the United States limits the potential purchasers of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nUnder DOT regulations and federal law, Air Wisconsin must be owned and controlled by citizens of the United States as that term is defined in the Federal Aviation Act and interpreted by DOT. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations limit who can purchase Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities in the following ways:\n\u2022\nat least 75% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s voting equity securities must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States;\n\u2022\nat least 51% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country; and\n\u2022\ncitizens of foreign countries that have not entered into an \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. may hold no more than 25% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities.\nThe restrictions on foreign ownership of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder of the Company and may adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell the Company\u2019s common stock. We cannot predict the effect that these restrictions may have on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws limit certain transfers of the Company\u2019s stock in order to preserve the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, which could have an effect on the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prohibit certain transfers of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that could result in adverse tax consequences by impairing the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. These transfer restrictions are subject to a number of rules and exceptions, and generally may only be repealed or amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. These transfer restrictions apply to the beneficial owners of the shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. The Company\u2019s board of directors also has the ability to grant certain waivers and to modify certain terms with respect to transfers of the Company\u2019s stock that would otherwise be prohibited. The transfer restrictions contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may limit demand for the Company\u2019s common stock, which may adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur, or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial, any of which could also adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company currently does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company has not historically paid dividends on shares of its common stock and does not expect to pay dividends on such shares in the foreseeable future. The United capacity purchase agreement and Air Wisconsin\u2019s credit agreements with its lender contain restrictions that limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay, or prohibit it from paying, dividends to the Company. In addition, the PSP Agreement that Air Wisconsin entered into in April 2020 with the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to the recently enacted CARES Act prevents it from paying dividends prior to October 1, 2021. Thus, the source of any future dividends may be limited to cash available from the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future credit agreements or capacity purchase agreements, business prospects and such other factors as the Company\u2019s board of directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors should consider that their only opportunity to achieve a positive return on their investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the Company\u2019s common stock. However, as a result of numerous risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may not appreciate and may decline significantly.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company may avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations, and it will continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as either (i) the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of its most recently completed second quarter is less than $250 million or (ii) if the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million, and the annual revenue of the Company is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public reporting companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and disclosure regarding executive compensation. Investors may find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive because it relies on these exemptions, which could lead to a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and of the Company\u2019s common stock price.\nComplying with the requirements of public reporting companies under the Exchange Act, including the requirement for management to assess our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, will increase our operating costs and divert management\u2019s attention from executing our business strategy.\nThe Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that it file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and, in future periods, we will be required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these various reporting and compliance obligations has substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some of our business activities more difficult or costly, and increased demand on our management team.\nSignificant resources and management oversight may be required to maintain and, as required, enhance our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As discussed below, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We may incur significant costs in an effort to remediate these material weaknesses and enhance our controls and procedures. In addition, these efforts may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our results of operations.\nAs a result of our compliance with Exchange Act reporting obligations, a significant amount of information regarding our business and operations, including our financial condition and operating results, will become publicly available, which may result in threatened or actual litigation or other disputes with our key constituents. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could suffer, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the Company\u2019s status as a public reporting company has significantly increased the cost of its director and officer liability insurance, and the Company may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs in the future to obtain similar coverage. These factors, or other risks associated with being a public reporting company, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of the Company\u2019s board of directors and executive officers, and it may increase the cost of their services.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements to our financial statements in future periods.\nAs further discussed in the section entitled \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d within this Annual Report, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2019 primarily relate to: (i) the application of accounting treatment for certain complex and non-routine transactions, (ii) the adoption of new accounting standards related to Topic 606 and Topic 842, (iii) the establishment and design of processes and controls to document and monitor certain controls over financial reporting, (iv) the design of controls for user access rights related to certain information technology systems, and (v) the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. While we intend to enhance our controls and procedures, and to remediate the material weaknesses that remain unremediated, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in remediating these material weaknesses, or preventing future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We expect to incur significant costs and diversion of management resources in an effort to remediate any material weaknesses and enhance our controls and procedures. During our ongoing evaluation of our controls and procedures, we may identify additional control deficiencies, which could give rise to additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. The material weaknesses described above, or any newly identified material weaknesses, could result in material misstatements of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Any such misstatements of our financial statements could lead to restatements of our financial statements, which could result in an adverse impact to our financial results and a decline in the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may be at increased risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the price of a company\u2019s securities. If the Company faces such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish reports about our business, an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock may not develop.\nThe extent of any trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will depend, in part, on any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We are not currently aware of any analysts who cover the Company nor do we expect any analysts to commence coverage in the foreseeable future. Investors should not purchase the Company\u2019s common stock with the expectation that we will have analyst coverage, or that an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will be developed or sustained.", "PERMNO": 85376, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HRBR"}
