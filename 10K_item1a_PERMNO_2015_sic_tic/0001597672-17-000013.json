{"cik": "1597672", "company": "RAYONIER ADVANCED MATERIALS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nThe cellulose specialties industry in which we operate is highly competitive, which is expected to result in reduced pricing and volumes.\nWe face competition from domestic and foreign producers of cellulose specialties, which is our primary source of profitability. Demand weakness combined with increased cellulose specialties production capacity from our competitors drove cellulose specialties sales prices down approximately 13 percent over the last two years and we expect prices to decline an additional three to four percent in 2017. Further, in 2016 sales volumes of cellulose specialties decreased approximately two percent from 2015, and are expected to be relatively flat in 2017 versus 2016.\nContinued demand weakness and over-supply may have a material adverse impact on our future cellulose specialties sales prices and volumes resulting in a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of large cellulose specialties customers for a majority of our sales. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks related to customer concentration because of the relative importance of our largest cellulose specialties customers, many of whom we have been doing business with for decades, and the ability of those customers to influence pricing and other contract terms. We depend on major acetate tow manufacturers for a substantial portion of our sales. Our ten largest cellulose specialties customers, which accounted for approximately 75 percent of sales in 2016, are all either well known, global diversified specialty chemical companies or state-owned enterprises. Although we strive to broaden and diversify our customer base, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large-volume customers, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any of these customers, or significant, unfavorable changes to pricing or terms contained in contracts with them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are also subject to credit risk associated with this customer concentration. If one or more of our largest cellulose specialties customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for its products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 3 - Segment and Geographical Information for information on our major customers.\nAnti-tobacco legislation, campaigns to discourage smoking, increases in tobacco taxes, increased costs of tobacco products and increased use of traditional cigarette substitutes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our cellulose specialties fibers are used to manufacture acetate tow, which is used to make the filter component of a cigarette. Our sales for this end-use have historically accounted for an important portion of our total sales revenue. Significant increases in cigarette costs and potential actions taken by the United States and other countries to discourage smoking, such as tax increases on tobacco products, policy changes and future legislation, may have a material adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products. For example, actions by the Chinese government to curb corruption and limit smoking in public buildings have had some impact on cigarette consumption. Additionally, increased use of e-cigarettes, electronically heated tobacco products and smokeless tobacco products, by way of example, may affect demand for traditional cigarettes. Reduced sales of tobacco products that use acetate-based filters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We estimate that over the past three years approximately 55 percent of our sales were related to the production of acetate tow subsequently used to produce cigarette filters.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the cyclicality of the business of certain of our customers, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nSome of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the construction, automotive and textile industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control. The industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity or reductions in demand, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. The consequences of this could include the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Although the occurrence of these events has not had a material impact on our historical financial condition, the occurrence of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation in the future.\nFailure to develop new products, or discover new applications for our existing products and cellulose chemistry expertise, could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have an active research and development program to develop new products and new applications for our existing products and chemical cellulose expertise. However, there can be no assurance this program will be successful, either from a product development or commercialization perspective, or that any particular invention, product or development, or the program as a whole, will lead to significant revenue or profit generation. Failure to generate meaningful revenue and profit from our research and product development efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nCurrency fluctuations may have a negative impact on our business.\nOur cellulose specialties sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars and, as a result, currency fluctuations can also negatively impact our competitiveness. A weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar creates an advantage for our competitors whose costs are denominated in local currencies. Favorable exchange rates enable such competitors to convert sales denominated in the U.S. dollar to local currencies and procure locally produced raw materials at lower costs.\nWeak local currencies may have a material adverse impact on our future cellulose specialties sales prices and volumes resulting in a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could negatively affect customer demand.\nThe global reach of our business subjects us to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances, such as those that may result from the volatile state of the global economic and financial markets, in addition to those experienced in the United States. Countervailing duty and anti-dumping tariffs, or similar types of tariffs, may be imposed on us, which could result in reduced revenues and margins on some of our businesses. For example, after a lengthy investigation, in April of 2014, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) issued a final determination assessing a 17.2 percent duty on imports into China of our lower purity commodity viscose, which is primarily utilized to produce viscose staple fiber for use in the manufacture of fabrics. We expect MOFCOM\u2019s final determination to remain in place for five years. MOFCOM\u2019s duty could have an adverse effect on our sales of commodity viscose.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nAlthough our production facilities are located in the United States, a significant portion of our sales are to customer locations outside of the United States, including China, Japan, the European Union and other international markets. The export of our products into international markets results in risks that are inherent in conducting business under international laws, regulations and customs. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 60 percent of our revenue in 2016. We expect international sales will continue to contribute significantly to our financial condition and future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the United States include:\n\u2022\nchanges in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which we sell our products;\n\u2022\nresponsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntrade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nproduct damage or losses incurred during shipping;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022\neconomic instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures; and\n\u2022\nminimal or limited protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nThese risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. An example is the 2016 Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amends the Toxic Substances Control Act and, among other things, increases the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) oversight of chemical manufacturing and use. Over the past few years, the EPA has pursued a number of initiatives that, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like ours, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and storm water control. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation for further information. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur plants are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that may limit operations and production. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that contain conditions governing how we operate our facilities including how much and, in some cases, what types of products we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production, limit our ability to increase production and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.\nEnvironmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states where we operate plants. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. For example, in March 2014, litigation was commenced in federal court by the Altamaha Riverkeeper alleging violations of federal and state environmental laws relating to permitted wastewater discharges from our Jesup plant (although it was dismissed by the court on summary judgment in 2015), and in January of 2016 the same group brought an action in the Georgia Office of Administrative Hearings against the Georgia Environmental Protection Division of the Natural Resources (\u201cEPD\u201d) in opposition to the issuance by EPD of a renewed wastewater treatment permit for our Jesup plant. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for a description of the pending legal proceedings with the Altamaha Riverkeeper.\nWe currently own or may acquire properties that require environmental remediation or otherwise are subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own or formerly operated manufacturing facilities that we do not currently own, and may acquire additional facilities in the future, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other liabilities. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate liabilities recorded, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of contaminated properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance actual expenditures will not exceed current liabilities and forecasts, or that other presently unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Regulation and Note 14 - Liabilities for Disposed Operations. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital, operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to our obligation to assess and remediate contaminated properties. We could also incur substantial costs, such as those relating to enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution\ncontrol equipment or other remedial actions), remediation and closure costs, as well as third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities arising out of, environmental laws and regulations.\nThe impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.\nThere are numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the United States, most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more \u201cclean energy.\u201d\nBeginning in 2009, EPA began regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Current rules affecting our operations include requirements to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions from our plant operations and to consider greenhouse gases when permitting new or modified facilities. However, a 2014 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, limited the ability of the government to regulate greenhouse gases during new and modified source permitting, which reduced somewhat the scope and breadth of EPA\u2019s 2009 actions.\nIn 2015, EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from electric power plants. The regulation is not directed at industry generally, but has very broad requirements that could affect fuel and energy prices for industrial energy consumers. Further, the rule directs states to customize their regulations, which could lead to different results in different states and create additional uncertainty. The rule has been legally challenged by a number of states, industry groups and environmental organizations. On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of its implementation while the rule is reviewed by lower courts. It is not certain what impact this rule, if not invalidated by the courts, will have on our operations.\nIn December of 2015, the United States signed the Paris Agreement on climate change (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d), which was entered into under the auspices of the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (the \u201cUN Framework\u201d), a treaty signed by the U.S. and ratified by the U.S. Senate. The Paris Agreement includes national targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and other provisions designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and provide financial incentives to developing nations to discourage greenhouse gas emissions. As of December 31, 2016, 197 countries have signed the Paris Agreement and 125 have ratified it. It is currently unclear how the current U.S. president and his administration will address the Paris Agreement.\nOverall, it is reasonably likely legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way affect us, but it is unclear at this time when this may occur, and whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive, negative, neutral or material. For example, while our plants produce greenhouse gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a meaningful amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to as \u201cbiomass\u201d), which may be viewed more favorably than fossil fuels in future legislative and regulatory proposals, but that is uncertain at this time. However, to date, many environmental groups have generally opposed the use of biomass for energy production due to their concerns about deforestation. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on us, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint over the long term, remains uncertain at this time.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environments may materially adversely affect our future access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or equity or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be materially adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our major customers or suppliers, or if other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing or other costs of capital or affect our ability to gain access to the capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need to make significant additional cash contributions to our retirement benefit plans if investment returns on pension assets are lower than expected or interest rates decline, and/or due to changes to regulatory, accounting and actuarial requirements.\nWe have a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. In addition, it is possible new or additional accounting rules and changes to actuarial requirements (for example, if life expectancy assumptions for participants are increased) may also result in the need for additional contributions to the plans. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally. We rely on these providers for transportation of the products we manufacture as well as delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities. A significant portion of the products we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported in the United States by railroad or trucks, and internationally by ship.\nIf any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture in a timely manner, or damaged them during transport, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely manufacture our products in response to customer demand. Finally, if any of the ports we commonly use for international shipping, or the port system generally, were to suffer work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, we could be adversely impacted.\nAny significant failure of third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials or finished products could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and adversely affect our business. In addition, increases in transportation rates or fuel costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in raw material and manufacturing input prices could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause pricing for the majority of our cellulose specialties fibers customers is set annually or otherwise by contract, we typically have very limited ability to pass along fluctuations in costs to customers after pricing has been established. Raw material costs and energy, such as wood, chemicals, oil and natural gas are a significant operating expense. The cost of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key manufacturing input, has historically had significant price volatility. Similarly, the price of oil and natural gas (including its pipeline transportation cost) is subject to fluctuations based on market and other factors. These and other similar circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather and other natural conditions may increase the prices of and reduce access to raw materials.\nWe use large quantities of wood as a raw material in our fiber manufacturing process. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access to timberlands for harvesting (for example, due to prolonged wet conditions) may limit the availability and increase the price of wood (and, in particular, hardwood species), as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.\nRaw materials are available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases; however, during times of limited supply caused by weather and other natural conditions, we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us. An insufficient supply of wood could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or a part of any particular facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\na chemical spill or release;\n\u2022\nexplosion of a boiler or other pressure vessel;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;\n\u2022\nterrorism or threats of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nother operational problems.\nFurthermore, depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption due to any such event, the results could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 65 percent of our work force is unionized. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. Our collective bargaining agreements at our Jesup, Georgia plant expire on June 30, 2017 and negotiations relating to new agreements have commenced. If our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.\nWe rely primarily on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, covenants not to compete (where warranted), established internal policies and practices and various physical security and cyber security measures, among other actions, to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.\nThe risk of loss of the Company\u2019s intellectual property, including trade secrets or other sensitive business information, disruption of its manufacturing operations, in each case due to cyber attacks or cyber security breaches, could adversely impact the Company.\nCyber attacks or cyber security breaches could compromise the Company\u2019s intellectual property, including confidential business information, cause a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations or harm the Company\u2019s reputation. For example, our Jesup facility purchases some of its electricity from the grid and, therefore, any cyber attack on the electricity transmission system could adversely impact Jesup\u2019s operations. While the Company has implemented an appropriate cyber security program, there can be no assurance a cyber attack would not be successful, or that such a cyber security breach will not occur. Such an event could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of our products by us, including products manufactured for use by the food, cigarette, automotive and pharmaceutical industries, involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims, and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect confidence in our products, and divert management\u2019s attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Although we have standard contracting policies and controls, we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third-party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls.\nWe have debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total combined indebtedness was $783 million.\nThis significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments on this debt;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nreducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nTo the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nOur operations require substantial capital.\nWe require substantial capital for ongoing maintenance, repair and replacement of existing facilities and equipment. Although we maintain our production equipment with regular scheduled maintenance, key pieces of equipment may need to be repaired or replaced periodically. The costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new or existing environmental regulations at times require additional capital expenditures for compliance.\nWe believe our capital resources are currently adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. However, if for any reason we are unable to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on reasonable economic terms, we could experience an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities, make strategic investments in our facilities or require funding to invest in joint ventures or make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital and/or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, it may be subject to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants in addition to those that are expected to be in place pursuant to our existing indebtedness.\nThe inability to make or effectively integrate future acquisitions may affect our results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses and product lines, and invest in joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not achieve the benefits anticipated from our announced transformation plan.\nWe are two years into a four year plan to significantly reduce costs and increase cash flows. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview for more information. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits within the remaining two years could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nYour percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have options to purchase shares of our common stock and we anticipate our compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to our employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. In particular, note that, on August 10, 2016, the Company issued 1,725,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), as more fully described in that certain Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-209747) and Prospectus filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, as amended by that certain Prospectus Supplement dated August 4, 2016 (the \u201cProspectus Supplement\u201d). As a result of this offering, unless earlier converted, the Preferred Stock will automatically convert to common stock of the Company on a mandatory conversion date expected to be August 15, 2019, at a conversion rate described in the Prospectus Supplement. See Note 10 - Stockholders Equity for more information on the Preferred Stock.\nOur common stock ranks junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, subject to certain exceptions, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to Preferred Stock holders a liquidation preference equal to $100.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\nCertain provisions of the Preferred Stock could prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the price of our common stock.\nCertain terms of our Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire the Company. For example, as more fully described in the Prospectus Supplement, if a fundamental change (including, certain consolidation or merger involving us) were to occur on or prior to August 15, 2019, holders of our Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at a fundamental change conversion rate and be entitled to receive a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Preferred Stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any. These features of the Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring the Company.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, could prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contain, provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;\n\u2022\na provision that stockholders may only remove directors with cause;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80 percent of our voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws relating to the number, term and election of our directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control you may favor. Section 203 provides, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the action may be brought in another court sitting in the State of Delaware. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nThe Company\u2019s historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe historical information about the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for periods prior to the Separation, refers to the Company\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with Rayonier. The Company\u2019s historical pre-Separation financial information is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Rayonier. Accordingly, the pre-Separation financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows the Company would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those the Company will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, the Company\u2019s business was operated by Rayonier as a segment of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Rayonier or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for the Company, such as accounting, information technology and finance. The Company\u2019s pre-Separation historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Rayonier for such functions and are likely\nto be less than the expenses the Company would have incurred had it operated as a separate publicly traded company. The Company will need to make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure and personnel to which the Company no longer has access as a result of its separation from Rayonier. These initiatives to develop the Company\u2019s independent ability to operate without access to Rayonier\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement. The Company may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline;\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, the Company was able to use Rayonier\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. As a separate, independent company, the Company may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the Separation, which could decrease the Company\u2019s overall profitability; and\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for the Company\u2019s business may be higher than Rayonier\u2019s cost of capital prior to the Separation.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Rayonier pursuant to the separation agreement could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe separation agreement with Rayonier provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between the Company and Rayonier with respect to and resulting from the Separation. Among other things, the separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make the Company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Company's separation from Rayonier, as well as those obligations of Rayonier assumed by the Company pursuant to the separation agreement. If the Company is required to indemnify Rayonier under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement, the Company may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nThe Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and the Separation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation and distribution is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) a distinct investment identity allowing investors to evaluate the merits, performance and future prospects of the Company separately from Rayonier; (ii) more efficient allocation of capital for the Company; and (iii) direct access by the Company to the capital markets.\nThe Company may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) the Company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Rayonier; (b) the Company\u2019s business is less diversified than Rayonier\u2019s business prior to the Separation; and (c) the other actions required to separate Rayonier\u2019s and the Company\u2019s respective businesses could have diverted management's attention from planning to grow and operate the Company\u2019s business or created disruptions of the Company\u2019s operations that could, in each case, impact the Company\u2019s performance in the future. If the Company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial conditions and results of operations of the Company could be adversely affected.\nThere could be significant liability if the distribution of common stock that occurred as a result of the Separation is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nOur former parent, Rayonier, received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that, among other things, the Separation and the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is a condition to the distribution that this private letter ruling shall not be revoked or modified in any material respect. In addition, Rayonier received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that, with respect to certain requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Rayonier and the Company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Rayonier and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nNotwithstanding a private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit the Separation is taxable if it determines any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Rayonier or the Company after the separation. If the Separation\nis determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Rayonier and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and the Company could incur significant liabilities. In connection with the Separation, Rayonier and the Company entered into a tax matters agreement, which describes the sharing of any such liabilities between Rayonier and the Company.", "PERMNO": 14682, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "RYAM"}
