{"cik": "842518", "company": "EVANS BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following factors identified by the Company's management represent significant potential risks that the Company faces in its operations.\nCredit Risks\nCommercial Real Estate and Commercial Business Loans Expose the Company to Increased Credit Risks\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company's portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $813 million, or 48% of total loans outstanding, and the Company's portfolio of commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") loans totaled $430 million, or 25% of total loans outstanding. The Company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans as they generally earn\na higher rate of interest than other loan products offered by the Bank. However, commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and C&I loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers. Commercial mortgages are collateralized by real property while C&I loans are typically secured by business assets such as equipment and accounts receivable. Commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of the Company's commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or C&I loan outstanding with the Company. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan. Commercial real estate loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2020 were $17.5 million, compared with $7.2 million at December 31, 2019. C&I loans in non-accrual status were $6.5 million and $4.8 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Increases in the delinquency levels of commercial real estate and C&I loans could result in an increase in non-performing loans and the provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nContinuing Concentration of Loans in the Company's Primary Market Area May Increase the Company's Risk\n\ufeff\nUnlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers located primarily in the Western and Finger Lakes Region of New York State. Therefore, the Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in those areas. The Company's business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small and medium-sized businesses in this geographic region. Moreover, the Company's assets are heavily concentrated in mortgages on properties located in the Western and Finger Lakes Region of New York State. Accordingly, the Company's business and operations are vulnerable to downturns in the economy of those areas. The concentration of the Company's loans in this geographic region subjects the Company to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, which would more greatly affect the Company than if the Company's lending were more geographically diversified. In addition, the Company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the Company's mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations.\nIn the Event the Company's Allowance for Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, the Company's Earnings Could Decrease\n\ufeff\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in order to capture the probable incurred losses inherent in its loan portfolio. There is a risk that the Company may experience significant loan losses which could exceed the recorded amount of the allowance for loan losses. In determining the amount of the Company's recorded allowance, the Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers, the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans, the effects on the Company's loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, and the Company's loan quality reviews. The emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and C&I loans is a significant factor in evaluating the allowance for loan losses. As the Company continues to increase the amount of these loans in the portfolio, additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary and would adversely affect the results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company's loan portfolio and credit underwriting procedures, as well as its allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a gross loan portfolio of $1.7 billion and the allowance for loan losses was $20.4 million, which represented 1.21% of the total amount of gross loans. If the Company's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, the Company may have to increase its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition. Additionally, there can be no assurances that the Company's allowance for loan losses will be adequate to protect the Company against loan losses that it may incur.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is Subject to Litigation, Regulatory, Reputation and Other Risks Related to Its Participation in the Paycheck Protection Program\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic hardships, the CARES Act provided for the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP) as a loan program administered through the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other lenders, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria. During 2020, we participated in the PPP, adding almost 1,000 new commercial customers and $203 million in PPP loans.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. There continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications and the payment of fees to agents that assisted borrowers in obtaining PPP loans. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although we believe that we have administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, we may be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention related to our participation in the PPP. Any such litigation may result in significant financial liability to us or adversely affect our reputation.\nFederal and state regulators can also impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, including with respect to our PPP lending, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nFurther, there is a risk that PPP borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness feature of the program due to the conduct of the borrower after the loan is originated. We also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans given that the SBA may determine that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. These factors may result in us having to hold a significant amount of these low-yield loans on our books for a significant period of time. Moreover, in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental Factors May Create Liability\n\ufeff\nIn the course of its business, the Bank has acquired, and may acquire in the future, property securing loans that are in default. There is a risk that the Bank could be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition by the Bank in a foreclosure action, and that the Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination. The Bank may in the future be required to perform an investigation or clean-up activities in connection with environmental claims. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nInterest Rate Risks\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company's Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\ufeff\nThe Company's results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Company's results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. Because the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally re-price or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates could result in a decrease in its net interest income.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of the Company's interest-earning assets, and in particular, the Company's securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2020, the Company's securities available for sale totaled $162 million. Net unrealized gains on securities available for sale amounted to $2.4 million, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale could have an adverse effect on stockholders' equity or earnings.\nThe Company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, the Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\n\ufeff\nThe FRB reduced the targeted federal funds rate a total of 150 basis points in March 2020. These actions have put pressure on the Company's net interest margin due to the re-pricing of the variable rate loan portfolio. There is risk that further margin compression could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company Is Required to Transition From the Use of LIBOR\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. LIBOR will be discontinued in June 2023. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for the LIBOR (e.g. the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate financial instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in the Company's portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. If the Company is required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, it may incur expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Additionally, since alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition may change the Company's market risk profile, requiring changes to risk and pricing models.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Company Operates in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected By Changes in Laws and Regulations\n\ufeff\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, FRB, and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors. Regulatory requirements affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the imposition of deposit insurance premiums and other assessments, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, the Company and its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\") has the authority to issue consumer finance regulations and is authorized, individually or jointly with bank regulatory agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates new and existing consumer financial laws or regulations. Because we have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the FRB and NYSDFS, not the CFPB, are responsible for examining and supervising our compliance with these consumer protection laws and regulations. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and U.S. Department of Justice, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations, and have done so on a number of occasions.\n\ufeff\nNoncompliance with applicable regulations may lead to adverse consequences for the Company. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company also faces a risk of noncompliance and subsequent enforcement action in connection with federal Bank Secrecy Act (the \"BSA\") and other anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing statutes and regulations. The federal banking agencies and the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. If the Company violates these laws and regulations, or its policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, it would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including its acquisition plans. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\ufeff\nFuture FDIC Insurance Premium Increases May Adversely Affect the Company's Earnings\n\ufeff\nThe Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or other similar occurrences, the FDIC may again increase the premiums assessed upon insured institutions. Such increases and any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company is a Financial Holding Company and Depends on Its Subsidiaries for Dividends, Distributions and Other Payments\n\ufeff\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The Company's principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to the Company's stockholders and principal and interest on its outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its stockholders. Regulations of the OCC affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions and to make loans to the Company. If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments and sufficient capital is not otherwise available, the Company may not be able to make dividend payments to its common stockholders or principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nIf Regulators Impose Limitations on the Company's Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities, Earnings Could Be Adversely Affected\n\ufeff\nIn 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint guidance entitled \"Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\" (the \"CRE Guidance\"). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank's commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the\npreceding 36 months. The Bank's non-owner occupied commercial real estate level equaled 316% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020. Including owner-occupied commercial real estate, the ratio of commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital ratio would be 414% at December 31, 2020. If the Company's regulators were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans it can hold in its portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, the Company's earnings would be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\ufeff\nOperational Risks\nThe Company has Identified a Material Weakness in Our Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting and May Identify Additional Material Weaknesses in the Future\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, management identified a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness relates to the Company\u2019s internal controls over deposit data within the deposit accounting system. The Company did not have an independent review of new account information. Because of this material weakness, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the Treadway Commission\u2019s Committee on Sponsoring Organizations (\u201cCOSO\u201d) Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). The material weakness did not result in any changes to the Company\u2019s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough management, with the oversight of the audit committee, is taking steps to remediate the material weakness, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until new internal controls are operational for a period of time and are tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. The Company cannot predict the success of such measures or the outcome of management\u2019s assessment of these measures at this time. The Company cannot give any assurance that these measures will remediate the deficiencies in internal control or that additional material weaknesses, or that significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nA failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that may lead to a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, net income, financial condition, reputation, compliance with laws and regulations, or may result in untimely or inaccurate financial reporting.\nThe Potential for Business Interruption Exists Throughout the Company's Organization\n\ufeff\nIntegral to the Company's performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in the Company's day-to-day and ongoing operations. Failure by any or all of these resources subjects the Company to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope. This includes, but is not limited to, operational or technical failures, pandemics, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly. Such events could affect the stability of the Company's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, cause the Company to incur additional expenses, or disrupt our third party vendors' operations, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\u200e\n\ufeff\nThe COVID-19 Outbreak Has Adversely Affected, and is Likely to Continue to Adversely Affect, the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations\n\ufeff\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In March 2020, the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments, including New York, have ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and recently passed legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. The Company has many employees working remotely and may take further actions required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the extent to which the outbreak can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Company may be subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\uf0b7demand for the Company\u2019s products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\uf0b7if the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue, for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\uf0b7collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\uf0b7the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect net income;\n\uf0b7the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments;\n\uf0b7as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on the Company\u2019s assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in its cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing its net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\uf0b7a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate or a cancellation of the Company\u2019s semi-annual cash dividend;\n\uf0b7cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and\n\uf0b7the Company relies on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nMoreover, the Company\u2019s future success and profitability substantially depends on its executive officers and directors, many of whom have held positions with the Company for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy. The Company may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\n\u200e\nLack of System Integrity or Credit Quality Related to Funds Settlement Could Result in a Financial Loss\n\ufeff\nThe Bank settles funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receives funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by the Bank include debit card, credit card and electronic bill payment transactions, supporting consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties and the facilitation of the payment. If the continuity of operations or integrity of processing were compromised this could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore the Company, due to a failure in payment facilitation. In addition, the Bank may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore to the Company.\n\ufeff\nFinancial Services Companies Depend on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information about Customers and Counterparties\n\ufeff\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause the Company to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nBecause the Nature of the Financial Services Business Involves a High Volume of Transactions, the Company Faces Significant Operational Risks\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Company's operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operation.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's Information Systems May Experience an Interruption or Breach in Security\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. As a financial institution, we process a significant number of customer transactions and possess a significant amount of sensitive customer information. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile phones, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of our communications and information systems, or the systems of third parties on which we rely to process transactions, could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. There can be no assurance that failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company's information systems will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Unauthorized third parties regularly seek to gain access to nonpublic, private and other information through computer systems. If customers' personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information in the Company's possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company's systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company's information systems could, among other consequences,\ndamage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, result in increased insurance premiums, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results In addition, increased cost of compliance with cybersecurity regulations, at the federal and state level, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company May Be Adversely Affected by the Soundness of Other Financial Institutions\n\ufeff\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and impact our business. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be relied upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe most important counterparty for the Company, in terms of liquidity, is the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLBNY\"). The Company uses FHLBNY as its primary source of borrowed overnight funds and also has several long-term advances with FHLBNY. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $44 million in borrowed funds with FHLBNY. The Company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of commercial and residential real estate loans at FHLBNY. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Bank is required to hold stock in FHLBNY. The Bank held FHLBNY stock with a fair value of $3.5 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\ufeff\nThere are 11 branches of the FHLB, including New York. If a branch were at risk of breaching risk-based capital requirements, it could suspend dividends, cut dividend payments, and/or not buy back excess FHLB stock that members hold. FHLBNY has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. Nonetheless, the 11 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system's debt; other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment.\nSystemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings, reduced value of FHLB stock, and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks.\n\ufeff\nA Decline in the Value of the Company's Deferred Tax Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company's Operating Results and Regulatory Capital Ratios\n\ufeff\nThe Company's tax strategies depend on the ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The Company's tax strategies will be less effective in the event the Company fails to generate anticipated amounts of taxable income. The value of the Company's deferred tax assets is subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized\nfor financial statement purposes. In making this determination, management considers all positive and negative evidence available, including the Company's historical levels of taxable income, the opportunity for net operating loss carrybacks, and projections for future taxable income over the statutory tax loss carryover period. If the Company were to conclude that a significant portion of deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the value of the Company's deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by a change in statutory tax rates.\nStrategic Risks\nExpansion of the Company's Branch Network May Adversely Affect its Financial Results\n\ufeff\nThe Company cannot assure that the opening of new branches will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch, such as suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses. Difficulties the Company experiences in opening new branches may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nMergers and Acquisitions Involve Numerous Risks and Uncertainties\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including the expenses involved; integration of branches and operations acquired; the outflow of customers from the acquired branches; the successful retention of personnel from acquired companies or branches; competing effectively in geographic areas not previously served; managing growth resulting from the transaction; and dilution in the acquirer's book and tangible book value per share.\nOn May 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of FSB Bancorp, Inc. and Fairport Savings Bank. The integration of these entities and their business with the Company and the Bank may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\n\ufeff\nAnti-Takeover Laws and Certain Agreements and Charter Provisions May Adversely Affect Share Value\n\ufeff\nCertain provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company without approval of the Company's board of directors. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the FRB before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of the Company's common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquiror \"controls\" the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the Bank. There also are provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror and thus could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\n\ufeff\nGeneric Risk Factors\nThe Company's Business May Be Adversely Affected by Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally\nThe Company's financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in Western New York and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, declines in housing and real estate\nvaluations, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\n\ufeff\nStrong Competition Within the Company's Market Area May Limit the Company's Growth and Profitability\n\ufeff\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. The Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and financial technology companies operating locally within the Company's market area and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company does, and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. The Company's profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area.\n\ufeff\nLoss of Key Employees May Disrupt Relationships with Certain Customers\n\ufeff\nThe Company's business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of the key employees of the Bank and TEA have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While management believes that the Company's relationships with its key business producers are good, the Company cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization. Loss of such key personnel, particularly if they enter into an employment relationship with one of the Company's competitors, could result in the loss of some of the Company's customers. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDamage to the Company's Reputation Could Adversely Impact our Business\n\ufeff\nThe Company's business reputation is important to its success. The ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors may depend upon external perceptions of the Company. Damage to the Company's reputation could cause significant harm to its business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees, advisors and counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage the Company's reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and advisors. Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company's reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against the Company. Preserving and enhancing the Company's reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as its ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in businesses and the marketplaces in which the Company operates, the regulatory environment and client expectations. If any of these developments has a material effect on the Company's reputation, its business could suffer.\nFurthermore, shareholders and other stakeholders have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues. Governments, investors, customers and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures, and views about ESG are diverse and rapidly changing. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. The Company could also face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional media or social media if shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters. If the Company, or our relationships with certain customers, vendors or suppliers became the subject of negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely impacted.\n\u200e", "PERMNO": 89038, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EVBN"}
