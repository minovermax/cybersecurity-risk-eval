{"cik": "1420811", "company": "On Deck Capital Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur current and prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d before making investment decisions regarding our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but include the most significant factors currently known by us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing our business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to:\n\u2022\nincrease the number and total volume of term loans and lines of credit we extend to our customers;\n\u2022\nimprove the terms on which we lend to our customers as our business becomes more efficient;\n\u2022\nincrease the effectiveness of our direct marketing, as well as our strategic partner and funding advisor program customer acquisition channels;\n\u2022\nincrease repeat borrowing by existing customers;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop and deploy new products;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully maintain our diversified funding strategy, including through the OnDeck Marketplace and future securitization transactions;\n\u2022\nfavorably compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of lending to small businesses;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the credit market;\n\u2022\neffectively manage the growth of our business;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully expand our business into adjacent markets; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully expand internationally.\nWe may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur recent, rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur gross revenue grew from $25.6 million in 2012 to $65.2 million in 2013 and $158.1 million in 2014. We expect that, in the future, even if our revenue continues to increase, our rate of revenue growth will decline.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\npersonnel, including expanding our technology and analytics team and significant increases to the total compensation we pay our employees as we grow our employee headcount;\n\u2022\nmarketing, including expenses relating to increased direct marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including the continued development of our platform and OnDeck Score;\n\u2022\ndiversification of funding sources, including through OnDeck Marketplace;\n\u2022\nexpansion into new markets, including international geographies;\n\u2022\noffice space, as we increase the space we need for our growing employee base; and\n\u2022\ngeneral administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nIn addition, our historical rapid growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we add additional staff, and we will need to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our financial results will suffer.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWe generated net losses of $16.8 million, $24.4 million and $18.7 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $127.1 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our marketing and sales operations and technology and analytics team, increase our customer service and general loan servicing capabilities, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our transition to and operation as a public company, lease additional space for our growing employee base, upgrade our data center infrastructure and expand into new markets. In addition, we record our loan loss provision as an expense to account for the possibility that all loans may not be repaid in full. Because we incur a given loan loss expense at the time that we issue the loan, we expect the aggregate amount of this expense to grow as we increase the number and total amount of loans we make to our customers.\nOur efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this report, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.\nWorsening economic conditions may result in decreased demand for our loans, cause our customers\u2019 default rates to increase and harm our operating results.\nUncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets, historically have created a difficult environment for companies in the lending industry. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may have a detrimental impact on our operating performance. These factors include general economic conditions, unemployment levels, energy costs and interest rates, as well as events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and catastrophes.\nOur customers are small businesses. Accordingly, our customers have historically been, and may in the future remain, more likely to be affected or more severely affected than large enterprises by adverse economic conditions. These conditions may result in a decline in the demand for our loans by potential customers or higher default rates by our existing customers. If a customer defaults on a loan payable to us, the loan enters a collections process where our systems and collections teams initiate contact with the customer for payments owed. If a loan is subsequently charged off, we generally sell the loan to a third-party collection agency and receive only a small fraction of the remaining amount payable to us in exchange for this sale.\nThere can be no assurance that economic conditions will remain favorable for our business or that demand for our loans or default rates by our customers will remain at current levels. Reduced demand for our loans would\nnegatively impact our growth and revenue, while increased default rates by our customers may inhibit our access to capital, hinder the growth of our OnDeck Marketplace and negatively impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have received a large number of applications from potential customers who do not satisfy the requirements for an OnDeck loan. If an insufficient number of qualified small businesses apply for our loans, our growth and revenue could decline.\nMany of our strategic partnerships are nonexclusive and subject to termination options that, if terminated, could harm the growth of our customer base and negatively affect our financial performance. Additionally, these partners are concentrated and the departure of a significant partner could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe rely on strategic partners for referrals of an increasing portion of our customers and our growth depends in part on the growth of these referrals. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, loans issued to customers referred to us by our strategic partners constituted 5.5%, 9.2% and 13.9% of our total loan originations, respectively. Many of our strategic partnerships do not contain exclusivity provisions that would prevent such partners from providing leads to competing companies. In addition, the agreements governing these partnerships contain termination provisions that, if exercised, would terminate our relationship with these partners. These agreements also contain no requirement that a partner refer us any minimum number of leads. There can be no assurance that these partners will not terminate our relationship with them or continue referring business to us in the future, and a termination of the relationship or reduction in leads referred to us would have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results.\nIn addition, a small number of strategic partners refer to us a significant portion of the loans made within this channel. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, loans issued to customers referred to us by our top four strategic partners constituted 4.7%, 6.8% and 9.8% of our total loan originations, respectively. In the event that one or more of these significant strategic partners terminated our relationship or reduced the number of leads provided to us, our business would be harmed.\nTo the extent that Funding Advisor Program partners or direct sales agents mislead loan applicants or are engaging or previously engaged in disreputable behavior, our reputation may be harmed and we may face liability.\nWe rely on third-party independent advisors, including business loan brokers, which we call Funding Advisor Program partners, or FAPs, for referrals of a substantial portion of the customers to whom we issue loans. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, loans issued to customers whose applications were submitted to us via the FAP channel constituted 75.1%, 56.4% and 41.4% of our total loan originations, respectively. Historically, our practice has been to conduct a personal criminal background check on one of the authorized representatives of each prospective FAPs as one element of the FAP application process; however, we have not performed such checks on all employees or agents of a FAP who might be involved in the marketing and sale of our products and we have not conducted any background checks with respect to any FAPs that joined the Funding Adviser Program before 2010 or who had an annual revenue greater than $15 million. Going forward, we will enhance the scope and nature of the due diligence applied to prospective FAPs and retroactively to existing FAPs.\nBecause FAPs earn fees on a commission basis, FAPs may have an incentive to mislead loan applicants, facilitate the submission by loan applicants of false application data or engage in other disreputable behavior so as to earn additional commissions on those inaccurate loan applications. In addition, while we strictly prohibit, by policy and contract, all FAPs from charging customers any additional unauthorized fees, it is possible that some FAPs may attempt to charge such fees despite our prohibition. We also rely on our direct sales agents for customer acquisition in our direct marketing channel, and these sales agents may also engage in disreputable behavior to increase our customer base. If FAPs or our direct sales agents mislead our customers or engage in any other disreputable behavior, our customers are less likely to be satisfied with their experience and to become repeat customers, and we may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation, each of which could harm our reputation\nand operating performance. We have been subject to negative publicity related to our FAP channel, including regarding the alleged backgrounds of certain of their employees. If we continue to experience such negative publicity, our ability to continue to increase our revenue could be impaired and our business could otherwise be materially and negatively impacted.\nWe are also implementing certain enhanced contractual provisions and compliance-related measures related to our funding advisor channel, in addition to enhanced due diligence and screening procedures. While these measures are intended to improve certain aspects and reduce the risks of how we work with funding advisors and how they work with our customers, and our plans have progressed, we cannot assure you of the exact timing that all the measures will be implemented, whether they will work as intended, that other compliance-related concerns will not emerge in the future, that the funding advisors will comply with these measures, and that these measures will not negatively impact our business from this channel, including our financial performance, or have other unintended or negative impacts on our business beyond the FAP channel, such as with existing or potential strategic partners, customers or funding sources.\nWe pay commissions to our strategic partners and FAPs upfront and generally do not recover them in the event the related loan or line of credit is eventually charged-off.\nWe pay commissions to strategic partners and FAPs on the term loans and lines of credit we originate through these channels. We pay these commissions at the time the term loan is funded or line of credit is opened. However, we generally do not require that this commission be repaid to us in the event of a default on a term loan or line of credit. While we generally discontinue working with strategic partners and FAPs that refer customers to us that ultimately have unacceptably high levels of defaults, to the extent that our strategic partners and FAPs are not at risk of forfeiting their commissions in the event of defaults, they may to an extent be indifferent to the riskiness of the potential customers that they refer to us.\nOur business may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit.\nWe depend on debt facilities and other forms of debt in order to finance most of the loans we make to our customers. However, we cannot guarantee that these financing sources will continue to be available beyond the current maturity date of each debt facility, on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we make to customers on our platform increases, we may require the expansion of our borrowing capacity on our existing debt facilities and other debt arrangements or the addition of new sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are outside of our control. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breaches of financial or performance covenants under our debt agreements, which could reduce or terminate our access to institutional funding. In addition, we began selling loans to third parties via our OnDeck Marketplace in October 2013 and completed our first securitization transaction in May 2014. There can be no assurance that investors will continue to purchase our loans via our OnDeck Marketplace or that we will be able to successfully access the securitization markets again. Furthermore, because we only recently began accessing these sources of capital, there is a greater possibility that these sources of capital may not be available in the future. In the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking and financial system, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets. If we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nIf the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer\u2019s qualification to receive a loan and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by loan applicants. To the extent that these applicants provide information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, the OnDeck Score may not\naccurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources is a significant component of the OnDeck Score and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, we use identity and fraud checks analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each customer\u2019s identity. From time to time in the past, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could also fail in the future, and fraud may occur. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, operating results and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nOur current level of interest rate spread and gains of sales of loans in our OnDeck Marketplace program may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or gains on sales of loans could reduce our profitability.\nWe earn a substantial majority of our revenues from interest payments on the loans we make to our customers. Financial institutions and other funding sources provide us with the capital to fund these term loans and lines of credit and charge us interest on funds that we draw down. In the event that the spread between the rate at which we lend to our customers and the rate at which we borrow from our lenders decreases, our financial results and operating performance will be harmed. The interest rates we charge to our customers and pay to our lenders could each be affected by a variety of factors, including access to capital based on our business performance, the volume of loans we make to our customers, competition and regulatory requirements. These interest rates may also be affected by a change over time in the mix of the types of products we sell to our customers and investors and a shift among our channels of customer acquisition. Interest rate changes may adversely affect our business forecasts and expectations and are highly sensitive to many macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession, the state of the credit markets, changes in market interest rates, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. In addition, we generate gains on sales of loans to institutional investors through our OnDeck Marketplace program. The prices we are able to charge for loans we sell are based on a variety of factors, including the terms and credit risk associated with loans, investor demand and other factors. If these variables or others were to change, we might be required to reduce our sales prices on loans, sell fewer loans or both, which could reduce our gains on sales of loans in the OnDeck Marketplace program. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or gains on sale of loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements are found to be unenforceable, we may be found to be in violation of state interest rate limit laws.\nAlthough the federal government does not currently regulate the maximum interest rates that may be charged on commercial loan transactions, many states have enacted interest rate limit laws specifying the maximum legal interest rate at which loans can be made in the state. We apply Virginia law to the underlying agreement for loans that we originate because our loans are underwritten and entered into in the state of Virginia, where our underwriting, servicing, operations and collections teams are headquartered.\nVirginia does not limit interest rates on commercial loans of $5,000 or more. Assuming a court were to recognize this choice of law provision, Virginia law would be applied to a dispute between the customer and us regardless of where the customer is located. We intend for Virginia law to control over state interest rate limit laws that would otherwise be applicable to these loans. We are not aware of any broad-based legal challenges to date to the applicability of Virginia law to these loans or the loans of other companies. However, many laws to which we are subject were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not expressly contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet such as the applicability of laws to online transactions, including in our case, the origination of loans. In addition, many laws that do reference the internet\nare being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict whether a court may seek to apply a different choice of law to our loans or to otherwise invalidate the applicability of Virginia law to our loans. If the applicability of Virginia law to these loans were challenged, and these loans were found to be governed by the laws of another state, and such other state has an interest rate limit law that prohibits the interest rate in effect with respect to such loans, the obligations of our customers to pay all or a portion of the interest and principal on these loans could be found unenforceable. A judgment that the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements is unenforceable also could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, penalties, damage to our reputation, trigger repurchase obligations, negatively impact the terms of our future loans and harm our operating results. Likewise, a judgment that the choice of law provision in other commercial loan agreements is unenforceable could result in challenges to our choice of law provision and that could result in costly and time-consuming litigation. In addition, it could cause us to incur substantial additional expense to comply with the laws of various states, including either our licensing as a lender in the various states, or requiring us to place more loans through our issuing bank partners.\nIssuing bank partners with whom we have agreements lend to customers in certain states. If our relationships with issuing bank partners were to end, then we may have to comply with additional restrictions, and certain states may require us to obtain a lending license.\nIn states that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we make term loans directly to customers pursuant to Virginia law, which is the governing law we require in the underlying loan agreements with our customers. However, nine states and jurisdictions, namely Alaska, California, Maryland, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., require a license to make certain commercial loans and may not honor a Virginia choice of law. They assert either that their own licensing laws and requirements should generally apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks or apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks of certain principal amounts or with certain interest rates or other terms. In such states and jurisdictions and in some other circumstances, term loans are made by an issuing bank partner that is not subject to state licensing, primarily BofI Federal Bank (a federally chartered bank), and may be sold to us. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, loans made by issuing bank partners constituted 21.1%, 16.1% and 15.9%, respectively, of our total loan originations. These loans are not governed by Virginia law, but rather the laws of the issuing bank partner\u2019s home state, California law in the case of BofI Federal Bank. The remainder of our term loans provide that they are to be governed by Virginia law. Our issuing bank partner currently originates all of our loans in California, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont as well as some loans in other states and jurisdictions in addition to those listed above. Although such states and jurisdictions may have licensing requirements and/or interest rate caps that purport to apply to some or all commercial loans, all such licensing requirements and/or caps that would otherwise be applicable are federally preempted when these loans are originated by our federally chartered issuing bank partner. As a result, loans originated by our issuing bank partner are generally priced the same as loans originated by us under Virginia law. While the other 42 U.S. states where we originate loans currently honor our Virginia choice of law, future legal changes could result in any one or more of those states no longer honoring our Virginia choice of law. In that case, we could address the legal change in a manner similar to how we approach the nine states and jurisdictions that currently require licensing and may not honor a Virginia choice of law, or we could consider other approaches, including licensing.\nIf we were to seek to make loans directly in those states referenced in the paragraph above or if we were otherwise not able to work with an issuing bank partner, we would have to attempt to comply with the laws of these states in other ways, including through obtaining lending licenses. Compliance with the laws of such states could be costly, and if we are unable to obtain such licenses, our loan volume could substantially decrease and our revenues, growth and profitability would be harmed. In addition, if our activities under the current arrangement with issuing bank partners were deemed to constitute lending within any such jurisdiction, we could be found to have engaged in impermissible lending within such jurisdictions. As a result, we could be subjected to fines and other penalties, all or a portion of the principal and interest charged on the applicable loans could be found to be unenforceable and, to the extent it is determined that such loans were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we could be obligated to repurchase any loans from our debt facilities and OnDeck\nMarketplace participants that failed to comply with such legal requirements. Any finding that we engaged in lending in states in which we are unlicensed to do so could lead to litigation, harm our reputation and negatively impact our operating expenses and profitability.\nAn increase in customer default rates may reduce our overall profitability and could also affect our ability to attract institutional funding. Further, historical default rates may not be indicative of future results.\nCustomer default rates may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the control of individual customers. In particular, loss rates on customer loans may increase due to factors such as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer and business confidence, commercial real estate values, the value of the U.S. dollar, energy prices, changes in consumer and business spending, the number of personal bankruptcies, disruptions in the credit markets and other factors. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we instituted a program that allowed us to offer both our term loan and line of credit products to the same customers, subject to customary credit and loan underwriting procedures. To the extent that our customers borrow from us under both products and default, our losses could be greater than if we had offered them only one product. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 28.5% of our total loans outstanding related to customers with fewer than five years of operating history. While our OnDeck Score is designed to establish that, notwithstanding such limited operating and financial history, customers would be a reasonable credit risk, our loans may nevertheless be expected to have a higher default rate than loans made to customers with more established operating and financial histories. In addition, if default rates reach certain levels, the principal of our securitized notes may be required to be paid down, and we may no longer be able to borrow from our debt facilities to fund future loans. In addition, if customer default rates increase beyond forecast levels, returns for investors in our OnDeck Marketplace program will decline and demand by investors to participate in this program will decrease, each of which will harm our reputation, operating results and profitability.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risk, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential customers do not adequately identify potential risks, the OnDeck Score produced would not adequately represent the risk profile of such customers and could result in higher risk than anticipated. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our use of our proprietary OnDeck Score technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks that we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.\nWe rely on our proprietary credit-scoring model in the forecasting of loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nIn making a decision whether to extend credit to prospective customers, we rely heavily on our OnDeck Score, the credit score generated by our proprietary credit-scoring model and decisioning system, an empirically derived suite of statistical models built using third-party data, data from our customers and our credit experience gained through monitoring the performance of our customers over time. If our proprietary credit-scoring model and decisioning system fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness of our customers, or if our proprietary cash flow analytics system fails to assess prospective customers\u2019 financial ability to repay their loans, or if any portion of the information pertaining to the prospective customer is false, inaccurate or incomplete, and our systems did not detect such falsities, inaccuracies or incompleteness, or any or all of the other components of the credit decision process described herein fails, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. Furthermore, if we are unable to access the third-party data used in our OnDeck Score, or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate potential customers will be compromised, and we may be unable to effectively\npredict probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we make errors in the development and validation of any of the models or tools we use to underwrite the loans that we securitize or sell to investors, these investors may experience higher delinquencies and losses and we may be subject to liability. Moreover, if future performance of our customers\u2019 loans differs from past experience (driven by factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic factors, policy actions by regulators, lending by other institutions and reliability of data used in the underwriting process), which experience has informed the development of the underwriting procedures employed by us, delinquency rates and losses to investors of our securitized debt from our customers\u2019 loans could increase, thereby potentially subjecting us to liability. This inability to effectively forecast loss rates could also inhibit our ability to borrow from our debt facilities, which could further hinder our growth and harm our financial performance.\nOur allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb loan losses.\nWe face the risk that our customers will fail to repay their loans in full. We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for loan losses, the increase of which results in a charge to our earnings as a provision for loan losses. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts and establishment of loan losses are also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our historical experience, and unlike traditional banks, we are not subject to periodic review by bank regulatory agencies of our allowance for loan losses. As a result, there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be comparable to that of traditional banks subject to regulatory oversight or sufficient to absorb losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increasing competition and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe compete with other companies that lend to small businesses. These companies include traditional banks, merchant cash advance providers and newer, technology-enabled lenders. In addition, other technology companies that primarily lend to individual consumers have already begun to focus, or may in the future focus, their efforts on lending to small businesses.\nIn some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with specific industries such as restaurants. In other cases, some competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients, and some competitors may offer a specialized set of specific products or services. Many of these competitors have significantly more resources and greater brand recognition than we do and may be able to attract customers more effectively than we do.\nWhen new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share or ability to exploit new market opportunities. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges. Further, to the extent that the commissions we pay to our strategic partners and funding advisors are not competitive with those paid by our competitors, whether on new loans or renewals or both, these partners and advisors may choose to direct their business elsewhere. Those competitive pressures could also result in us reducing the origination fees or interest we charge to our customers. All of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth.\nTo date, we have derived our revenue from a limited number of products and markets. Our efforts to expand our market reach and product portfolio may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.\nWe offer term loans and lines of credit to our customers in the United States and term loans to our customers in Canada. Many of our competitors offer a more diverse set of products to small businesses and in additional international markets. While we intend to eventually broaden the scope of products that we offer to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts. Failure to broaden the scope of products we offer to potential customers may inhibit the growth of repeat business from our customers and harm our operating results. There also can be no guarantee that we will be successful with respect to our current efforts in Canada, as well as any further expansion beyond the United States and Canada, if we decide to attempt such expansion at all, which may also inhibit the growth of our business.\nIn connection with our sale of loans to our subsidiaries and through OnDeck Marketplace, we make representations and warranties concerning the loans we sell. If those representations and warranties are not correct, we could be required to repurchase the loans. Any significant required repurchases could have an adverse effect upon our ability to operate and fund our business.\nIn our asset-backed securitization facility and our other asset-backed revolving debt facilities, we transfer loans to our subsidiaries and make numerous representations and warranties concerning the loans we transfer including representations and warranties that the loans meet the eligibility requirements. We also make representations and warranties in connection with the loans we sell through OnDeck Marketplace. If those representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to repurchase the loans. In connection with OnDeck Marketplace and our asset-backed revolving debt facilities, we have been required to repurchase an immaterial amount of loans. Failure to repurchase such loans when required would constitute an event of default under the securitization and other asset-backed facilities and may constitute a termination event under the applicable OnDeck Marketplace agreement. There is no assurance, however, that we would have adequate resources to make such repurchases or, if we did make the repurchases, that such event might not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not have adequate funding capacity in the event that an unforeseen number of customers to whom we have extended a line of credit decide to draw their lines at the same time.\nOur current capacity to fund our customers\u2019 lines of credit through existing debt facilities is limited. Accordingly, we maintain cash available to fund our customers\u2019 lines of credit based on the amount that we foresee these customers drawing down. For example, if we make available a line of credit for $15,000 to a small business, we may only reserve a portion of this amount at any given time for immediate drawdown. We base the amount that we reserve on our analysis of aggregate portfolio demand and the historical activity of customers using the line of credit product. However, if we inaccurately predict the number of customers that draw down on their lines of credit at a certain time, or if these customers draw down in greater amounts than we forecast, we may not have enough funds available to lend to them. Failure to provide funds drawn down by our customers on their lines of credit may expose us to liability, damage our reputation and inhibit our growth.\nAs a result of becoming a public company in December 2014, we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for 2015 and subsequent years. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are currently evaluating our internal controls, identifying and remediating deficiencies in those internal controls and documenting the results of our evaluation, testing and remediation.\nIn connection with our preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, which were issued on December 4, 2014, we identified four control deficiencies that did not rise to the level of a material weakness, on an individual basis or in the aggregate, but did represent significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. A control deficiency is considered a significant deficiency if it represents a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a company\u2019s financial reporting. The particular deficiencies related to the effectiveness of our information technology controls, the formalization of key controls in certain operations and finance processes relating to the retention, documentation and evidence of reviews and approvals, the timely reconciliation of certain sub-ledgers and ledgers, and the financial statement close process, specifically the process of recording prepaid assets and expenses accurately. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the significant deficiency relating to the effectiveness of our information technology controls, including designing and implementing policies and procedures to address this deficiency. We have implemented new policies and procedures designed to address the other three significant deficiencies and are in the process of testing the efficacy of those actions. Until our testing processes are complete, we will not have a sufficient basis to conclude whether those actions were effective to remediate one or more of those three significant deficiencies. The actions we have taken and plan to take are subject to ongoing senior management review and audit committee oversight.\nIn the course of preparing our financial statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, we assessed an additional control deficiency that we identified as a significant deficiency. This significant deficiency relates to the accuracy of certain manual spreadsheets. We are in the process of designing and implementing changes to our policies and procedures to remedy this significant deficiency.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken, or will take, to remediate these significant deficiencies will be effective. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we have identified all significant deficiencies or that we will not in the future have additional significant deficiencies or identify material weaknesses. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not evaluated any of the measures we have taken, or that we propose to take, to address these significant deficiencies discussed above.\nIn addition to the specific actions we have taken or will take to address the foregoing significant deficiencies, because our business has grown and we are a public company, we are seeking to transition to a more developed internal control environment that incorporates increased automation.\nWe also may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified or if we are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest to management\u2019s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe will be required to disclose material changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jump Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our results of operations and our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and board members.\nAs a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company and these expenses will increase after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made, and will continue to make, some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, beginning with the year ending December 31, 2015, we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. As long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may elect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, when our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. We expect to have in place accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources that will allow us to maintain compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at the end of any phase-in periods permitted by the NYSE, the SEC, and the JOBS Act. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal control from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees whom we need to support our business.\nCompetition for highly skilled engineering and data analytics personnel is extremely intense, and we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in many areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and\nsalary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In particular, candidates making employment decisions, specifically in high-technology industries, often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. Any significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled technical, financial and marketing personnel.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional key personnel to grow our business, and the loss of key employees or inability to hire key personnel could harm our business.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Noah Breslow, our Chief Executive Officer. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nSince our founding, we have raised substantial equity and debt financing to support the growth of our business. Because we intend to continue to make investments to support the growth of our business, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including increasing our marketing expenditures to improve our brand awareness, developing new products or services or further improving existing products and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, our agreements with our lenders contain restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, and any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve further restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur agreements with our lenders contain a number of early payment triggers and covenants. A breach of such triggers or covenants or other terms of such agreements could result in an early amortization, default, and/or acceleration of the related funding facilities which could materially impact our operations.\nPrimary funding sources available to support the maintenance and growth of our business include, among others, an asset-backed securitization facility, other asset-backed revolving debt facilities and corporate debt. Our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by our inability to comply with various covenants and other specified requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders which could result in the early amortization, default and/or acceleration of our existing facilities. Such covenants and requirements include financial covenants, portfolio performance covenants and other events. For a description of these covenants, requirements and events, see section titled Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nDuring an early amortization period or occurrence of an event of default, principal collections from the loans in our asset-backed facilities would be applied to repay principal under such facilities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loans. During the occurrence of an event of default under any of our facilities, the applicable lenders could accelerate the related debt and such lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit under the related facility would terminate. Our asset-backed securitization trust would not be able to issue future series out of such securitization. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such facilities, the applicable lenders could seek remedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities. A default under one facility could also lead to default under other facilities due to cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nAn early amortization event or event of default would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loans, and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or which might not be available when needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to curtail the origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under our facilities.\nWe act as servicer with respect to our facilities. If we default in our servicing obligations, an early amortization event of default could occur with respect to the applicable facility and we could be replaced as servicer.\nThe lending industry is highly regulated. Changes in regulations or in the way regulations are applied to our business could adversely affect our business.\nThe regulatory environment in which lending institutions operate has become increasingly complex, and following the financial crisis of 2008, supervisory efforts to enact and apply relevant laws, regulations and policies have become more intense. Changes in laws or regulations or the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to us could adversely affect our ability to operate in the manner in which we currently conduct business or make it more difficult or costly for us to originate or otherwise make additional loans, or for us to collect payments on loans by subjecting us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or otherwise. For example, if our loans were determined for any reason not to be commercial loans, we would be subject to many additional requirements, and our fees and interest arrangements could be challenged by regulators or our customers. A material failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our ability to originate and service loans and perform our obligations to investors and other constituents.\nA proceeding relating to one or more allegations or findings of our violation of such laws could result in modifications in our methods of doing business that could impair our ability to collect payments on our loans or\nto acquire additional loans or could result in the requirement that we pay damages and/or cancel the balance or other amounts owing under loans associated with such violation. We cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted against us in the future. To the extent it is determined that the loans we make to our customers were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we would be obligated to repurchase from the entity holding the applicable loan any such loan that fails to comply with legal requirements. We may not have adequate resources to make such repurchases.\nFinancial regulatory reform relating to asset-backed securities has not been fully implemented and could have a significant impact on our ability to access the asset-backed market.\nWe rely upon asset-backed financing for a significant portion of our funds with which to carry on our business. Asset-backed securities and the securitization markets were heavily affected by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010 and have also been a focus of increased regulation by the SEC. However, some of the regulations to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been finalized and other asset-backed regulations that have been adopted by the SEC have delayed effective dates. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the implementation of rules requiring securitizers or originators to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate. In October 2014, the SEC adopted final rules in relation to such risk retention, but such rules will not be effective with respect to our transactions until late in 2016. In addition, the SEC previously proposed separate rules which would affect the disclosure requirements for registered as well as unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities. The SEC has recently adopted final rules which affect the disclosure requirements for registered issuances of asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases and debt securities. However, final rules that would affect the disclosure requirements for registered issuances of asset-backed securities backed by other types of collateral or for unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities have not been adopted. Any of such rules if implemented could adversely affect our ability to access the asset-backed market or our cost of accessing that market.\nOur success and future growth depend in part on our successful marketing efforts and increased brand awareness. Failure to effectively use our brand to convert sales may negatively affect our growth and our financial performance.\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be continued market penetration through our direct marketing channel. To achieve this growth, we anticipate relying heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of the OnDeck brand with potential customers. The goal of this marketing and advertising is to increase the strength, recognition and trust in the OnDeck brand, drive more unique visitors to submit loan applications on our website, and ultimately increase the number of loans made to our customers. We incurred expenses of $18.1 million and $33.2 million on sales and marketing in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we grow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in website traffic and in the number of loans made by visitors to our platform, or if we discontinue our broad marketing campaigns, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer.\nOur reputation is very important to attracting new customers to our platform as well as securing repeat lending to existing customers. While we believe that we have a good reputation and that we provide our customers with a superior experience, there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain a good relationship with our customers or avoid negative publicity. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from our conduct of business, negative publicity, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our\nfinancial reporting or compliance with SEC and New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, security breaches or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches of customers\u2019 confidential information that we store may harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nWe store our customers\u2019 bank information, credit information and other sensitive data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could cause the theft and criminal use of this data. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers\u2019 data, our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and we could lose customers.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, collect, process, transmit, store and use a large volume of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data from customers and potential customers. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy, recording telephone calls and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and sensitive data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, address legal claims and sustain monetary penalties and/or other harms to our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues in the United States and internationally is constantly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The interpretation and application of such laws is often uncertain, and such laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our current policies and practices or require changes to the features of our platform. If either we or our third party service providers are unable to address any privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in additional costs and liability, damage our reputation and harm our business.\nOur ability to collect payment on loans and maintain accurate accounts may be adversely affected by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions.\nThe automated nature of our platform may make it an attractive target for hacking and potentially vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our platform, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, in which case there would be an increased risk of fraud or identity theft, and we may experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced loan. In addition, the software that we have developed to use in our daily operations is highly complex and may contain undetected technical errors that could cause our computer systems to fail. Because each loan\nthat we make involves our proprietary automated underwriting process, any failure of our computer systems involving our automated underwriting process and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our automated underwriting process could compromise our ability to accurately evaluate potential customers, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result in disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we make to our customers.\nAdditionally, if a hacker were able to access our secure files, he or she might be able to gain access to the personal information of our customers. While we have taken steps to prevent such activity from affecting our platform, if we are unable to prevent such activity, we may be subject to significant liability, negative publicity and a material loss of customers, all of which may negatively affect our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to collect payment on and service the loans we make to our customers.\nWe rely on unaffiliated banks for the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transaction process used to disburse the proceeds of newly originated loans to our customers and to automatically collect scheduled payments on the loans. As we are not a bank, we do not have the ability to directly access the ACH payment network, and must therefore rely on an FDIC-insured depository institution to process our transactions, including loan payments. Although we have built redundancy between these banks\u2019 services, if we cannot continue to obtain such services from our current institutions or elsewhere, or if we cannot transition to another processor quickly, our ability to process payments will suffer. If we fail to adequately collect amounts owing in respect of the loans, as a result of the loss of direct debiting or otherwise, then payments to us may be delayed or reduced and our revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nWe rely on data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these data centers could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our service to our customers.\nWe currently serve our customers from two third-party data center hosting facilities in Piscataway, New Jersey and Denver, Colorado. The continuous availability of our service depends on the operations of these facilities, on a variety of network service providers, on third-party vendors and on data center operations staff. In addition, we depend on the ability of our third-party facility providers to protect the facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. If there are any lapses of service or damage to the facilities, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed.\nWe designed our system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our services. Design and mechanical errors, failure to follow operations protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our platform. Any such interruptions or delays, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue and subject us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nDemand for our loans may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological changes.\nWe operate in a nascent industry characterized by rapidly evolving technology and frequent product introductions. We rely on our proprietary technology to make our platform available to customers, determine the creditworthiness of loan applicants, and service the loans we make to customers. In addition, we may\nincreasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new products, expand our current products into new markets, and continue to streamline the lending process. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior customer experience, customers\u2019 demand for our loans may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed.\nIt may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur ability to lend to our customers depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology, including our use of the OnDeck Score. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful.\nIn addition, our platform may infringe upon claims of third-party intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. The costs of defending any such claims or litigation could be significant and, if we are unsuccessful, could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, which would negatively impact our financial performance. Furthermore, our technology may become obsolete, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop, obtain or use new technologies to adapt our platform to compete with other lending platforms as they develop. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, or if the platform becomes obsolete, our ability to maintain our platform, make loans or perform our servicing obligations on the loans could be adversely affected.\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nWe incorporate open source software into our proprietary platform and into other processes supporting our business. Such open source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of the platform and negatively affects our business operations.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If portions of our proprietary platform are determined to be subject to an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or change our business activities. In addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nWe may evaluate, and potentially consummate, acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and\ncostly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. We also have never acquired a business before and therefore lack experience in integrating new technology and personnel. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of technology, product development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of the acquired company\u2019s customers to our platform;\n\u2022\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of loans or intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results in a given period;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32.2 million as of December 31, 2014. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2027. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $26.1 million against our net deferred tax asset.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d of a corporation. Events which may cause limitation in the amount of the net operating losses and other tax attributes that are able to be utilized in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period, which has occurred as a result of historical ownership changes. Accordingly, our ability to use pre-change net operating loss and certain other attributes are limited as prescribed under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Therefore, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to reduce our federal income tax liability with our existing net operating losses is subject to limitation. Although we believe that our initial public offering did not result in another cumulative ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, we do not believe that any resulting limitation will further limit our ability to ultimately utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes in a material way. Future offerings, as well as other future ownership\nchanges that may be outside our control could potentially result in further limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax attributes. Accordingly, achieving profitability may not result in a full release of the valuation allowance.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, flood, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nEvents beyond our control may damage our ability to accept our customers\u2019 applications, underwrite loans, maintain our platform or perform our servicing obligations. In addition, these catastrophic events may negatively affect customers\u2019 demand for our loans. Such events include, but are not limited to, fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, computer viruses and telecommunications failures. Despite any precautions we may take, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, such disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and cause lengthy delays which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently are not able to switch instantly to our backup center in the event of failure of the main server site. This means that an outage at one facility could result in our system being unavailable for a significant period of time. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. A system outage or data loss could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, relationships with strategic partners, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nthe impact of securities analysts\u2019 reports or other publicity regarding our business or industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in demand for our loans;\n\u2022\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. At December 31, 2014, we had 69,120,137 shares of common stock outstanding of which 11,500,000 shares were freely tradable.\nIn connection with our initial public offering, we and all of our directors and officers and substantially all of our equity holders agreed not to offer, sell or agree to sell, directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock without the permission of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated until June 15, 2015. When this lock-up period expires, we and our locked-up security holders will be able to sell our shares in the public market. In addition, the underwriters may, in their sole discretion, release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. Sales of a substantial number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up, or the perception that such sales may occur, or early release of the lock-up, could cause our share price to fall or make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our common stock.\nAt December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 56,832,941 shares of our common stock (including shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock), or their permitted transferees, will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nInsiders and large stockholders have or could have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 62.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nHowever, for so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (i) the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe also expect that these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us as a public company to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur\nsubstantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Risk Management Committee and as qualified executive officers.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and are taking advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares, change their opinion of our shares or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.", "PERMNO": 15110, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "ONDK"}
