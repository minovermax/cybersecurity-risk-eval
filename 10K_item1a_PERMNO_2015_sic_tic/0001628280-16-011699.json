RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCertain elements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 formula rates can be and have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Regulated Operating Subsidiaries provide transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to\ncalculate their respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 rates approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of their respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative in a proceeding under Section 206 of the FPA. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries of their projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to their approved formula rate templates under the Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' formula rate implementation protocols. End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula. This could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts collected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn November 2013, certain parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC under Section 206 of the FPA, requesting that the FERC find the base rate of return on equity for all MISO transmission owners, including ITCTransmission, METC and ITC Midwest, to be unjust and unreasonable. The joint complainants sought a FERC order reducing the base rate of return on equity used in the MISO transmission owners\u2019 formula transmission rate, reducing the targeted equity component of MISO transmission owners\u2019 capital structures and terminating the return on equity adders approved for ITCTransmission and METC. Although the FERC issued an order rejecting this complaint as to the capital structures and ITCTransmission's and METC\u2019s equity adders, a hearing was ordered on the complaint's allegations as to the base rate of return on equity for all MISO transmission owners. On December 22, 2015, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision recommending to the FERC a reduction in the base return on equity rate of the MISO transmission owners from 12.38% to 10.32%, with a maximum rate of 11.35%. The presiding administrative law judge's initial decision is a non-binding recommendation to FERC for resolution of the matters set for hearing. A decision on the complaint from FERC is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. In February 2015, an additional complaint was filed under Section 206 of the FPA seeking a FERC order reducing the base return on equity rate for all MISO transmission owners, including for our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, to 8.67%. A decision from FERC on the February 2015 complaint is anticipated in 2017. In each case, if any refunds are required, the refund effective date would be the date on which the related complaint was filed. In 2015 and 2014, we adjusted revenues downward to accrue for the refund liability based on our estimate of the outcome of these complaints. An unfavorable resolution of these complaints in excess of the amount accrued for the refund liability could significantly reduce our future revenues and net income and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur actual capital investment may be lower than planned, which would cause a lower than anticipated rate base and would therefore result in lower revenues and earnings compared to our current expectations. In addition, we expect to invest in strategic development opportunities to improve the efficiency and reliability of the transmission grid, but we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to initiate or complete any of these investments. In addition, we expect to incur expenses related to the pursuit of development opportunities, which may be higher than forecasted.\nEach of our operating subsidiaries\u2019 rate base, revenues and earnings are determined in part by additions to property, plant and equipment and when those additions are placed in service. We anticipate making significant capital investments over the next several years; however, the amounts could change significantly due to factors beyond our control. If our operating subsidiaries\u2019 capital investment and the resulting in-service property, plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason, our operating subsidiaries will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings to be lower than anticipated.\nWe are pursuing broader strategic development investment opportunities including those related to building regional transmission facilities and interconnections for generating resources, among others. Incumbent utilities or other transmission development entities may compete with us for regulatory approval to develop capital projects that we are pursuing. If we are unable to compete successfully for approval of these projects, our opportunities to expand our rate base and increase our revenues and earnings may become limited.\nAny capital investment at our operating subsidiaries or as a result of our broader strategic development initiatives may be lower than our published estimates due to, among other factors, the impact of actual loads, forecasted loads, regional economic conditions, weather conditions, union strikes, labor shortages, material and equipment prices and availability, our ability to obtain financing for such expenditures, if necessary, limitations on the amount of construction that can be undertaken on our system or transmission systems owned by others at any one time, regulatory requirements relating to our rate construct, environmental issues, siting, regional planning, cost recovery or other issues, or as a result of legal proceedings and variances between estimated and actual costs of construction contracts awarded and the potential for greater competition. Our ability to engage in construction projects resulting from pursuing these initiatives is subject to significant uncertainties, including the factors discussed above, and will depend on obtaining any necessary regulatory and other approvals for the project and for us to initiate construction, our achieving status as the builder of the project in some circumstances and other factors. Therefore, we can provide no assurance as to the actual level of investment we may achieve at our operating subsidiaries or as a result of the broader strategic development initiatives.\nIn addition, we expect to incur expenses to pursue strategic development investment opportunities. If these expenses are higher than anticipated, our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe regulations to which we are subject may limit our ability to raise capital and/or pursue acquisitions, development opportunities or other transactions or may subject us to liabilities.\nEach of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and, accordingly, is subject to regulation by the FERC. Approval of the FERC is required under Section 203 of the FPA for a disposition or acquisition of regulated public utility facilities, either directly or indirectly through a holding company. Such approval is also required to acquire a significant interest in securities of a public utility. Section 203 of the FPA also provides the FERC with explicit authority over utility holding companies\u2019 purchases or acquisitions of, and mergers or consolidations with, a public utility. Finally, each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries must also seek approval by the FERC under Section 204 of the FPA for issuances of its securities (including debt securities).\nWe are also pursuing development projects for construction of transmission facilities and interconnections with generating resources. These projects may require regulatory approval by Federal agencies, including the FERC, applicable RTOs and state and local regulatory agencies. Failure to secure such regulatory approval for new strategic development projects could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues. If we fail to obtain these approvals when necessary, we may incur liabilities for such failure.\nChanges in energy laws, regulations or policies could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEach of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is regulated by the FERC as a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the FPA and is a transmission owner in MISO or SPP. We cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries will be changed. In addition, the U.S. Congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could assign new responsibilities to the FERC, modify provisions of the FPA or provide the FERC or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters. We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies in the future. While our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to FERC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of rate regulation, changes in state laws affecting other matters, such as transmission siting and construction, could limit investment opportunities available to us.\nIf amounts billed for transmission service for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 transmission systems are lower than expected, or our actual revenue requirements are higher than expected, the timing of collection of our revenues would be delayed.\nIf amounts billed for transmission service are lower than expected, which could result from lower network load or point-to-point transmission service on our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 transmission systems due to a weak economy, changes in the nature or composition of the transmission assets of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and surrounding areas, poor transmission quality of neighboring transmission systems, or for any other reason, the timing of the collection of our revenue requirement would likely be delayed until such circumstances are adjusted through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries\u2019 formula rate templates. In addition, if the revenue requirements of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are higher than expected, due to higher actual expenditures compared to the forecasted expenditures used to develop their billing rates or for any\nother reason, the timing of the collection of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' revenue requirements would likely be delayed until such circumstances are reflected through the true-up mechanism in our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries' expected, formula rate templates. The effect of such under-collection would be to reduce the amount of our available cash resources from what we had expected, until such under-collection is corrected through the true-up mechanism in the formula rate template, which may require us to increase our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing our available borrowing capacity, and may require us to pay interest at a rate that exceeds the interest to which we are entitled in connection with the operation of the true-up mechanism.\nEach of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries depends on its primary customer for a substantial portion of its revenues, and any material failure by those primary customers to make payments for transmission services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nITCTransmission derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the transmission of electricity to DTE Electric\u2019s local distribution facilities. DTE Electric accounted for approximately 60.3% of ITCTransmission\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITCTransmission\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. DTE Electric is rated BBB+/stable and A2/stable by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. Similarly, Consumers Energy accounted for approximately 74.6% of METC\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and is expected to constitute the majority of METC\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. Consumers Energy is rated BBB+/stable and A3/stable by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. Further, IP&L accounted for approximately 78.5% of ITC Midwest\u2019s total billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and is expected to constitute the majority of ITC Midwest\u2019s revenues for the foreseeable future. IP&L is rated A-/stable and A3/negative by Standard and Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc., respectively. These percentages of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the collection of 2013 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2015 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2015 operating revenues, but will not be billed to our customers until 2017.\nAny material failure by DTE Electric, Consumers Energy or IP&L to make payments for transmission services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant amount of the land on which our assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, we must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete construction projects in a timely manner.\nMETC does not own the majority of the land on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of an Easement Agreement with Consumers Energy, METC pays annual rent of $10.0 million to Consumers Energy in exchange for rights-of-way, leases, fee interests and licenses which allow METC to use the land on which its transmission lines are located. Under the terms of the Easement Agreement, METC\u2019s easement rights could be eliminated if METC fails to meet certain requirements, such as paying contractual rent to Consumers Energy in a timely manner. Additionally, a significant amount of the land on which our other subsidiaries\u2019 assets are located is subject to easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances. As a result, they must comply with the provisions of various easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances, which may adversely impact their ability to complete their construction projects in a timely manner.\nWe contract with third parties to provide services for certain aspects of our business. If any of these agreements are terminated, we may face a shortage of labor or replacement contractors to provide the services formerly provided by these third parties.\nWe enter into various agreements and arrangements with third parties to provide services for construction, maintenance and operations of certain aspects of our business, which, if terminated, could result in a shortage of a readily available workforce to provide these services. If any of these agreements or arrangements is terminated for any reason, we may face difficulty finding a qualified replacement work force to provide such services, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to carry on our business and on our results of operations.\nHazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of our operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. We maintain property and casualty insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and to laws that can give rise to substantial liabilities from environmental contamination.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and hazardous materials, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities relating to investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including formerly owned or operated properties and sites where wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as properties we currently own or operate. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from noncompliance with applicable environmental laws. Under a number of environmental laws, such liabilities may also be joint and several, meaning that a party can be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Environmental requirements generally have become more stringent in recent years, and compliance with those requirements more expensive.\nWe have incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. Failure to comply with the extensive environmental laws and regulations applicable to us could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and remediation costs. Our assets and operations also involve the use of materials classified as hazardous, toxic or otherwise dangerous. Some of our facilities and properties are located near environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and habitats of endangered or threatened species. In addition, certain properties in which we operate are, or are suspected of being, affected by environmental contamination. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and liabilities concerning contamination or hazardous materials, may adversely affect our costs and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, claims have been made or threatened against electric utilities for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly related to exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with electric transmission and distribution lines. We cannot provide assurance that such claims will not be asserted against us or that, if determined in a manner adverse to our interests, such claims would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various regulatory requirements, including reliability standards; contract filing requirements; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and transaction approval requirements. Violations of these requirements, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in penalties that, under some circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe various regulatory requirements to which we are subject include reliability standards established by the NERC, which acts as the nation\u2019s Electric Reliability Organization approved by the FERC in accordance with Section 215 of the FPA. These standards address operation, planning and security of the bulk power system, including requirements with respect to real-time transmission operations, emergency operations, vegetation management, critical infrastructure protection and personnel training. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in monetary penalties as well as non-monetary sanctions. Monetary penalties vary based on an assigned risk factor for each potential violation, the severity of the violation and various other circumstances, such as whether the violation was intentional or concealed, whether there are repeated violations, the degree of the violator\u2019s cooperation in investigating and remediating the violation and the presence of a compliance program, and such penalties can be substantial. Non-monetary sanctions include potential limitations on the violator\u2019s activities or\noperation and placing the violator on a watchlist for major violators. Despite our best efforts to comply and the implementation of a compliance program intended to ensure reliability, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur that would result in material penalties or sanctions. If any of our subsidiaries were to violate the NERC reliability standards, even unintentionally, in any material way, any penalties or sanctions imposed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are also subject to requirements under Sections 203 and 205 of the FPA for approval of transactions; reporting, recordkeeping and accounting requirements; and for filing contracts related to the provision of jurisdictional services. Under FERC policy, failure to file jurisdictional agreements on a timely basis may result in foregoing the time value of revenues collected under the agreement, but not to the point where a loss would be incurred. The failure to obtain timely approval of transactions subject to FPA Section 203, or to comply with applicable reporting, recordkeeping or accounting requirements under FPA Section 205, could subject us to penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActs of war, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActs of war, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events may negatively affect our business, financial condition and cash flows in unpredictable ways, such as increased security measures and disruptions of markets. Energy related assets, including, for example, our transmission facilities and DTE Electric\u2019s, Consumers Energy\u2019s and IP&L\u2019s generation and distribution facilities that we interconnect with, may be at risk of acts of war, terrorist attacks and cyber attacks, as well as natural disasters, severe weather and other catastrophic events. In addition to any physical damage caused by such events, cyber attacks targeting our information systems could impair our records, networks, systems and programs, or transmit viruses to other systems. Such events or the threat of such events may increase costs associated with heightened security requirements. In addition, such events or threats may have a material effect on the economy in general and could result in a decline in energy consumption, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate and Financial Structure\nITC Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless we receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to pay dividends and fulfill our other cash obligations.\nAs a holding company with no business operations, ITC Holdings\u2019 material assets consist primarily of the stock and membership interests in our subsidiaries. Our only sources of cash to pay dividends to our shareholders are dividends and other payments received by us from time to time from our subsidiaries, proceeds raised from the sale of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our various credit agreements. Each of our subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct from us and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends to ITC Holdings\u2019 shareholders or otherwise. The ability of each of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us is subject to, among other things, the availability of funds, after taking into account capital expenditure requirements, the terms of its indebtedness, applicable state laws and regulations of the FERC and the FPA. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries target a FERC-approved capital structure of 60% equity and 40% debt that may limit the ability of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries to use net assets for the payment of dividends to ITC Holdings. While we currently intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, we have no obligation to do so. The payment of dividends is within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, anticipated cash needs and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe have a considerable amount of debt and our reliance on debt financing may limit our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and/or to obtain additional financing.\nWe have a considerable amount of debt and our consolidated indebtedness includes various debt securities and borrowings, which utilize indentures, revolving and term loan credit agreements and commercial paper, that we rely on as sources of capital and liquidity. This financing strategy can have several important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nIf future cash flows are insufficient, we may not be able to make principal or interest payments on our debt obligations, which could result in the occurrence of an event of default under one or more of those debt instruments.\n\u2022\nWe may need to increase our indebtedness in order to make the capital expenditures and other expenses or investments planned by us.\n\u2022\nOur indebtedness has the general effect of reducing our flexibility to react to changing business and economic conditions insofar as they affect our financial condition and, therefore, may pose substantial risk to our shareholders. A substantial portion of the dividends and payments in lieu of taxes we receive from our subsidiaries will be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby, reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and the payment of dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022\nIn the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation, our senior or subordinated creditors and the senior or subordinated creditors of our subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full prior to any distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe currently have debt instruments outstanding with short-term maturities or relatively short remaining maturities. Our ability to secure additional financing prior to or after these facilities mature, if needed, may be substantially restricted by the existing level of our indebtedness and the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. Additionally, the interest rates at which we might secure additional financings may be higher than our currently outstanding debt instruments or higher than forecasted at any point in time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nMarket conditions could affect our access to capital markets, restrict our ability to secure financing to make the capital expenditures and investments and pay other expenses planned by us which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the risks described above.\nCertain provisions in our debt instruments limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur debt instruments on a consolidated basis, including senior notes, secured notes, first mortgage bonds, revolving and term loan credit agreements and commercial paper, contain numerous financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ncreate and acquire subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our stock or on the stock or member capital of our subsidiaries.\nOur debt instruments also require us to meet certain financial ratios, such as maintaining certain debt to capitalization ratios. Our ability to comply with these and other requirements and restrictions may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or other events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any of our debt instruments could result in acceleration of related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.\nOur ability to access capital markets is important to our ability to operate our business. Increased scrutiny of the energy industry and the impact of regulation, as well as changes in our financial performance and unfavorable conditions in the capital markets could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our\nborrowing costs. A rating downgrade could also increase the interest we pay on commercial paper and under our revolving and term loan credit agreements.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, Michigan corporate law and our debt agreements may impede efforts by our shareholders to change the direction or management of our company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a proposed takeover. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or an acquisition at a price that our shareholders may find attractive. These provisions also may discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na restriction limiting market participants from voting or owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our president or the holders of 25% of the shares of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board to issue, without shareholder approval, common or preferred stock, including in connection with our implementation of any shareholders rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nIn addition, our revolving and term loan credit agreements provide that a change in a majority of ITC Holdings\u2019 board of directors that is not approved by the current ITC Holdings\u2019 directors or acquiring beneficial ownership of 35% or more of ITC Holdings outstanding common shares will constitute a default under those agreements.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation restrict market participants from voting or owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.\nCertain of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries have been granted favorable rate treatment by the FERC based on their independence from market participants. The FERC defines a \u201cmarket participant\u201d to include any person or entity that, either directly or through an affiliate, sells or brokers electricity, or provides ancillary services to an RTO. An affiliate, for these purposes, includes any person or entity that directly or indirectly owns, controls or holds with the power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a market participant. To help ensure that we and our subsidiaries will remain independent of market participants, our Articles of Incorporation impose certain restrictions on the ownership and voting of shares of our capital stock by market participants. In particular, the Articles of Incorporation provide that we are restricted from issuing any shares of capital stock or recording any transfer of shares if the issuance or transfer would cause any market participant, either individually or together with members of its \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in SEC beneficial ownership rules), to beneficially own 5% or more of any class or series of our capital stock. Additionally, if a market participant, together with its group members, acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of any series of the outstanding shares of our capital stock, such market participant or any shareholder who is a member of a group including a market participant will not be able to vote or direct or control the votes of shares representing 5% or more of any series of our outstanding capital stock. Finally, to the extent a market participant, together with its group members, acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of any series of our capital stock, our Articles of Incorporation allow our board of directors to redeem any shares of our capital stock so that, after giving effect to the redemption, the market participant, together with its group members, will cease to beneficially own 5% or more of that series of our outstanding capital stock.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nOn February 9, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into ITC Holdings, as a result of which ITC Holdings will become a subsidiary of FortisUS. In connection with the proposed Merger, we are subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, those set forth below. For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 11, 2016. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the February 11, 2016 Form 8-K.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to various conditions which, if not satisfied, may cause the Merger not to be completed in a timely manner or at all.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) approval by our shareholders of the Merger Agreement, (ii) approval by Fortis\u2019 shareholders of the issuance of shares of Fortis common stock to be issued in the Merger, (iii) obtaining certain regulatory and federal approvals including, among others, those of the FERC, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the United States Federal Trade Commission/Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, and various state utilities regulators, and (iv) the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the completion of the Merger. Governmental agencies may not approve the Merger, or may impose conditions to any such approval or require changes to the terms of the Merger. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger, imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Each party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party\u2019s covenants under the Merger Agreement, including, with respect to us, certain covenants regarding operation of our business prior to completion of the Merger. As a result of these conditions, we cannot provide assurance that the Merger will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nWe will continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred significant legal, advisory and financial services fees in connection with our board of directors\u2019 review of strategic alternatives and the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the Merger. We expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the satisfaction of the various conditions to closing, including seeking approval from our shareholders and from applicable regulatory agencies. Such costs may be material and could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Merger. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the Merger, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our stock price will likely fall to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed. In addition, the failure to complete the Merger may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business and generally must operate our business in the ordinary course in all material respects prior to completing the Merger unless we obtain the consent of FortisUS, which may restrict our ability to exercise certain of our business strategies. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, incurring indebtedness or making changes to our business prior to the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement prohibits us from (i) soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, knowingly facilitating or encouraging any inquiry or proposal relating to alternative business combination transactions, or (ii) subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding, or providing any nonpublic information in connection with, proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions. The Merger Agreement also requires us to pay FortisUS a\ntermination fee of $245 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if we terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement that provides for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or if our board of directors fails to recommend the Merger Agreement to shareholders. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our shareholders than the value resulting from the Merger. The termination fee may also discourage third parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with respect to us.\nBecause the market value of Fortis common stock that our shareholders will receive in the Merger may fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the stock portion of the consideration that they will receive in the Merger.\nThe stock portion of the merger consideration that our shareholders will receive is a fixed number of shares of Fortis common stock, not a number of shares that will be determined based on a fixed market value. The market value of Fortis common stock, the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and our common stock at the effective time of the Merger may vary significantly from their respective values on the date that the Merger Agreement was executed or at other dates, such as the date on which our shareholders vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement and the effective date of the Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in Fortis\u2019 or ITC Holdings\u2019 respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations, and general business, market, industry or economic conditions. The exchange ratio relating to the stock portion of the Merger Consideration will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market value of Fortis common stock, the comparative value of the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar or our common stock except in very limited circumstances.\nIf the Merger is completed, the combined company may not be able to successfully integrate our business with Fortis and therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nBecause a portion of the merger consideration consists of Fortis common stock, realization of the anticipated benefits in the Merger will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate our business with Fortis. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and support functions. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the Merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results, financial condition or stock price of Fortis (as the combined company following the Merger). The integration process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses. There can be no assurance that the contemplated synergies anticipated from the Merger will be realized.\nAfter the completion of the Merger, sales of Fortis common stock may negatively affect its market price.\nThe shares of Fortis common stock to be issued in the Merger to our shareholders will generally be eligible for immediate resale. The market price of Fortis common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Fortis common stock in the market after the completion of the Merger or the perception in the market that these sales could occur.\nWe may be the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs to us and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.", "PERMNO": 90786, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "ITC1"}
