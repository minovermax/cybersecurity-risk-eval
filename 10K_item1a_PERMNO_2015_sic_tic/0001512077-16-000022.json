RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves substantial risks. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive. You should also read the other information included in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d.\nRisks Related to Our Connectivity Segment\nWe rely on one key customer for a substantial percentage of our Connectivity segment\u2019s revenue.\nOur Connectivity segment is substantially dependent on its customer relationship with Southwest Airlines, which accounted for 85%, 83% and 72% of our Connectivity segment\u2019s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 23% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our existing agreement with Southwest Airlines governs our supply of products and services to Southwest Airlines, including our broadband equipment, Wi-Fi service in connection with the use of our broadband system, live television related services and certain additional contemplated services. In addition, a significant source of our revenue and operating income is generated from our television service with Southwest Airlines. See the risk factor below entitled \u201cWe may be unsuccessful in generating revenue from live television, portal and content-on-demand services.\u201d If we fail to maintain certain minimum service level requirements related to our television service with Southwest Airlines, Southwest Airlines may terminate our agreement to provide them with such service. Similarly, if we fail to meet other obligations related to our technology, equipment or services, Southwest Airlines may have the right to terminate our agreement to provide them with such equipment or services. Our business would be materially adversely affected if Southwest Airlines terminates the television service or our agreement to provide them with equipment and services.\nOur ability to maintain our Connectivity segment\u2019s revenue is largely dependent upon maintaining our existing relationships and agreements with two key customers.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the vast majority of our Connectivity equipment and service revenue was generated by two airlines, Southwest Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle. There is no guarantee that these airlines will continue to maintain the same levels of historical fleet installation growth and services with us. If we are unable to\nmaintain our existing relationships and agreements with Southwest Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face increased demand for greater bandwidth, speed and performance from customers in an increasingly competitive environment featuring new technologies and market entrants, which may require us to significantly invest in improving our Connectivity solution.\nCompetition among providers of connectivity solutions, including satellite providers who can leverage their own gateways and satellite constellations to provide connectivity solutions directly to customers, may impact prices received for services. Moreover, if demand for greater bandwidth, Internet streaming, speed and performance of our network increases, it may force us to expend substantial financial and other resources in investing in future satellite transponder capacity and network infrastructure, and to improve our overall satellite-based and related technologies to ensure that we meet such demands from our current and future customers. The costs of obtaining current and future satellite capacity may also be impacted by limitations in global satellite capacity. Conversely, this also represents an opportunity for us to leverage our existing platform, including our Content services offerings, to further develop and deploy more cost-effective connectivity solutions to meet increased demand for bandwidth and streaming services for our customers. Should increased demand for greater bandwidth, speed and performance from customers continue to increase beyond our current capabilities, coupled with an increasingly competitive environment featuring new technologies and direct satellite providers, we may required to significantly invest in improving our Connectivity solution in the future.\nOur Connectivity industry has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.\nWe completed the first installation of our in-flight connectivity system in 2009 and began generating service revenue in 2010. As of today, we have over 700 planes installed with our Connectivity services. In the United States and rest of the world, we estimate that approximately half and less than 15%, respectively, of our addressable airline market is utilizing some form of satellite based Wi-Fi connectivity services on their planes. While there is a large opportunity in the near and long term to grow our installed-base of planes, our future growth is largely dependent upon airlines, particularly those located outside of the United States, adopting our connectivity services such as ours with limited operating history of doing so. This limited operating history of our Connectivity industry may make it difficult to accurately evaluate our potential growth and future performance, and the growth of our Connectivity segment since inception is not necessarily indicative of potential future growth. Any assessments of our Connectivity segment and predictions that we make about future success or viability may not be accurate. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies growing in rapidly changing industries, and the size and nature of our market opportunity will change as we scale our business and increase deployments of our in-flight connectivity system.\nOur product development costs may increase materially in connection with our efforts to grow our Connectivity segment\u2019s business and remain competitive in the future.\nHistorically, we have incurred significant product development expenses to support the growth of our Connectivity services and offerings. We also expect our Connectivity segment\u2019s costs to fluctuate materially in future periods as we continue to invest resources in further product development efforts, such as our line-fit initiative with Boeing, new antenna development with QEST, expanding our satellite-based services and capabilities, new Airtime IFE product offering and investments in future Ku-HTS technologies and new capital investments in Connectivity equipment, for new and existing customers and services, which could negatively affect our future operating results. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources as we continue to grow our Connectivity segment, and increase our investments in satellite-based technologies and our product offering. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables, including the availability and timing of certain next-generation technologies, such as Ku-HTS and other satellite technologies, timing of our connectivity system becoming line-fit on various Boeing aircraft types and with other major aircraft manufacturers, as well as the need and related costs to develop and implement changes to our software and hardware, the need and related costs to expand our service offerings to be competitive and, with respect to satellite technologies, the need and related costs of obtaining current and future satellite capacity.\nWe face limitations on our ability to grow our domestic Connectivity segment operations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to expand our Connectivity segment domestically at its current rate of growth is inherently limited by various factors, including the limited number of U.S. and foreign commercial airlines operating over our domestic coverage area and who have not already selected a connectivity partner or are otherwise available to sell our products and service, the number of\nplanes operated by our current domestic customer which have not yet been connected and in which our connectivity system can be installed and the passenger capacity within each plane. The growth of our Connectivity segment may slow when compared to more recent results, to the extent that we have exhausted all substantial potential airline customers, and as we approach installation on full fleets and maximum penetration rates on all flights. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to profitably expand the domestic market presence or establish new markets and, if we fail to do so, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in maintaining or growing our revenue from live television, portal and content-on-demand services.\nWe continue to develop and deploy a number of service offerings to deliver to our commercial airline customers.\nLive Television\nWe currently offer up to 20 channels of live television service in the United States, and several channels internationally, and we recently expanded our live television service to our airline customers in Europe and the Middle East, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so or in generating meaningful revenue from that source of content abroad. In the U.S., our customer Southwest Airlines offers free live television on its aircraft, advertised as \u201cTV Flies Free.\u201d The failure of Southwest Airlines to continue to offer TV Flies Free could have a material adverse impact on our Connectivity segment\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to replicate the live television model with other airlines, or the take rate for a passenger fee-based live television model does not meet expected targets, our Connectivity segment\u2019s ability to generate revenue growth in the future could be materially adversely affected.\nPortal Services\nThroughout 2015, we deployed several advertising based portal services, a moving map with flight information and restore Wi-Fi Internet-based texting service onboard Southwest Airlines aircraft. We also intend to further develop and deploy additional Wi-Fi Internet portal services, which we believe will provide our Connectivity segment a substantial revenue opportunity in the near term. We cannot make any assurance that we will be successful in developing and deploying portal services in the future, maintaining current Wi-Fi portal services or that our ability to generate revenue from these services will match our expectations. If our portal services are not successful, our growth and financial prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nContent-on-demand\nSeparate from our content-on-demand offering as part of our live television services, we are also working to increase the number of on-demand movies and other content available on our Wi-Fi Internet connectivity system. The future growth prospects for our business depend, in part, on revenue from advertising fees and e-commerce revenue share arrangements on passenger purchases of goods and services, including video and media services. Our ability to generate revenue from these service offerings depends on the:\n\u2022\ngrowth of our Connectivity segment\u2019s commercial airline customer base;\n\u2022\nattractiveness of our Connectivity segment\u2019s customer base to media partners;\n\u2022\ndeployment of live television and content-on-demand on more aircraft and with additional airline customers and increasing passenger adoption both in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022\nestablishment and maintenance of beneficial contractual relationships with media partners whose content, products and services are attractive to airline passengers; and,\n\u2022\nability to customize and improve our Connectivity segment\u2019s service offerings in response to trends and customer interests.\nIf we are unsuccessful in generating revenue from our Connectivity segment\u2019s service offerings, that failure could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe plan to make increased investments in equipment for our customers in the future\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $2.7 million in equipment leases. In 2016, we plan to increase our investments in customer equipment to continue to grow our connectivity segment. Equipment investments typically involve upfront financial incentives on the pricing of our connectivity equipment, including certain installation costs, in exchange for a higher portion of future customers\u2019 connectivity service revenue. Should our share of such future service revenue not be sufficient to cover or exceed our upfront equipment investments, we may incur significant costs that may not be immediately recoverable or recoverable at all.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our Connectivity segment internationally, which could harm the growth of our business, operating results and financial conditions.\nOur ability to expand our Connectivity segment internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets and the possibility that there may not be returns on these investments in the near future, comparable to our recent financial results or at all. Throughout 2014 and 2015, we began international connectivity trials with Air China and Air France, and more recently began deploying our Airconnect system in the Middle East, with flydubai and in India, with Jet Airways. There is no assurance that these will result in a long-term profitable relationship with these customers. Additionally, and in connection with our agreement to equip flydubai\u2019s aircraft with our Airconnect system, we are making investments in our Airconnect installations and equipment with improved economics for us on future connectivity services over the term of the agreement. As a result, we will incur significant upfront investments in 2016 that may not be immediately recoverable or recoverable at all if our future services do not perform to our forecasted expectations. Our Connectivity segment\u2019s ability to expand will also be limited by the demand for in-flight broadband Internet access in key international markets. Different privacy, censorship, aerospace and liability standards and regulations, governmental instability and political change and different intellectual property laws and enforcement practices in foreign countries may cause our business and operating results to suffer. Additionally, any failure to compete successfully in international markets could negatively impact our reputation and domestic operations.\nAny future international operations, including our planned expansion into China and continued expansion into other emerging markets, may be unsuccessful due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent technological solutions for broadband Internet than those used in North America;\n\u2022\nvaried, unfamiliar and unclear legal and regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in governmental or political structures in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlegal, political or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers or the establishment of economic sanctions by the U.S. affecting businesses such as ours;\n\u2022\ninability to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act compliance and related risks;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nongoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022\nlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to grow our Connectivity segment internationally or may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our future operating results and financial condition.\nWe are currently engaged in trials of our Connectivity solution on two aircraft operated by Air China and two aircraft operated by Air France in connection with each airline\u2019s choice of a connectivity provider. Failure to win Air China or Air France as a client could have an adverse impact on our plans to expand our services into China and throughout Europe.\nWe are currently under trial to install our Connectivity solution on aircrafts operated by Air China and Air France. The Air China trial commenced aboard a 777-200 aircraft in the second half of 2014, and will enable Air China\u2019s passengers to access the Internet and stored content on approved handheld devices, in accordance with applicable Chinese regulations. Further, in early 2016 we received an additional trial order from Air China for one of its 737NG aircraft. In addition, we also commenced a connectivity trial in partnership with telecommunications provider Orange on board two Air France aircraft in early 2016. An expansion of our business into China will require us to comply with a number of foreign laws, rules and regulations with which we have limited prior experience. Our management team\u2019s lack of experience with these new requirements could increase the likelihood that we will inadvertently violate such a requirement, which could divert more of our resources and negatively impact our business. We cannot assure you that the trials with either Air China or Air France will be successful, which could mean that the costs incurred and resources expended in connection with these trials may not yield the expansion of our business that we have anticipated. Even if the trials with Air China and Air France are successful, we may not realize the benefits of the trial if we are unable to expand our business in China and Europe beyond the test aircraft. We cannot assure you that this expansion will generate additional revenues or increase our profitability. Even if this expansion generates the benefits that we have anticipated, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that occur as a result of the expansion, which could adversely impact our profitability and our business.\nWe rely on single service providers for certain critical components of, and services relating to, our satellite connectivity network.\nWe currently source key components of our hardware and key aspects of our connectivity services from sole providers of equipment and network services, respectively, including the satellite antenna sourced from TECOM Industries, Inc., or TECOM, and substantially all of our Connectivity segment\u2019s satellite modems from Hughes Network Systems, LLC, or HNS. In addition, we announced in 2015 a new hardware satellite product development project with QEST, and a new satellite agreement with SES. While we have contracts in effect with these key component and service providers, if we experience a disruption in the delivery of products and services from any of these providers, it may be difficult for us to continue providing our own products and services to our customers. We have experienced component delivery issues in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid similar issues in the future. Additionally, any loss of favored nation relationships that we have with our hardware providers today could eliminate our competitive advantage in the use of satellites for in-flight connectivity in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying new global antenna technologies.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a long-term development project with QEST to develop new global antenna technologies, which is expected to be available in the second half of 2016. In connection therewith, we have made and continue to make significant product development investments to our existing connectivity technology solutions to address these new technologies. Since our new global antenna technologies are currently in the development stage and have yet to be deployed for commercial use, there can be no assurance that such technologies will perform as expected or be commercially available on our current timeline, if at all, due to, among other things, the failure of the technologies to perform as expected, problems arising in the development process, and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals to deploy and operate such technologies. If the technologies fail to perform as expected or their commercial availability is significantly delayed, our business, business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third parties to manufacture our Connectivity segment\u2019s equipment components and to provide services for our network.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components that we use to provide our connectivity services. The supply of third party components could be interrupted or halted by a termination of these relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our Connectivity segment, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur new Operations Solutions business may present new challenges to our business and subject us to additional risks.\nThe acquisitions of masFlight and navAero form the foundation of our new Operations Solutions business line. While masFlight and navAero have historically been leaders in operational data analytics and cockpit data solutions, we may encounter additional challenges we have not previously faced that are particular to the provision of business intelligence, data analytics and real-time operational management, including:\n\u2022\nContinued availability and reliability of data sources utilized in our platform, including radar, aircraft, flight and schedule information provided by government agencies, commercial publishers, global distribution systems, and individual airlines;\n\u2022\nContinued availability and reliability of third-party cloud services and data hosting companies, including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Services. Substantially all of masFlight\u2019s customer-facing solutions are operated from the Amazon Web Services environment. An extended disruption in the availability of Amazon Web Services resources may impact our ability to deliver contracted services to our customers;\n\u2022\nNew competition related to data aggregation, cloud data warehousing, benchmarking, analytics, business intelligence, flight operations management, schedule planning, cockpit EFB software and aircraft interface devices;\n\u2022\nReliance on commercial partners and third parties for the transmission of aircraft-generated data to ground-based information systems and computer networks;\n\u2022\nChanges to government regulations related to the segregation and security of sensitive air-traffic management data, real-time and historical aircraft position information including VIP movements, avionics data and other aircraft information generated during flight, and other safety-sensitive data sources.\nWe may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, and expend a significant amount of management\u2019s time and resources in incorporating and managing this new business line.\nOur entry into new business lines may not be successful.\nWe recently commenced new business lines related to business aviation and advertising. While we plan to leverage our offerings and expertise in the commercial airline industry and utilize partners in the business aviation industry to provide solutions for business jet passengers and pilots, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully penetrate the business aviation market or that such endeavor will be profitable. Similarly, no assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts to grow our advertising business. If our entry into one or both of these new business lines is not successful, we may not be able to recover the resources we expend on these endeavors and it could have an adverse effect on how our other products and services are perceived.\nRisks Related to Our Content Segment\nThe portion of our Content segment that is based on applications as part of in-flight entertainment has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.\nWe have developed applications to be used on more sophisticated in-flight entertainment hardware platforms as well as a wireless streaming solution to be used on planes without in-flight entertainment hardware. Our applications and wireless streaming solution are still in development phases and have limited operating histories. This makes it difficult for us to accurately evaluate the potential growth and future performance of the applications and wireless solution. Any assessments of our applications and wireless solution and predictions that we make about future success or viability may not be accurate. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies expanding in new product development areas in rapidly changing industries, and the size and nature of our market opportunity will change as we scale our applications and wireless streaming solution.\nWe may not accurately predict the profit margins of our Content segment with respect to its long-term fixed price contracts.\nIn some cases our Content segment has entered into multi-year, fixed-price delivery contracts with certain studios. These procurement contracts enable us to purchase content from certain studios during the respective terms of the contracts at a fixed purchase price, or through \u201cflat deals\u201d. Adjustments of the previously agreed upon purchase price might be necessary in certain circumstances if there are significant changes the customer demand or content supply during the term of a given contract. If we\nare unable to make such adjustments accordingly, or if there is a shift in the customer base under such contracts, then there is a risk that the profit margins on our flat fee agreements may be smaller than predicted or even a loss, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Content segment is subject to ongoing tax audits that could result in additional tax payments or a reduction in tax loss carryforwards.\nA comprehensive tax audit by the Canadian tax authorities of our Canadian subsidiary DTI Software for the tax years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 is ongoing. More specifically, the Canadian tax authorities are currently investigating DTI\u2019s tax status in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and whether income derived in Dubai should have been constituted taxable earnings subject to Canadian income tax for the tax years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. We estimate the maximum Canadian income tax exposure for the taxable years 2008 through 2011 is approximately $3.6 million, including potential interest and penalties. We are currently investigating these claims and are not able to estimate the aggregate potential tax liability that could result for subsequent tax years after 2011. If the Canadian tax authorities attempt to assess similar penalties for tax years subsequent to 2011, we may be subject to significant historical tax obligations, including penalties and accrued interest. In addition, DTI claims certain tax credits in the course of the development of games and applications in Canada including tax credits that support multimedia, e-commerce and research and development in Canada. It is possible that Canadian tax authorities might come to a different conclusion concerning the respective amounts that DTI is able to claim. This could lead to an adjustment of the booked tax credits that could be material to our financial condition.\nOur Content segment currently make claims for investment tax credits that are available in Canada to support multimedia, e-commerce and research and development in Canada, and any reduction in or elimination of government support for such tax credits would negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nDTI Software makes claims for currently available tax credits in Canada in the course of its development of games and applications in Canada, including tax credits that support multimedia, e-commerce and research and development in Canada. If governmental authorities in Canada, and, in particular, in the province of Quebec, were to reduce or eliminate the amount of tax credits that are available in respect of these activities by DTI, then our tax liabilities would likely increase, and our overall profitability would be negatively impacted.\nOn-board use of personal electronic devices may harm our Content segment.\nEver-increasing numbers of passengers have their own personal electronic devices which they might use to bring their own content such as movies, music or games with them on a flight or to access on-board connectivity to the Internet, live television or content on demand. This could decrease demand for our Content segment\u2019s in-flight offerings provided through seatback screens or other fixed on-board screens, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nMany of our Content segment\u2019s products have long sales cycles, which may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and which makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our revenue. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our Content segment\u2019s products have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps, including initial customer contacts, specification writing, software engineering design, software prototyping, pilot testing, device certification, regulatory approvals (if needed), sales and marketing and commercial manufacture, integration and delivery. During this time, we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance that product sales will result. The anticipated long sales cycle for some of our Content segment\u2019s products makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur. Delays in sales may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and make it difficult to plan expenses and forecast revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Content segment may not retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products, or if our new or enhanced products do not gain market acceptance.\nThe in-flight entertainment market is faced with rapid technological change, evolving standards in computer hardware, software development, communications and security infrastructure, and changing needs and expectations of customers. Building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development. A substantial portion of our Content segment\u2019s research and development resources are devoted to maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support. These demands put significant constraints on the resources that we have available for new\nproduct development. We also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products for our Content segment, because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks, and our lack of a formal hedging strategy could create losses.\nWithin our Content segment, currency risks arise from the fact that both sales to customers and purchasing are largely transacted in U.S. dollars, while most of our Content segment\u2019s operating companies\u2019 fixed costs are incurred in local currencies such as euros, British pounds, Indian rupees and Canadian dollars. Historically, we have engaged from time to time in hedging transactions to counteract direct currency risks. However, we do not have a formal hedging strategy, and cannot guarantee that all currency risks have been or will be hedged in full. Severe currency fluctuations could also cause the hedging transactions to fail if agreed thresholds (triggers) are not met or exceeded. We therefore cannot preclude negative foreign currency effects in the future\u2212some of which may be substantial\u2212due to unforeseen exchange rate fluctuations and/or inaccurate assessments of market developments.\nThere are also intragroup receivables and liabilities in our Content segment, such as loans, that can generate significant foreign currency effects. Changes in the exchange rates of a number of foreign currencies against the euro, especially the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, could lead to the recognition of unrealized foreign exchange losses in some cases, particularly as a result of intragroup transactions. Therefore, our Content segment is exposed to a heightened currency risk in connection with intragroup borrowing owing to the foreign currency sensitivity exchange rate movements that are difficult to predict.\nOur Content segment faces intense pricing pressure.\nDue to our scale and market position, we have historically been able to offer competitive pricing compared to our competitors. However, pricing pressures from both our customers and studios continue to be high. We cannot assure you that we can maintain our historical pricing efficiencies, and we may need to provide price concessions in order to acquire new customers or retain current customers. This may have a negative adverse effect on our revenue, profit, financial trends and results of operations.\nWe source our content from studios, distributors and other content providers, and any reduction in the volume or quality of content produced by such content providers could hurt our Content segment by providing it with less quality content to choose from and resulting in potentially less attractive offerings for passengers.\nWe receive content from studios, distributors and other content providers, and, in some circumstances, we depend on the volume and quality of the content that these content providers produce. If studios, distributors or other content providers were to reduce the volume or quality of content that they make available to us over any given time period, whether because of their own financial limitations or other factors influencing their businesses, we would have less quality content to choose from, and our programmers would have more difficulty finding relevant and appropriate content to provide to our customers. This could negatively impact the passenger experience, which could, in turn, reduce the demand for our Content segment\u2019s offerings, which would have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction or elimination of the time between our receipt of content and the content being made more broadly publicly available to the rental or home viewing market.\nWe receive the content that we provide through our Content segment directly from studios, distributors and other content providers, and the timing is at the discretion of the content providers. Historically, we received content prior to such content being more broadly publicly distributed via rental viewing, retail stores or Internet streaming services. If a content provider delays release of certain content in a manner reducing or eliminating this \u201cearly window,\u201d our Content segment may not be able to generate as much revenue from such content as we could have generated with an earlier release date.\nThe revenue generated by our Content segment may be adversely affected by a reduction or elimination of use of our Content segment\u2019s services by competitors in the marketplace.\nA portion of our Content segment\u2019s income is currently generated by the licensing of software and content and by the performance of content processing services for direct competitors, including other content service providers. If our competitors develop their own software and content acquisition and processing capabilities, our Content segment may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Technology, Intellectual Property and Government Regulation\nOur Connectivity segment may suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures or damage to its equipment.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our commercial airline customers depends, in part, upon the reliable performance of our Connectivity segment\u2019s satellite transponder capacity, network infrastructure and connectivity system. The operations and services of our Connectivity segment depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage from fire, flood, earthquakes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. Damage to our networks could cause interruptions in the services that we provide through our Connectivity segment, which could have a material adverse effect on our service revenue, our reputation and our ability to attract or retain customers. Our Connectivity segment has experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including component and service failures that temporarily disrupted users\u2019 access to the Internet, and we may experience further service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures, which may be due to factors beyond our control. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation could be harmed and our airline customers may have the right to terminate their contracts with us or pursue other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Certain of our suppliers do not provide indemnity to us for the use of the products and services that these providers supply to us. At the same time, we generally offer third party intellectual property infringement indemnity to the customers of our Connectivity segment which, in some cases, do not cap our indemnity obligations and thus could render us liable for both defense costs and any judgments. Any of these events could result in increases in our operating expenses, limit our service offerings or result in a loss of business if we are unable to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline customers terminate or fail to renew their contracts.\nWe are subject to civil litigation involving allegations of copyright infringement and related claims for indemnification, which could result in our having to pay damages or injunctive relief. We may also be subject to additional similar litigation in the future.\nAs discussed in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we have been and currently are subject to civil litigation by parties claiming that certain of our audio and music programming offerings infringe the copyright and other intellectual property rights of such parties. On May 6, 2014, UMG Recordings, Inc., Capital Records, Universal Music Corp and entities affiliated with the foregoing (collectively, \u201cUMG\u201d) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company and Inflight Productions Ltd. (\u201cIFP\u201d) for copyright infringement and related claims and unspecified money damages. IFP is a direct subsidiary of Global Entertainment AG, or GE AG, and an indirect subsidiary of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the potential range of loss related to this matter cannot be determined. The case continues in the U.S. District Court and the parties have engaged in various settlement discussions. On July 1, 2014, American Airlines, Inc. (\u201cAmerican\u201d) filed suit in Texas State Court, Tarrant County, against IFP, and filed an amended complaint on October 29, 2014, seeking a declaration that IFP is obligated to defend and indemnify American against claims that UMG may assert against American for copyright infringement insofar as such claims arise out of American\u2019s use of content provided by IFP during a limited period of time, and for breach of contract. The American lawsuit seeks unspecified money damages and liquidated damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees. The Company and American are in discussions regarding a settlement. The outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. We may in the future be subject to additional similar civil litigation involving copyright infringement, which could result in injunctive relief or our having to pay damages or claims for indemnification. We have incurred costs to defend and settle such lawsuits, and may incur additional costs in the future, and such costs may be material. We may also be subject to injunctive relief and our having to pay damages.\nThe use of open source software in our Connectivity segment could limit our ability to commercialize our technology.\nOpen source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the applicable open source license. Accordingly, and depending on the manner in which such licenses are interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of the products of our Connectivity segment and could be required to (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including to competitors; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe failure of our Connectivity segment\u2019s equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages and impairing our ability to sell our connectivity service.\nOur Connectivity segment\u2019s products contain complex systems and components that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology. If any of our connectivity products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such events could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. If our Connectivity segment\u2019s on-board equipment has a severe malfunction, or there is a problem with the equipment installation, which damages an airplane or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial product liability claims or costly repair obligations. In particular, passenger jets operated by our airline customers are very costly to repair; therefore, the damages in any product liability claims could be material. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify most of our airline customers for losses due to third-party claims and, in certain cases, the causes for such losses may include failure of our products.\nThe software underlying our connectivity services is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when the software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects or errors in its software, and defects or errors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any defects or errors, particularly those that cause interruptions to the availability of our connectivity services could result in:\n\u2022\ntermination or failure to renew contracts by our airline customers;\n\u2022\na reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our connectivity service;\n\u2022\nsales credits or refunds to our customers;\n\u2022\ngovernmental compliance requirements regarding customer privacy rights;\n\u2022\nloss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation and brand image;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs; and\n\u2022\nclaims for substantial damages.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nRegulation by United States government agencies, such as the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, and the FCC, which regulates the U.S. telecommunications industry, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to various governmental regulations, including those regulations promulgated by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies and comparable agencies outside the United States where we do, or in the future may do, business. The U.S. government agency that has primary regulatory authority over our\noperations is the Federal Aviation Agency, or the FAA. The commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated by the FAA in the United States. FAA certification is required for all equipment that we install on commercial aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification as a parts manufacturer. FAA approvals required to operate our Connectivity segment include Supplemental Type Certificates, or STCs, and Parts Manufacturing Authority, or PMAs. Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. The FAA closely regulates many of our operations. If we fail to comply with the FAA\u2019s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations or other approvals on which the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA may adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations, such as recently promulgated regulations with respect to random bird strike testing. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nIn addition to the FAA, we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). As part of our authorization to commence providing satellite-based Wi-Fi connectivity services to aircraft, we obtained a license from the FCC that obligates us to comply with various requirements specifically identified in that license and with the general rules and regulations promulgated by the FCC. In addition, we agreed to cooperate with law enforcement agencies of the U.S. government to address specific concerns regarding providing connectivity to aircraft over the United States. Also, as a broadband Internet provider, we must also comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, or CALEA, and similar laws in other countries, which require communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solutions are deployed in our U.S. network and Western European network, but we nevertheless could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC, other telecommunications regulators or law enforcement agencies for any delays related to meeting any current or future CALEA or similarly mandated law enforcement related obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders or other penalties, all of which could adversely affect our business. Further, to the extent that the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs that we must incur to comply with such regulations.\nAdverse decisions or regulations of these regulatory bodies could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business.\nRegulation by foreign government agencies may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services.\nOur Connectivity segment is subject to regulations promulgated by various regulatory agencies and legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions where we do, or in the future may do, business. These foreign bodies may require us to obtain certifications for equipment that we install on commercial aircraft, and certain of our operating activities may require that we obtain foreign regulatory certifications as a parts manufacturer. Obtaining these certifications could be an expensive and time-consuming process requiring significant focus and resources. Adverse decisions or regulations of these foreign government agencies could delay the roll-out of our services and have other adverse consequences for us. For example, our agreement to equip flydubai with our Airconnect system, as well as the installation of our Connectivity solution on aircraft operated by Air China and Air France, are subject to regulatory approval processes currently underway, which processes could delay or ultimately prohibit these agreements from being performed under their current terms or at all.\nAny inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet the installation commitments of our Connectivity segment, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business and could, therefore, materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. Many of our operations are subject to regulation by a number of foreign regulatory agencies in multiple foreign jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with the many foreign regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the foreign certifications, authorizations or other approvals on which the manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities of our Connectivity segment are based. In addition, from time to time, the foreign bodies that regulate our activities may adopt new regulations, amend existing regulations or change their policies, all of which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or\npolicies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations would generally increase our costs of compliance.\nIf government regulation of the Internet, including e-commerce or online video distribution, changes, we may need to change the way we operate our Connectivity segment to a manner that incurs greater operating expenses, which could harm our results of operations.\nThe current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. Certain laws and regulations applicable to our Connectivity segment were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and often do not contemplate or address specific issues associated with those technologies. We cannot be certain that we, our vendors and media partners or our customers are currently in compliance with all applicable regulatory or other legal requirements in all of the countries in which our connectivity service is used. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business, to comply with existing or future legal or regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. For example, the FCC adopted regulations regarding net neutrality that, in certain situations, limit mobile broadband providers to \u201cnetwork management\u201d techniques that are reasonable; however, the rules were struck down by the D.C. Circuit Court as outside the scope of the FCC\u2019s regulatory authority. Although these rules are no longer in effect, the FCC has indicated it intends to implement similar network management limitations in the future, which, if deemed valid under the FCC\u2019s authority, could adversely impact our ability to monitor and manage the network to optimize our users\u2019 Internet experience.\nWe cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions that Connectivity segment has taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to our connectivity system, which could be costly and difficult. Any of these events would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls are ineffective due to a material weaknesses in our internal control over the timeliness of financial reporting. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over timely financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2015 audit, our management conducted an assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the existence of a material weakness in our internal controls surrounding the timeliness of our 2015 financial statement close process, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were ineffective. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nWe may need to expend significant financial resources to remediate this material weakness. If we are unable to establish and maintain proper and effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which itself is affected by many events that are beyond the control of the airlines. The highly competitive nature of the airline industry makes it extremely sensitive to economic conditions, both domestically and internationally.\nOur business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial airlines, the financial condition of these airlines and related economic conditions and the general availability of air travel around the world. If consumer demand for air travel declines, or the number of aircraft and flights shrink, or air travel is severely disrupted in a key operating area, the number of passengers available to use our in-flight services and enjoy our delivered content will be reduced, which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. High unemployment rates, reduced consumer and business\nspending, recessionary conditions in the United States or Europe and terrorism are among the general economic and social conditions that adversely affect the airline industry. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending can result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in the number of airline flights offered, the number of passengers flying and the willingness of airlines to commit to spending funds on items such as our in-flight connectivity system. Each of our airline customers operates in an intensely competitive environment and constantly faces pressure on in-flight offerings and pricing of all aspects of air travel. These uncertain and, at times, unfavorable financial circumstances in the air travel industry could cause one or more of our commercial airline customers to reduce expenditures on passenger services, including the deployment of our in-flight connectivity system or content, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial condition.\nUncertain global economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInstability and changes in economic and political conditions across the globe, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts are among the global risks that may impact our business and our plans for expansion. Our operations and performance are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally.\nFor example, the United States and the European Union recently expanded their sanctions against Russia which, among other things, increased the restrictions on sales of certain products, including aviation products and planes, to Russia and to specified restricted parties in or affiliated with Russia. Such sanctions have negatively affect the business that our two customers in Russia conduct with us and, in such case, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, the realizability of our accounts receivables with such parties, and the results of our operations. In addition, geopolitical instability in the Middle East as well as the continued volatility of the currency markets in the emerging economies could negatively impact the broader economy, which could affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf the benefits of any acquisition that we or any of our subsidiaries consummate do not meet the expectations of the marketplace, investors, financial analysts or industry analysts, our financial condition may be negatively affected and the market price of our securities may decline.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisitions as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by, the marketplace, investors, financial analysts or industry analysts. Any such failure may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nSubsequent to the consummation of any acquisition that we may consummate, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that may have a negative effect on our financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence in connection with the acquisitions WOI, RMG, masFlight and navAero, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in WOI, RMG, masFlight and navAero\u2019s respective businesses, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. Similarly, subsequent to the consummation of any future acquisition, regardless of any due diligence we may conduct, certain issues or risks may be revealed. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence that we conducted in connection with acquisitions that we have already consummated or that we consummate in the future successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. Any such write-downs, write-offs, restructuring or charges could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nAdditional businesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition to the acquisitions that we consummated in 2013, we may engage in further acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our growth. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Moreover, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of\nexpected return-on-investment targets or may fail. In addition to the risks described above, any past or future acquisition could involve numerous additional risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nuse of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited market experience in new businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies that we acquire;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\ncontrols in the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\ndilution to our current stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event that we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review, or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions.\nIn certain of our previously completed acquisitions, we have agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts, based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. We may use earnouts for acquisitions in the future. The performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified benchmarks during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business, grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt. The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations, our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.\nThe failure to implement, as well as the completion and impact of, our restructuring efforts could adversely affect our business.\nIn September 2014, we announced our formal restructuring plan to streamline/improve operating procedures and generate synergies within our business. These corporate realignment activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, including complex legal- and tax-related matters. We incurred approximately $0.4 million and $4.2 million in restructuring charges in connection with these efforts in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We may incur costs and expend considerable resources in connection with this and/or any additional restructuring plans and these activities could distract our management and negatively impact our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement this restructuring, which could mean that the costs incurred and resources expended in connection with our restructuring efforts may not yield the results that we anticipate. Even if we do successfully implement our restructuring, we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from these efforts. We cannot assure you that the restructuring will result in cost savings or will materially\nincrease our profitability. Even if the restructuring generates the benefits that we have anticipated, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that occur as a result of the reorganization, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nA future act or threat of terrorism or other events could result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft.\nA future act of terrorism, the threat of such acts or other airline accidents could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In the event of a terrorist attack, terrorist threats or unrelated airline accidents, the industry would likely experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft, which would eliminate demand for our in-flight equipment and services. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or services and accidents involving aircraft on which our equipment or services operate would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our services. Reduced demand for our products and services would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow our business with our current airline customers or successfully secure new airline customers in the future, on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are constantly in negotiations and discussions with existing airline customers and potential new airline customers to either maintain or expand an existing contract or win a new contract. Negotiations with airline customers require a substantial amount of time, energy and resources, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining existing customers or winning new customers. If any of our current airline customers or potential new airline customers do not view our product and service offerings as high-quality or cost-effective, or if we do not keep pace with innovation, our current and potential customers may choose to do business with our competitors. Unreliable service levels, uncompetitive pricing, lack of availability, security risk and lack of related features of our equipment and services are some of the factors that may adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers and partners and attract new and repeat customers. If consumers are able to satisfy their in-flight entertainment needs through activities other than broadband Internet access, at no or lower cost, they may not perceive value in our products and services.\nAdditionally, the terms of any future agreements with existing or new airline customers may be less favorable than the current agreements. We may ultimately fail in entering into agreements with additional commercial airlines on competitive terms, and that failure could harm our results of operations due to a diversion of resources, the actual costs of pursuing these opportunities and the inability to deploy committed satellite transponder space segments to additional airlines. To the extent that we are unable to secure new airline customers or that any of our future agreements with existing or new customers are not as favorable as our existing arrangements, our growth and financial prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased costs and other demands associated with the growth of our business could impact our ability to achieve profitability over the long term and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources.\nAnticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our service offerings and international expansion of our business into new markets, could require the outlay of significant operating and capital expenditures and could place strains on our personnel, technology and infrastructure. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to contain costs with respect to growth opportunities. To successfully manage the expected growth of our operations in a timely and cost-effective manner, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees and must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to successfully manage the growth of our business, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from a number of companies could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and a loss of market share, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nIn-flight entertainment is undergoing a sea change driven, first and foremost, by technical innovations. We face competition from land-based providers of broadband Wi-Fi services to commercial airlines and from other satellite-based broadband providers of Internet connectivity, live television, video on-demand services and content. In recent years, a number of new vendors have emerged with new technologies and new approaches, especially for the hardware systems that are built into aircraft. Competition from such providers has affected the prospects of our business and will continue to do so in the future, especially given the fact that there are a limited number of commercial airlines around the world. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified companies with greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, these competitors may be better positioned to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns,\nespecially those that continue for extended periods of time. Competition within the in-flight broadband Internet access and in-cabin entertainment markets may also subject us to downward pricing pressures on our service and product offerings. Competition will likely increase our sales and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the liquidity, financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. Our failure to respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute the growth strategy of our business. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries is intense. We believe that the future success of our business depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our satellite based broadband connectivity network and our Content segment. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. In particular, we may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. In addition, because of the widespread geographical locations of our business, we have a risk of migration of employees and poor retention rate. We may also encounter challenges in complying with foreign employment laws and regulations in our many international locations. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees or any failure to comply with applicable foreign employment laws and regulations could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the continued service and performance of key personnel. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our segments and their operations. As a result, if any of these individuals were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, as well as certain of our key marketing or technology personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nOur corporate structure may create tax inefficiencies.\nGE AG is our wholly-owned subsidiary and thus a controlled foreign corporation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This organizational structure may create inefficiencies, as certain types of income and investments of GE AG that otherwise would not be currently taxable under general tax principles, may become taxable. In addition, distributions from the operating subsidiaries of GE AG may be subject to additional withholding tax and result in lower profits. We are in the process of implementing changes to streamline our corporate structure. By doing so, certain transactions in the restructuring could be taxable in the United States and Germany. We cannot presently predict the impact such restructuring may have on U.S. and foreign tax liability.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above.\nIn addition to our convertible notes, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, subject to restrictions contained in our existing and future debt instruments, some or all of which may be secured debt. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due. Our Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2014, with Citibank, N.A., or our Credit Agreement, restricts our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes at maturity, to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase our convertible notes upon a fundamental change or on specified repurchase dates, and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase our convertible notes.\nAt maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of our convertible notes will become due and payable by us. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or upon each of February 20, 2022, February 22, 2025 and February 22, 2030, holders of convertible notes will also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of our convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of our convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of our convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, make repurchases of our convertible notes or settle conversions of our convertible notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase our convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory action or agreements governing our indebtedness. Furthermore, certain transactions or events that would give holders of our convertible notes, if issued, the right to put our convertible notes back to us or to convert our convertible notes with an increased conversion rate would constitute events of default under the Credit Agreement. Our failure to repay the principal amount of our convertible notes, repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to settle conversions of our convertible notes would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversion thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes is triggered, holders of convertible notes will be entitled to convert our convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which may result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible notes because they may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 deficit on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of our convertible notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of our convertible notes to their face amount over the term of our convertible notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our convertible notes.\nIn addition, because our convertible notes may be settled entirely or partly in cash, under certain circumstances, our convertible notes are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of our convertible notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted\nearnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our total outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 was $72.2 million, net of fees. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2015, we had $20.0 million of availability for additional borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The indenture governing our convertible notes does not limit our ability to incur indebtedness, and we could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond such amount. Our substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nobligating us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nWe intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds from external sources. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, properties, assets or condition or a failure to pay any amount due, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments.\nIf we do not comply with the provisions of our Credit Agreement, our lenders may terminate their obligations to us and require us to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder.\nOur Credit Agreement contains provisions that limit our operating and financing activities, including financial covenants relating to liquidity, indebtedness and Adjusted EBITDA. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may among other things, terminate their obligations thereunder and require us to repay all amounts thereunder. Depending on the amount of indebtedness we have drawn under our Credit Agreement, any such repayment obligation could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the indenture governing our convertible notes may increase the price of or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe indenture governing our convertible notes requires us to repurchase our convertible notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of us and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase our convertible notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a combinatory transaction with us. Such additional costs may have the effect of preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nConversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of our convertible notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock\nissuable upon such conversion or any anticipated conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of our convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe interests of our largest stockholder may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2016, PAR Investment Partners, L.P., or PAR, beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, PAR may have the ability to influence the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions of the Company requiring stockholder approval, including amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of PAR may conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of shares of our common stock. We have registered for resale shares of our common stock held by stockholders owning a significant portion of our total outstanding shares, including the shares held by PAR which constitute approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock. We also have outstanding approximately 2,780,744 stock options that are currently exercisable by the holders thereof. Our significant stockholders, including PAR, have the ability to sell large amounts of our stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our stock price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our stock or make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may decline as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on an investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price that you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company, the market for in-flight entertainment, the airline industry, or the travel market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. As a result, the trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWarrants currently exercisable for our common stock could significantly increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOutstanding warrants purchasing an aggregate of 6,173,228 shares of our common stock are exercisable for a like number of shares of our common stock. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per share. To the extent that such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of common stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $17.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time that we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. A registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants was declared effective by the SEC on August 22, 2013. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nWe may amend the terms of our outstanding warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of such warrants then outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 6.2 million warrants outstanding that were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between American Transfer & Stock Company, LLC, as warrant agent. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants is unlimited, examples of such\namendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about the Company, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If insufficient securities or industry analysts cover us, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts covering us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders and to cancel previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future, which may result in additional dilution to investors.\nIn February 2015, we issued $82.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes and during the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 1.4 million shares of common stock in exchange for 4.2 million outstanding warrants, as well as additional shares of common stock pursuant to awards made under our equity incentive plan. As a result of the issuance of common stock, there was dilution to our then existing shareholders. To the extent that any of the convertible notes are converted into shares of common stock or we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock, our then existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock offered. In addition, to the extent we settle the conversion of the convertible notes with shares of our common stock, such conversion would be dilutive to our current stockholders. The conversion of a significant amount of our convertible notes, if settled in shares, could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, which could adversely affect your ability to sell your shares in the market or our ability to raise capital in the future or both.\nLack of dividends may make our stock less attractive as an investment.\nWe intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our stockholders may have to sell some or all of their common stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Our stockholders may not receive a gain on their investment when they sell their common stock and may lose some or the entire amount of their investment. In addition, stocks that pay regular dividends command higher market trading prices, and so our stock price may be lower as a result of our dividend policy. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12792, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GEENQ"}
