{"cik": "1665300", "company": "Phunware, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nOur revenue has declined, we have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our inception. We experienced a consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. These losses were due to both a reduction in revenue in 2017 and 2018, as compared to previous years, and the substantial investments we made to build our products and services, grow and maintain our business and acquire customers. You should not consider our historical revenue levels or operating expenses prior to recent periods as indicative of our future performance. Key elements of our growth strategy include acquiring new customers and continuing to innovate and build our brand. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future due to expected increased sales and marketing expenses, operations costs, research and development costs and general and administrative costs and, therefore, our operating losses will continue or even potentially increase for the foreseeable future. In addition, as a public company we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Furthermore, to the extent that we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also incur increased expenses because costs associated with generating and supporting customer agreements are generally incurred up front, while revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed term of the agreement. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for many reasons, including the other risks described in this report and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. You should not rely upon our recent bookings or revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. We cannot assure you that we will reach profitability in the future or at any specific time in the future or that, if and when we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, investors could lose their investment.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our technology offerings and services in response to ongoing market changes.\nThe collaboration and technology solutions business and markets are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions. Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement technology offerings and services that anticipate or timely respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new technology providers to serve the evolving needs of our customers. Examples of areas of significant change in the industry include cloud, software defined infrastructure, virtualization, security, mobility, data analytics and IoT, the continued shift from maintenance to managed services and ultimately to cloud based services, as-a-service solutions, security and information technology automation. In addition, enterprises are continuing to shift from on-premise, hardware infrastructure to software centric hosted solutions. Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology and services by our customers and could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated. These technologies and others that may emerge, could reduce and, over time, replace some of our current business. In addition, customers may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology, industry developments and our personnel, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our technology offerings and services, our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to continue to grow could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware, software and services offerings, for example, by providing the appropriate training to out account managers, sales technology specialists, engineers and consultants to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to expand or renew sales to existing customers, or attract new customers, our growth could be slower than expected and our business may be harmed.\nOur future growth depends upon expanding sales and renewals of our technology offerings and services with existing customers. Our customers may not purchase our technology offerings and services, or our customers may reduce their purchase rate of services, if we do not demonstrate the value proposition for their investment and we may not be able to replace existing customers with new customers. In addition, our customers may not renew their contracts with us on the same terms, or at all, because of dissatisfaction with our service. If our customers do not renew their contracts, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline.\nAdditionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. We plan to continue expanding our sales efforts but we may be unable to hire qualified sales personnel, may be unable to successfully train those sales personnel that we are able to hire and sales personnel may not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected, or at all. Additionally, although we dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, these sales and marketing programs may not have the desired effect and may not expand sales. We cannot assure you that its efforts will increase sales to existing customers or additional revenue. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our future growth may be limited.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will also depend upon our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate competing technology offerings and services into our business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new technology offerings and services. If we fail to attract new customers and maintain and expand those customer relationships, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected and our business may be harmed.\nDemand for our technology offerings and services could be adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our technology offerings and services, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions affect our customers\u2019 businesses and the markets we serve. Such economic conditions in our markets have undermined and could in the future undermine, business confidence in our markets and cause our customers to reduce or defer their spending on new technology offerings and services, or may result in customers reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case for an extended period of time. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast customer demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans.\nEconomic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSubstantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.\nWe expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed. While innovation can help our business as we create new offerings for us to sell and provide complementary services, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For instance, while cloud based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud based solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell, leading to a reduction in our technology offerings revenue and/or profitability. In addition, some of our hardware and software technology partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to our customers. Moreover, traditional OEMs have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers. If any of these trends becomes more prevalent, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur future results will depend on our ability to continue to focus our resources and manage costs effectively.\nWe are continually implementing productivity measures and focusing on measures intended to further improve cost efficiency. We may be unable to realize all expected cost savings in connection with these efforts within the expected time frame, or at all and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs to realize them. Further, we may not be able to sustain any achieved savings in the future. Future results will depend on the success of these efforts.\nIf we are unable to control costs, we may incur losses, which could decrease our operating margins and significantly reduce or eliminate our profits. Our future profitability will depend on our ability to manage costs or increase productivity. An inability to effectively manage costs could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to manage large and complex projects and complete fixed price, fixed timeframe contracts on budget and on time.\nOur profitability and operating results are dependent on the scale of our projects and the prices we are able to charge for our technology offerings and services. We perform a significant portion of our work through fixed price contracts, in which we assume full control of the project team and manage all facets of execution. As a significant portion of our projects are on a fixed price model, we may be unable to accurately estimate the appropriate project price and successfully manage such projects. Although we use specified technical processes and our past experience to reduce the risks associated with estimating, planning and performing fixed price and fixed timeframe projects, we face the risk of cost overruns, completion delays and wage inflation in connection with these projects. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources or time required for a project or future rates of wage inflation, or if we fail to perform contractual obligations within the contractual timeframe, our profitability could suffer.\nThe challenges of managing larger and more complex projects include:\n\u25cf maintaining high quality control and process execution standards;\n\u25cf maintaining planned resource utilization rates on a consistent basis;\n\u25cf maintaining productivity levels and implementing necessary process improvements;\n\u25cf controlling project costs;\n\u25cf maintaining close customer contact and high levels of customer satisfaction;\n\u25cf recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of skilled IT professionals; and\n\u25cf maintaining effective customer relationships.\nIn addition, large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements. Such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements and may result in lower profitability levels than we anticipated upon commencing engagements.\nOur investments in new services and technologies may not be successful and our business strategy is evolving and may involve pursuing new lines of business or strategic transactions and investments, or dispositions of assets or businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives, and such efforts may not be successful.\nWe continue to invest in new services and technologies, including cloud, virtualization, security, mobility, data analytics and blockchain. The complexity of these solutions, our learning curve in developing and supporting them and significant competition in the markets for these solutions could make it difficult for us to market and implement these solutions successfully. Additionally, there is a risk that our customers may not adopt these solutions widely, which would prevent us from realizing expected returns on these investments. Even if these solutions are successful in the market, they still rely on third-party hardware and software and our ability to meet stringent service levels. If we are unable to deploy these solutions successfully or profitably, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur industry is undergoing significant change and our business strategy is continuing to evolve to meet these changes. In order to profitably grow our business, we may need to expand into new lines of business beyond our current focus of providing mobile advertising analytics products and services, which may involve pursuing strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions of, or investments in, related or unrelated businesses. In addition, we may seek divestitures of existing businesses or assets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful with our efforts to evolve our business strategy and we could suffer significant losses as a result, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue may be larger than projected.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer.\nOur success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business, including our key executive, management, sales, services and technical personnel.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our executive officers, as well as the continued service and support of other key employees. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technology specialists, engineers and consultants, for whom the market is extremely competitive.\nOur inability to attract, develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our technology partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of technology offerings and services. Moreover, our inability to train our sales, services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel. Such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIt may be difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of changes in the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles. Further, applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual\u2019s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, our business and our ability to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on Nasdaq could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and personnel may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe our brand name and our reputation in the marketplace are important corporate assets that help distinguish our technology offerings and services from those of competitors and contribute to our ability to recruit and retain talented personnel, in particular our engineers and consulting professionals. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with customers, cybersecurity breaches, service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former customers, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, partners, joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators, or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about us, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of our brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting the Successor\u2019s share price.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and may divert management\u2019s attention and, if unsuccessful, harm our business.\nWe may choose to expand by making additional acquisitions that could be material to our business. We have in the past made several acquisitions of complementary businesses, including acquisitions in Odyssey, Simplikate, Digby, Tapit! and GoTV. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:\n\u25cf an acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u25cf we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u25cf an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, or distract our management;\n\u25cf an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company we acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;\n\u25cf we may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired technology offerings or services;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf the challenges inherent in effectively managing an increased number of employees in diverse locations;\n\u25cf the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u25cf the potential known and unknown liabilities associated with an acquired company;\n\u25cf our use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for our cash;\n\u25cf if we incur additional debt to fund such acquisitions, such debt may subject us to additional material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as additional financial maintenance covenants;\n\u25cf the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets or goodwill in future acquisitions;\n\u25cf to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity or equity linked securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and\n\u25cf managing the varying intellectual property protection strategies and other activities of an acquired company.\nWe may not succeed in addressing these or other risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business. The inability to integrate successfully the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired business, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to recognize revenue in the period in which our services are performed, which may cause our margins to fluctuate.\nOur services are performed under both time and material and fixed price contract arrangements. All revenue is recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards. Our failure to meet all the obligations, or otherwise meet a customer\u2019s expectations, may result in us having to record the cost related to the performance of services in the period that services were rendered, but delay the timing of revenue recognition to a future period in which all obligations have been met.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. We are required to implement this guidance in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, as we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The most significant impact relates to our accounting for subscriptions to our MaaS licenses and application development services, which may potentially make revenue more volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, accounting for commissions is impacted significantly as we have to capitalize and amortize most commissions under the new standard instead of expensing commissions as incurred. Due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard is dependent on contract-specific terms. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements or adequately accounting after adoption could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us. In addition, to adopt the new standard we had to implement a new revenue recognition module in our accounting system, hire consultants and increase our spending on audit fees, thereby increasing our general and administrative expense. That increased spending will continue through at least our first fiscal quarter of 2019 and will likely increase our audit fees on an ongoing basis thereafter.\nThere has been limited precedence set for financial accounting of digital assets, it is unclear how the Company will be required to account for digital assets transactions in the future.\nThere has been limited precedence set for the financial accounting of digital assets, including the accounting around the issuance of our digital asset, PhunCoin. It is unclear how the Company will be required to account for issuances of its own digital asset, transactions or digital asset it holds on its balance sheet. Furthermore, a change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to restate the Company\u2019s financial statements. Such a restatement could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account, including accounting for PhunCoin, and harm investors.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:\n\u25cf changes in spending on subscriptions, services and application transactions media offerings and services by our current or prospective customers;\n\u25cf pricing our technology offerings and services effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our operating results;\n\u25cf attracting new customers and increasing our existing customers\u2019 use of our technology offerings and services;\n\u25cf the mix between new contracts and renewals;\n\u25cf customer renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed;\n\u25cf seasonality and its effect on customer demand;\n\u25cf awareness of our brand;\n\u25cf changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new technologies and technology enhancements;\n\u25cf changes to the commission plans, quotas and other compensation related metrics for our sales representatives;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expense;\n\u25cf our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including disruptions in our hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\n\u25cf customer delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u25cf changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses (including marketing events and commissions and bonuses associated with performance) and employee benefit expenses;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments and other non-cash charges;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers and the mix of quarterly and annual billings;\n\u25cf introduction and adoption of our marketing solutions in markets outside of the United States;\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u25cf awareness of our thought leadership and brand on a global basis;\n\u25cf changes in the levels of our capital expenditures;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future technology offerings and services, size or duration of contracts, revenue and expenses and, as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates.\nWe could be held liable for damages or our reputation could suffer from security breaches or disclosure of confidential information or personal data.\nWe are dependent on technology networks and systems to process, transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations and with our customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data, including personal data. In addition, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers\u2019 businesses. The theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our, or our customers\u2019, confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services. Any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm, regardless of our responsibility for the failure.\nIn addition, we often have access to or are required to manage, utilize, collect and store sensitive or confidential customer or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the European Union\u2019s GDPR and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs, we could be subject to liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws and/or criminal prosecution, as well as significant liability to our customers or our customers\u2019 clients\u2019 for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud based offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers\u2019 businesses, especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry. The loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer or employee data, including personal data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our customers, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation, which could in turn harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf we cause disruptions in our customers\u2019 businesses or provide inadequate service, our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us, which could cause us to lose customers, have a negative effect on our corporate reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we make errors in the course of delivering services to our customers or fail to consistently meet our service level obligations or other service requirements of our customers, these errors or failures could disrupt our customer\u2019s business, which could result in a reduction in our revenue or a claim for substantial damages against us. In addition, a failure or inability by us to meet a contractual requirement could subject us to penalties, cause us to lose customers or damage our brand or corporate reputation and limit our ability to attract new business.\nThe services we provide are often critical to our customers\u2019 businesses. Certain of our customer contracts require us to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data, ensuring our network is virus free, maintaining business continuity planning procedures and verifying the integrity of employees that work with our customers by conducting background checks. Any failure in a customer\u2019s system, failure of our data center, cloud or other offerings, or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the customer could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us. Any significant failure of our equipment or systems, or any major disruption to basic infrastructure in the locations in which we operate, such as power and telecommunications, could impede our ability to provide services to our customers, have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose customers and adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnder our customer contracts, our liability for breach of our obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract. Such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages. In addition, certain liabilities, such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our customers, are generally not limited under our contracts. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in amounts greater than those covered by our current insurance policies could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful, we may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees.\nOur technology offerings and services could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to use intellectual property of others.\nWe cannot be sure that our brand, technology offerings and services, including, for example, the software solutions of others that we offer to our customers, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future, or require us to rebrand. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenue we receive from the customer. Any claims or litigation in this area, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation, and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our customers. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or, alternatively, substitute a non-infringing technology, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be harmed. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in defending a trademark claim, we could be forced to re-brand, which could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets where their sole or primary purpose is to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any such action naming us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our customer or our own services or operations, causing further damages.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries in which we operate or may operate in the future may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit its ability to protect our intellectual property. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. The validity and enforceability of any intellectual property right we obtain may be challenged by others and, to the extent we have enforceable intellectual property rights, those intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing technology offerings and services similar to or duplicative of us. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nIf we are unable to collect our receivables from, or bill our unbilled services to, our customers, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our customers of the amounts they owe us for technology offerings sold or services performed. We typically evaluate the financial condition of our customers and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. We maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on customer balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our customers, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency, or bankruptcy, and, as a result, could cause customers to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Timely collection of customer balances also depends on our ability to complete its contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenue. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our customer balances and if this occurs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIncreased costs of labor and employee health and welfare benefits may adversely impact our results of operations.\nGiven our number of employees, labor related costs represent a significant portion of our expenses. An increase in labor costs, for example, as a result of increased competition for skilled labor, or employee benefit costs, such as health care costs or otherwise, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur global operations are subject to complex risks, some of which might be beyond our control.\nOur customers have operations across North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and other locations. Although international revenue currently represents a small portion of our business, our revenue from customers outside of the United States may expand in the future as we expand our international presence. As a result, we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and/or contractual rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers, potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, international hostilities, terrorism and natural disasters. Expansion of international operations also increases the likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations. We may also face difficulties integrating any new facilities in different countries into our existing operations, as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEconomic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our customers operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our marketing solutions and negatively impact our operating results.\nGeneral worldwide economic conditions have experienced a significant downturn and fluctuations in recent years and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread. As a result, we and our customers find it extremely difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. In addition, these conditions could cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce their marketing and sales budgets, which could decrease corporate spending on our marketing solutions, resulting in delayed and lengthened sales cycles, a decrease in new customer acquisition and/or loss of customers. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our customers may face issues with their cash flows and with gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us, impact customer renewal rates and adversely affect our revenue. If such conditions occur, we may be required to increase our reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable and our operating results would be harmed. In addition, a downturn in the technology sector may disproportionately affect us because a significant portion of our customers are technology companies. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, whether global, regional or within specific markets. If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if the overall economy does not worsen or improves, the market for marketing software may not experience growth or we may not experience growth.\nIf platform subscriptions renewal rates decrease, or we do not accurately predict subscription renewal rates, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their subscription period, which is typically one year, but generally ranges from one to three years. In addition, our customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. We may not accurately predict renewal rates for our customers. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer usage, pricing changes, number of applications used by our customers, customer satisfaction with our service, increased competition, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional services and functionality to our existing customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must add new customers, encourage existing customers to renew their subscriptions on terms favorable to us, increase their usage of our solutions and sell additional functionality and services to existing customers. As our industry matures, as interactive channels develop further, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell and renew based on pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. In addition, attracting, retaining and growing our relationship with enterprise customers may require us to effectively employ different strategies than we have historically used with current customers and we may face challenges in doing so. As a result, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers or new business from existing customers on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.\nBecause we recognize revenue from platform subscriptions and services over the term of the relevant contract, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a subscription-based business, we recognize revenue over the term of each of our contracts, which is typically one year, but ranges from one to three years. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter results from contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in the future. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new sales or renewals of our marketing solutions will not be reflected in full in our operating results until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nIf we fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our solutions, which typically extends for several months, may cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales efforts, and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock.\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our technology offerings and services could delay new sales and cause our revenue and cash flows for any given quarter to fail to meet our projections or market expectations.\nThe sales cycle between our initial contact with a potential customer and the signing of a contract to provide technology offerings and services varies. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete transactions could harm our business and financial results and could cause our financial results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in our potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements and budget cycles and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u25cf the timing of our customers\u2019 budget cycles; and\n\u25cf the length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes.\nPrivacy concerns and consumers\u2019 acceptance of Internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our marketing solutions.\nPrivacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect consumer privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. For example, the ECJ Ruling had the effect of invalidating the Safe Harbor framework. As a result, the framework no longer provides a valid legal basis for companies to transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States. Companies, including our customers, must comply with relevant aspects of European Union data protection laws using alternate mechanisms and our customers may not implement the alternate mechanisms that we offer. Additionally, our alternative measures may be challenged or deemed insufficient. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. In addition to government activity privacy advocacy groups and the marketing and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by, the foregoing laws, regulations, policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our cloud-based marketing solutions and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action.\nWe require significant additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will be higher than our net revenue for the foreseeable future, we currently lack sufficient working capital and, as a standalone entity without giving effect to the Business Combination, we do not currently have financing available to pay all liabilities as they are scheduled to come due in the next twelve months. We are working on several contingency plans within our control to conserve existing liquidity through the reduction of discretionary expenses. We are also exploring various alternatives including debt and equity financing vehicles, alternative offerings (launching an offering for a new token pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act) strategic partnerships and the Business Combination.\nOur cash requirements relate primarily to our current negative working capital balance plus working capital needed to operate and grow our business, including funding operating expenses and continued development and expansion of our services. We are currently unable to fund our operations without additional external financing and therefore cannot sustain future operations, we may be required to delay, reduce and/or cease our operations and/or seek bankruptcy protection. Although we have successfully raised funds from investors in the past, no assurances can be made that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional capital to satisfy the current negative working capital balances and future operations. Furthermore, if adequate additional funds are not available, we will be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of the implementation of our business strategy, including potential additional acquisitions or internally-developed businesses, which could seriously harm our business and operating results.\nAdditionally, even if we raise sufficient capital through additional equity or debt financings, warrant exercises, strategic alternatives or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the revenue or capital infusion will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where it will be profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. The debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets and the terms of any debt securities issued could also impose significant restrictions on our operations. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Our warrants may and could be exercised on a cashless basis. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and/or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe intend to raise capital through exercises of our warrants by registering the warrants and common shares underlying those warrants; however, there are no guarantees that that warrant holders will exercise, warrant holders will exercise in cash, the effectiveness of the registration statement will be timely or occur at all. The Company may further elect to redeem the Public Warrants.\nThe Company had 6,900,610 common stock warrants (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) outstanding trading under the Nasdaq ticker symbol PHUNW as of the date of this Report. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to file a new registration statement under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock underlying the Public Warrants, following the completion of the Business Combination. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50. The Public Warrants became exercisable for cash 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. However, if any such registration statement has not been declared effective by the 90th day following the closing of the Business Combination, holders of the Public Warrants shall have the right, during the period beginning on the 91st day after the closing of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization and ending upon such registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and during any other period when the Company shall fail to have maintained an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants, the holders may exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last sale price of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders.\nThe remainder our warrants are currently exercisable with cash or on a cashless basis.\nWe intend to raise capital to fund a Token Generation Event, pursuant to a Rule 506(c) of Regulation D offering by our wholly-owned subsidiary, PhunCoin, Inc. (\u201cPhunCoin Sub\u201d) of rights to receive future PhunCoin. There can be no assurance that the PhunCoin will ever be issued and, any significant difficulties we and PhunCoin Sub may experience with the offering could result in claims against us, and the Token Generation Event and PhunCoin will subject us to various other business and regularity uncertainties.\nPursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of February 27, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) among Stellar, Phunware and certain other parties, as amended by the first amendment to the Merger Agreement dated as of November 1, 2018, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to raise between $10 million and $100 million through a PhunCoin offering. In accordance with that obligation, in June 2018, PhunCoin Sub launched an offering to raise capital by offering investors the right to acquire PhunCoin pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act. As of the date of this Annual Report, $990 thousand has been raised in the rights offering. We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and issue PhunCoin, but there is no assurance that it will do so. If the Token Generation Event, defined as the launch of the PhunCoin Ecosystem, is not consummated or the rights offering does not result in substantial proceeds, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash position. If the Token Generation Event is not consummated, we would have to reduce our planned expenditures and/or would require additional funding from other sources in order to carry out our business plan. Also, any significant difficulties we may experience with the Token Generation Event or the development of the PhunCoin could result in claims against us and could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock.\nThe growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the networks on which PhunCoin will rely to consummate the Token Generation Event, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The cryptocurrency and cryptosecurities industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving. The slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may materially adversely affect our business plans to launch and maintain PhunCoin. For example, given the regulatory complexity with respect to cryptocurrency and related digital assets, complying with such regulations, which could change in the future or be subject to new interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to develop, launch and continue to operate PhunCoin and the PhunCoin Ecosystem, which is intended to be a rewards marketplace and data exchange whereby users receive PhunCoin in exchange for their information and PhunCoin can be redeemed by users for goods and services. In addition, the tax and accounting consequences to us of the Token Generation Event and PhunCoin are uncertain, which could lead to incorrect reporting, classification or liabilities. If the Token Generation Event occurs and PhunCoin is developed, its structural foundation, the software applications and other interfaces or applications upon which it relies or that will be built are unproven. There can be no assurances that PhunCoin will be fully secure, which may result in impermissible transfers, a complete loss of users\u2019 PhunCoin on the PhunCoin Ecosystem or an unwillingness of users to access, adopt and utilize PhunCoin, whether through system faults or malicious attacks. Any such faults or attacks on PhunCoin may materially and adversely affect our business.\nBecause PhunCoin will be a digital asset built and transacted initially on top of Stellar, an existing blockchain technology, Phunware is reliant on another blockchain network, and users are subject to the risk of wallet incompatibility and blockchain protocol risks.\nWe have decided to initially use the Stellar blockchain as the underlying blockchain technology to create the PhunCoin Ecosystem, although we may choose another blockchain technology in the future. Reliance upon another blockchain technology subjects us and PhunCoin Ecosystem users to the risk of digital wallet incompatibility, or additional ecosystem malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of, or attack on, the Stellar blockchain protocol, which may cause PhunCoin to malfunction or function in an unexpected manner, including, but not limited to, slowdown or complete cessation in functionality of the network.\nThe PhunCoin Ecosystem is designed to distribute PhunCoin to consumers in exchange for their agreement to provide certain personal information to us. Providing this data exposes us to risks of privacy data breach and cybersecurity attacks.\nWe utilize a substantial amount of electronic information. This includes transaction information and sensitive personal information of the users of the PhunCoin Ecosystem. The service providers used by us, may also use, store, and transmit such information. We intend to implement detailed cybersecurity policies and procedures and an incident response plan designed to protect such information and prevent data loss and security breaches.\nThere can be no assurances that PhunCoin or a user\u2019s data will be fully secure, which may result in impermissible transfer, a complete loss of users\u2019 PhunCoin or data on the PhunCoin Ecosystem or an unwillingness of users to access, adopt and utilize PhunCoin, whether through system faults or malicious attacks. Any such faults or attacks on PhunCoin and users\u2019 data may materially and adversely affect PhunCoin and the PhunCoin Ecosystem. There are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the PhunCoin Ecosystem\u2019s reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of its security measures, negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the PhunCoin Ecosystem or PhunCoin. We may be compelled to disclose personal information about a user or users of the PhunCoin Ecosystem to federal or state government regulators or taxation authorities. Accordingly, certain information concerning users may be shared outside Phunware.\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, utility tokens, and offerings of digital assets and utility tokens such as PhunCoin is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of PhunCoin.\nRegulation of digital assets, like PhunCoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. In addition, any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information in connection with PhunCoin could subject us to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties. Any such violations could adversely affect the ability of Phunware to maintain PhunCoin, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.\nThe actual market for our solutions could be significantly smaller than estimates of total potential market opportunity and if customer demand for our services does not meet expectations, our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect strong growth in the markets for our products, it is possible that the growth in some or all of these markets may not meet our expectations, or materialize at all. The methodology on which our estimate of our total potential market opportunity is based includes several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge and customer experience. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our solutions could be significantly smaller than our estimates of our total potential market opportunity. If the customer demand for our services or the adoption rate in our target markets does not meet our expectations, our ability to generate revenue from customers and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on advertising agencies as intermediaries and this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business.\nNearly all of our application transaction revenue comes from executing brand advertising campaigns for advertising agencies that purchase our solutions on behalf of their advertiser customers. Advertising agencies are instrumental in assisting brand owners to plan and purchase advertising and each advertising agency will allocate advertising spend from brands across numerous channels. We do not have exclusive relationships with advertising agencies and we depend on agencies to work with us as they embark on marketing campaigns for brands. While in some cases we are invited by advertising agencies to present directly to their advertiser customers or otherwise have developed a relationship directly with an advertiser, we nevertheless depend on advertising agencies to present to their advertiser customers the merits of our digital video advertising solutions. Inaccurate descriptions of our digital video advertising solutions by advertising agencies, over which we have no control, negative recommendations to use our service offerings or failure to mention our solutions at all could hurt our business. In addition, if an advertising agency is dissatisfied with our solutions on a marketing campaign or in general, we risk losing the business of the advertiser for whom the campaign was run and of other advertisers represented by that agency. With advertising agencies acting as intermediaries for multiple brands, our customer base is more concentrated than might be reflected by the number of brand advertisers for which we conduct marketing campaigns. Since many advertising agencies are affiliated with other agencies in a larger corporate structure, if we fail to maintain good relations with one agency in such an organization, we may lose business from the affiliated agencies as well.\nOur sales could be adversely impacted by industry changes relating to the use of advertising agencies. For example, if advertisers seek to bring their marketing campaigns in-house rather than using an advertising agency, we would need to develop direct relationships with the advertisers, which we might not be able to do and which could increase our sales and marketing expense. Moreover, because of dealing primarily with advertising agencies, we have a less direct relationship with advertisers than would be the case if advertisers dealt with us directly. This may drive advertisers to attribute the value we provide to the advertising agency rather than to us, further limiting our ability to develop long-term relationships directly with advertisers. Advertisers may move from one advertising agency to another, and, accordingly, even if we have a positive relationship with an advertising agency, we may lose the underlying business when an advertiser switches to a new agency. The presence of advertising agencies as intermediaries between us and the advertisers thus creates a challenge to building our own brand awareness and affinity with the advertisers that are the ultimate source of our revenue.\nIn addition, our advertising agency customers may offer components of our solutions, including selling advertising inventory through their own sources. As a result, these advertising agencies are, or may become, our competitors. If they further develop their capabilities they may be more likely to offer their own solutions to advertisers, which could compromise our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to detect advertising fraud or other actions that impact our advertising campaign performance, we could harm our reputation with advertisers or agencies, which would cause our revenue and business to suffer.\nOur business relies on our ability to deliver successful and effective video advertising campaigns. Some of those campaigns may experience fraudulent and other invalid impressions, clicks or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable, such as non-human traffic generated by machines that are designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user traffic on websites. These activities could overstate the performance of any given video advertising campaign and could harm our reputation. It may be difficult for us to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not own content and rely in part on our digital media properties to control such activity. These risks become more pronounced as the digital video industry shifts to programmatic buying. Industry self-regulatory bodies, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and certain influential members of Congress have increased their scrutiny and awareness of and have taken recent actions to address, advertising fraud and other malicious activity. While we routinely review the campaign performance on our digital media properties\u2019 inventory, such reviews may not detect or prevent fraudulent or malicious activity. If we fail to detect or prevent fraudulent or other malicious activity, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed. High levels of fraudulent or malicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions, refusals to pay, refund or future credit demands or withdrawal of future business. In addition, advertisers increasingly rely on third party vendors to measure campaigns against audience guarantee, viewability and other requirements and to detect fraud. If we are unable to successfully integrate our technology with such vendors, or our measurement and fraud detection differs from their findings, our customers could lose confidence in our solutions, we may not get paid for certain campaigns and our revenues could decrease. Further, if we are unable to detect fraudulent or other malicious activities and advertisers demand fraud-free inventory, our supply could fall drastically, making it impossible to sustain our current business model. If we fail to detect fraudulent or other malicious activities that impact the performance of our brand advertising campaigns, we could harm our reputation with our advertisers or agencies and our revenue and business would suffer.\nThe mobile advertising market may develop more slowly than expected, which could harm our business.\nIf the market for mobile marketing and advertising develops more slowly than we expect, our business could suffer. Our future success is highly dependent on the commitment of advertisers and marketers to mobile communications as an advertising and marketing medium, the willingness of our potential advertisers to outsource their mobile advertising and marketing needs and our ability to sell our mobile advertising services to reseller partners and agencies. The mobile advertising and marketing market is rapidly evolving. Businesses, including current and potential advertisers, may find mobile advertising or marketing to be less effective than traditional advertising media or marketing methods or other technologies for promoting their products and services. As a result, the future demand and market acceptance for mobile marketing and advertising is uncertain. Many of our current or potential advertisers may have little or no experience using mobile communications for advertising or marketing purposes and have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising or marketing budgets to mobile communications advertising or marketing and there is no certainty that they will allocate more funds in the future, if any. Funds to these types of campaigns may fluctuate greatly as different agencies and advertisers test and refine their overall marketing strategies to include mobile advertising and analytics tools. The adoption rate and budget commitments may vary from period to period as agencies and advertisers determine the appropriate mix of media and lead sources in short term and longer-term campaigns.\nWe may be unable to deliver advertising in a context that is appropriate for mobile advertising campaigns, which could harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.\nIt is very important to advertisers that their brand advertisements not be placed in or near content that is unlawful or would be deemed offensive or inappropriate by their customers. Unlike advertising on television, where the context in which an advertiser\u2019s ad will appear is highly predictable and controlled, digital media content is more unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that digital video advertisements will appear in a context that is appropriate for the brand. We rely on continued access to premium ad inventory in high-quality and brand-safe environments, viewable to consumers across multiple screens. If we are not successful in delivering context appropriate digital video advertising campaigns for advertisers, our reputation will suffer and our ability to attract potential advertisers and retain and expand business with existing advertisers could be harmed, or our customers may seek to avoid payment or demand future credits for inappropriately placed advertisements, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses and expect to continue to experience those gains and losses; fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to foreign currency exposures that arise from British Pound Sterling and Euro denominated transactions that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency transaction exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to mitigate our foreign currency exposures, if our mitigation efforts are ineffective, or if we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver ads and to disclose data relating to the performance of our ads; any limitation on these practices could significantly diminish the value of our solutions and cause us to lose customers and revenue.\nWhen we deliver an ad to an internet-connected device, we are able to collect information about the placement of the ad and the interaction of the device user with the ad, such as whether the user visited a landing page or watched a video. We are also able to collect information about the user\u2019s IP address, device, mobile location and some demographic characteristics. We may also contract with one or more third parties to obtain additional pseudonymous information about the device user who is viewing a particular ad, including information about the user\u2019s interests. As we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and scheduling of ads across the advertising inventory provided to us by digital media properties.\nAlthough the data we collect does not enable us to determine the actual identity of any individual, our customers or end users might decide not to allow us to collect some or all of the data or might limit our use of it. For example, a digital media property might not agree to provide us with data generated by interactions with the content on its apps, or device users might not consent to share their information about device usage. Any limitation on our ability to collect data about user behavior and interaction with content could make it more difficult for us to deliver effective digital video advertising programs that meet the demands of our customers. This in turn could harm our revenue and impair our business.\nAlthough our contracts with advertisers generally permit us to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, sometimes an advertiser declines to permit the use of this data, which limits the usefulness of the data that we collect. Furthermore, advertisers may request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other advertisers\u2019 campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests and complying with these kinds of requests could cause us to spend significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection, use and processing of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze the data from our customers\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertising customers, which could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose customers and our revenue may decline.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities, restrictions on our business or reputational harm as a result of evolving governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn the course of providing our solutions, we collect, transmit and store information related to and seeking to correlate internet-connected devices, user activity and the ads we place. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, processing, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect across our advertising solutions. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data collection, processing use and disclosure. However, the applicability of specific laws may be unclear in some cases and domestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices and data tracking technologies is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. In addition, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is new or inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. federal, state or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data, security or consumer protection, or disclosure or unauthorized access by third parties to this information, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, competitors, private parties or others. Any proceedings or actions against us alleging violations of consumer or data protection laws or asserting privacy-related theories could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our solutions and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our customers from the costs or consequences of litigation resulting from using our solutions or from the disclosure of confidential information, which could damage our reputation among our current and potential customers, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving worldwide and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the digital advertising industry in particular. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business, particularly with regard to collection or use of data to target ads and communication with consumers and the international transfer of data from Europe to the U.S. The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices. In Europe, in October 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the \u201cU.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework,\u201d which created a safe harbor under the European Data Protection Directive for certain European data transfers to the U.S. We had not self-certified under this regime and therefore were not directly affected by this decision. In July 2016, the European Commission approved the Privacy Shield, which is a set of principles and related rules that are intended to replace the U.S.-EU Safe harbor framework. We are in the process of determining whether to join the Privacy Shield program. Stricter regulation of European data transfers to U.S. in future may impact our ability to serve European customers effectively, or require us to open and operate datacenters in the European Union which would result in a higher cost of doing business in these jurisdictions.\nIn particular, the GDPR extends the jurisdictional scope of European data protection law. As a result, we will be subject to the GDPR when we provide our targeting services in Europe. The GDPR imposes stricter data protection requirements that may necessitate changes to our services and business practices. Potential penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR include administrative fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.\nThe FTC has also adopted revisions to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) that expand liability for the collection of information by operators of websites and other electronic solutions that are directed to children. Questions exist as to how regulators and courts may interpret the scope and circumstances for potential liability under COPPA and the FTC continues to provide guidance and clarification as to its 2013 revisions of COPPA. FTC guidance or enforcement precedent may make it difficult or impractical for us to provide advertising on certain websites, services or applications. In addition, the FTC recently fined an ad network for certain methods of collecting and using data from mobile applications, including certain applications directed at children and failing to disclose the data collection to mobile application developers in their network.\nWhile we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, physical address, phone numbers or social security numbers, we typically collect and store IP addresses, geo-location information and device or other persistent identifiers that are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. For example, some jurisdictions in the EU regard IP addresses as personal data and certain regulators, such as the California Attorney General\u2019s Office, have advocated for including IP addresses, GPS-level geolocation data and unique device identifiers as personal data under California law. Furthermore, the GDPR makes clear that online identifiers (such as IP addresses and other device identifiers) will be treated as \u201cpersonal data\u201d going forward and therefore subject to stricter data protection rules.\nEvolving definitions of personal data within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to the classification of IP addresses, machine or device identifiers, geo-location data and other such information, may cause us to change our business practices, diminish the quality of our data and the value of our solution and hamper our ability to expand our offerings into the European Union or other jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our failure to comply with evolving interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, or to adequately protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to compliance with government regulations, we voluntarily participate in trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct addressing the provision of internet advertising. We could be adversely affected by changes to these guidelines and codes in ways that are inconsistent with our practices or in conflict with the laws and regulations of U.S. or international regulatory authorities. For instance, new guidelines, codes, or interpretations, by self-regulatory organizations or government agencies, may require additional disclosures, or additional consumer consents, such as \u201copt-in\u201d permissions to share, link or use data, such as health data from third parties, in certain ways. If we fail to abide by, or are perceived as not operating in accordance with, industry best practices or any industry guidelines or codes with regard to privacy, our reputation may suffer and we could lose relationships with advertisers and digital media properties.\nAny inability to deliver successful mobile advertising campaigns due to technological challenges or an inability to persuasively demonstrate success will prevent us from growing or retaining our current advertiser base.\nIt is critical that we deliver successful mobile advertising campaigns on behalf of our advertisers. Factors that may adversely affect our ability to deliver successful mobile advertising campaigns include:\n\u25cf Inability to accurately process data and extract meaningful insights and trends, such as the failure to accurately process data to place ads effectively at digital media properties;\n\u25cf Faulty or out-of-date algorithms that fail to properly process data or result in inability to capture brand-receptive audiences at scale;\n\u25cf Technical or infrastructure problems causing digital video not to function, display properly or be placed next to inappropriate context;\n\u25cf Inability to control video completion rates, maintain user attention or prevent end users from skipping advertisements;\n\u25cf Inability to detect and prevent advertising fraud and other malicious activity;\n\u25cf Inability to fulfill audience guarantee or viewability requirements of advertiser customers;\n\u25cf Inability to integrate with third parties that measure campaigns against audience guarantee or viewability requirements;\n\u25cf Unavailability of campaign data for advertisers to effectively measure the success of their campaigns; and\n\u25cf Access to quality inventory at sufficient volumes to meet the needs of advertisers\u2019 campaigns.\nOur ability to deliver successful advertising campaigns also depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our own internal and third party managed systems, which we utilize to place ads, monitor the performance of advertising campaigns and manage advertising inventory. Our revenue depends on the technological ability of our solutions to deliver ads and measure them. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide solutions to customers, including security breaches and other technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to collect and process data in connection with these ads, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers, negatively impact operations and reduce our revenue. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing system failures. Also, advertisers may perceive any technical disruption or failure in ad performance on digital media properties\u2019 platforms to be attributable to us and our reputation could similarly suffer, or advertisers may seek to avoid payment or demand future credits for disruptions or failures, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. If we are unable to deliver successful advertising campaigns, our ability to attract potential advertisers and retain and expand business with existing advertisers could be harmed and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, earthquake, mudslides, fire or flood, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. We have an office and at least one data center located in California, a region known for earthquakes and mudslides. A significant amount of our development and ad operations work is located in California. We also have corporate offices in Texas and Florida, both of which are susceptible to floods and hurricanes. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our advertisers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting California, Texas or Florida. As we rely heavily on our data centers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our advertisers\u2019 businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nActivities of our advertising customers with which we do business could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nWe do not monitor or have the ability to control whether our advertising customers\u2019 advertising of their products and solutions complies with federal, state, local and foreign laws. Failure of our advertising customers to comply with federal, state, local or foreign laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver if the content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. A third party or regulatory authority may file a claim against us even if our advertising customer has represented that its ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad. Any of these claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation within the advertising industry. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our solutions or otherwise expend significant resources. Similarly, we do not monitor or have the ability to control whether digital media property owners with which we do business are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or intellectual property rights of others and their failure to do so could expose us to legal liability. Third parties may claim that we should be liable to them for content on digital media properties if the content violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws or other brand protection measures. These risks become more pronounced as the digital video industry shifts to programmatic buying.\nOur agreements with partners, employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely in part on confidentiality agreements and other restrictions with our customers, partners, employees, consultants and others to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, processes and methods, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, products and intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where applicable laws may be less protective of intellectual property rights than those in the United States and where enforcement mechanisms for intellectual property rights may be weak. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We use significant judgment in evaluating our worldwide income-tax provision. During the ordinary course of business, we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income-tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur international operations subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are either not applicable or an exemption from such taxes applies. Sales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future, including as a result of a change in law. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including any limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Code as a result of our past ownership changes or an ownership change in connection with the Business Combination. At December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $98.3 million, of which $12.6 million will never expire and $85.7 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2030. At December 31, 2018, we had state and local net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $51.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2030.\nWe periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover net deferred tax assets. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible profits. As a result of this analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that a valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets should be applied as of December 31, 2018. To the extent we determine that all or a portion of our valuation allowance is no longer necessary, we will recognize an income tax benefit in the period this determination is made for the reversal of the valuation allowance. Once the valuation allowance is eliminated or reduced, its reversal will no longer be available to offset our current tax provision. These events could have a material impact on our reported results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of sales with key customers and any substantial reduction in sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our sales were concentrated with Fox Networks Group (\u201cFox\u201d) and Fetch Media, Ltd. (\u201cFetch\u201d), which accounted for 42% and 21% of our net sales, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our sales were concentrated with Fox and Fetch, which accounted for 44% and 11%, respectively, of our net sales. Fetch and Fox are currently of key importance to our business, and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if these relationships ceased or were reduced in any material respect. We cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. Any substantial change in traffic or purchasing decisions by these customers, whether due to actions by our competitors, industry factors or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our largest customers are acquired, such acquisition may impact its advertising spending or budget with us, arising from factors such as rebranding, change in advertising agency, or change in media tactics. A significant reduction in advertising spending or budgets by our largest customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, if not replaced by new customers or an increase in business from other existing customers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur large customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may request us to develop additional features without providing us additional revenue, may require penalties for failure to deliver such features, may seek discounted product or service pricing and may seek more favorable contractual terms. As we sell more products and services to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions. Such large customers also have substantial leverage in negotiating the resolution of any disagreements or disputes that may arise between us. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf some of our customers experience financial distress or suffer disruptions in their business, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a diverse customer base and, at any given time, one or more customers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their businesses. If a customer with whom we do a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty or suffers disruptions in its business, it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable, result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not maintain and grow a critical mass of advertisers and distribution partners, the value of our services could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the maintenance and growth of a critical mass of advertisers and distribution partners. Advertisers will generally seek the most competitive return on investment from advertising and marketing services. Distribution partners will also seek the most favorable payment terms available in the market. Advertisers and distribution partners may change providers or the volume of business with a provider, unless the product and terms are competitive. In this environment, we must compete to acquire and maintain our network of advertisers and distribution partners. If our business is unable to maintain and grow our base of advertisers, our current distribution partners may be discouraged from continuing to work with us and this may create obstacles for us to enter into agreements with new distribution partners. Our business also depends in part on certain of our large reseller partners and agencies to grow their base of advertisers, as these advertisers become increasingly important to our business and our ability to attract additional distribution partners and opportunities. Similarly, if our distribution network does not grow and does not continue to improve over time, current and prospective advertisers and distribution partners and agencies may reduce or terminate this portion of their business with us. Any decline in the number of advertisers and distribution partners could adversely affect the value of our services.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance, our financial condition could be adversely affected in the event of uninsured or inadequately insured loss or damage. Our ability to effectively recruit and retain qualified officers and directors may also be adversely affected if we experience difficulty in maintaining adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain insurance policies on terms affordable to us that would adequately insure our business and property against damage, loss or claims by third parties. To the extent our business or property suffers any damages, losses or claims by third parties that are not covered or adequately covered by insurance, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We currently have directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance as a public company to cover liability claims made against our officers and directors, we may not be able to retain or recruit qualified officers and directors to manage our company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditor, Marcum LLP, has indicated in its report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations and substantial decline in our working capital. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d qualification could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, to incur debt, or to pursue other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon the availability and terms of future funding, continued growth in services, improved operating margins and our ability to profitably meet our after-sale service commitments with existing customers. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and may not be able to continue. If we ceased operations, it is likely that all of our investors would lose their investment.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our systems and resources, divert management\u2019s attention and be costly.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations.\nWe are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We will be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we supplement our internal team with third party software and system providers to support our reporting obligations to achieve effective internal controls.\nTo the extent we do not sufficiently manage these third parties, and they fail to provide us with adequate service, we may not effectively manage our future growth which may result in ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and an increased cost of compliance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain appropriate levels of coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly members to serve on our audit committee.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Report and in other filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation by third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after our Initial Public Offering in 2016, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRisks Related to Capitalization Matters and Corporate Governance\nThe price of our common stock and warrants has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price and volume of our common stock and warrants has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate following this offering, substantially due to a variety of factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and warrants include the following:\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf the announcement of new products, solutions or technologies, investments, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float, especially considering that we became a publicly-listed company through the Business Combination with a special purpose acquisition company, and that the trading price of our common stock since the consummation of the Business Combination has been very volatile on a relatively low public float for our trading volume;\n\u25cf changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our products and future offerings;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf sales of large blocks of our common stock or warrants;\n\u25cf developments concerning intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf changes in legal, regulatory and enforcement frameworks impacting our products;\n\u25cf variations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry;\n\u25cf the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or shortfalls in our results of operations compared to levels forecast by securities analysts;\n\u25cf actual or perceived significant data breach involving our products or website;\n\u25cf litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u25cf governmental or regulatory actions or audits;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf flash crashes,\u201d \u201cfreeze flashes\u201d or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed; and\n\u25cf major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock and/or warrants could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock and warrants might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom December 28, 2018, the date our common stock began trading on Nasdaq, through March 13, 2019, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $10.84 per share to $308.40 per share on an average trading volume of 14,401, and the closing price of our warrants has ranged from $0.22 per warrant to $0.84 per warrant on an average trading volume of approximately 238,000. From time to time, we may have volatility in our stock or warrant prices for reasons that are unknown to us.\nAs of the date of this Report, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock collectively beneficially own over 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and continue to have substantial control over us, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nAs of the date of this Report, our executive officers, directors and each of our stockholders who own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own over 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, our business, our market or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and warrants in the public market after this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and warrants and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock or warrants at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nAt the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsors and our officers, directors and stockholders owning more than 1% of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (each, a \u201cSignificant Stockholder\u201d) is subject to a lock-up or such Significant Stockholder is otherwise subject to substantially similar transfer restrictions in favor of Phunware (the \u201cLock-Ups\u201d). Pursuant to such Lock-Ups, each such holder agreed not to, during the period commencing from the consummation of the Business Combination and ending on the earlier of (A) the 180 days of the date of the consummation of the Business Combination and (B) the date after the consummation of the Business Combination on which we consummate a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in Phunware for cash, securities or other property: (x) lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any restricted securities, (y) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the restricted securities, or (z) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) above is to be settled by delivery of restricted securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise. When the lock-up period in the Lock-Ups expires, the locked-up security holders will be able to sell our shares in the public market.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. However, our Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the holder\u2019s option in an amount equal to 104% of the original purchase price for such shares. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment, if any.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock and warrants. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u25cf a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that directors may only be removed from our board of directors for cause;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 662\u22153% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Phunware.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our board of directors or management.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which may generally prohibit certain stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation will designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, each of which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Phunware, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or agent to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nOur certificate of incorporation will also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm its results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16400, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PHUN"}
