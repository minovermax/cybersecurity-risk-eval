{"cik": "820313", "company": "AMPHENOL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company\u2019s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nThe Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.\nApproximately 48% of the Company\u2019s 2017 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 14% of the Company\u2019s 2017 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change (see below-\u201cThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth\u201d). These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical,\nquality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 6% and 8% of the Company\u2019s 2017 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company\u2019s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.\nChanges in defense expenditures may reduce the Company\u2019s sales.\nApproximately 10% of the Company\u2019s 2017 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company\u2019s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.\nThe Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the Company\u2019s existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.\nThe Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25% of 2017 net sales. The Company\u2019s long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails, or is significantly delayed, in introducing new product line concepts or if the Company\u2019s new products are not met with market acceptance, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreements contain certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2016, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a syndicate of financial institutions (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), which also backstops the Company\u2019s commercial paper program, contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company\u2019s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Company\u2019s credit facilities, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the commercial paper program of nil and $1,175.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company relies on the capital markets, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. While the Company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while the Company has not encountered any such issues to date, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company\u2019s debt were to downgrade the Company\u2019s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Company\u2019s performance, it would likely increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors the mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as the mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1,182.0 million, or 33%, of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. A 10% change in LIBOR or floating interest rates at December 31, 2017 would not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 67% of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured Senior Notes:\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company\u2019s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations and other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company\u2019s current, non-current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to tax examinations by various tax authorities and in addition, new examinations could be initiated by tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d). The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts.\nNon-U.S. markets form a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s business and as a result, the Company is more exposed to political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside the United States.\nDuring 2017, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 72% of the Company\u2019s net sales, with China constituting approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company\u2019s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. Because the Company has extensive non-U.S. operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the U.S., it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, including:\n\u00b7\ninstability in political or economic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, recession, foreign currency exchange restrictions and devaluations, restrictive governmental controls on the movement and repatriation of earnings and capital, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u00b7\nintergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars and acts of terrorism or war; and\n\u00b7\ninterruptions to the Company\u2019s business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or cybersecurity incidents, inventory excesses, natural disasters or other disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or explosions.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. During, and following, the U.S. presidential election in 2016, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) as well as trade policies and tariffs affecting China. At this time, it is unknown whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law, pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted, international trade agreements will be negotiated, or the effect that any such action would have, either positively or negatively, on our industry or our Company. If any new legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated, it may be inefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes. Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to changes in U.S. trade policy, a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the U.S. and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which could ultimately result in:\n\u00b7\na global or regional economic slowdown in any of the Company\u2019s market segments;\n\u00b7\npostponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;\n\u00b7\neffects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;\n\u00b7\nrapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers;\n\u00b7\nemployment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;\n\u00b7\nindustrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ncredit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nchanges in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company\u2019s benefit plans; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\nThe Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisition of FCI on January 8, 2016. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. The Company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating such acquisitions, and the acquisitions may not perform as expected. At December 31, 2017, the total assets of the Company were $10,003.9 million, which included $4,042.6 million of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired). The Company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. Such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company\u2019s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.\nThe Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare earth metals and plastic resins, in its manufacturing processes. Volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such materials. In addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements, the Company\u2019s margins may decline.\nOur business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.\nWhile the Company\u2019s internal controls and systems are designed to protect it from illegal acts committed by employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners that may violate U.S. or local jurisdictional laws, there are no guarantees that such internal controls and systems will always protect the Company from such acts. Such acts may include, but are not limited to, bribery, conflicts of interest, fraud, kickbacks and money laundering. Such violations or allegations could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, lead to criminal or civil investigations in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, and ultimately result in monetary or non-monetary penalties and/or significant legal and administrative fees. Any significant violations of our standards of conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings that could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, including but not limited to, claims related to employment, tax, intellectual property, environmental, sales practices, workers compensation, product warranty, product liability and acquisitions. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in significant legal expenses. While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of proceedings, the policy may not respond in all cases and the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities.\nThe Company may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While the Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company\u2019s former or current properties, either owned or leased. Such liabilities could result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise at any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.\nCybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and the misappropriation, destruction, or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary technological information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers. Despite the Company\u2019s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from a cybersecurity incident, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84769, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "APH"}
