{"cik": "933136", "company": "Mr. Cooper Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes, when deciding to invest in us. The risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods and are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nFinancial Reporting, Credit and Liquidity Risks\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to operate our business.\nOur financing strategy includes the use of significant leverage because, in order to make servicing advances and fund originations, we require liquidity in excess of our equity, capital and that generated by our operations. Accordingly, our ability to finance our operations depends on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms and to renew and/or replace existing financings as they expire. These financings may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain these financings, we may need to raise the funds we require in the capital markets or through other means, any of which may increase our cost of funds.\nWe are generally required to renew a significant portion of our debt financing arrangements each year, which exposes us to refinancing and interest rate risks. Our ability to refinance existing debt and borrow additional funds is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe available liquidity in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nan event of default, a negative ratings action by a rating agency and limitations imposed on us under the indentures governing our current debt that contain restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions that may limit our ability to raise additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders from which we borrow; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowings on advance facilities imposed by the amount of eligible collateral pledged, which may be less than the borrowing capacity of the advance facility.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms for any of the foregoing reasons, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the aggregate principal amount of our unsecured senior notes was $2,498. Although we and our subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness, we believe we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. These agreements generally restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness; however, these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we incur additional debt, the related risks could be magnified and could limit our financial and operating activities.\nOur current and any future indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our current indebtedness and any indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy and comply with our obligations with respect to the unsecured senior notes;\n\u2022\nsubject us to increased sensitivity to increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with relatively less debt in economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events; or\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 14\nIn addition, our substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain financing or additional financing on acceptable terms to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, general corporate and other purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors outside of our control. Our substantial obligations could have other important consequences. For example, our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which limit our ability to incur liens, to incur debt and to sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could harm our business or prospects and could result in our bankruptcy.\nOur earnings may decrease because of changes in prevailing interest rates.\nOur profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The following are certain material risks we face related to changes in interest rates:\nServicing:\n\u2022\na decrease in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds which may lead to (i) increased amortization expense; (ii) decrease in servicing fees; and (iii) decrease in the value of our MSRs;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates, together with an increase in monthly payments when an adjustable mortgage loan\u2019s interest rate adjusts upward from an initial fixed rate or a low introductory rate, may cause increased delinquency, default and foreclosure. Increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures may adversely affect our business as they increase our expenses and reduce the number of mortgages we service;\nOriginations:\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing an existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a purchase money loan may be more difficult for consumers;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates could also adversely affect our production margins due to increased competition among originators;\nXome:\n\u2022\na substantial and sustained increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect the loan origination volumes of Xome\u2019s clients since refinancing and purchase loans would be less attractive to borrowers, which would in turn adversely impact Xome Services\u2019 valuation and title order volume;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates could adversely affect Xome Exchange\u2019s property sales, particularly non-distressed sales, as financing may become less attractive to borrowers;\nOther:\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding debt, including our ability to finance servicing advances and loan originations and for borrowing for acquisitions; and\n\u2022\na decrease in interest rates could reduce our earnings from our custodial deposit accounts.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n15 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe use financial models that rely heavily on estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, such as MSRs and excess spread, and if our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, it may affect our earnings.\nWe use internal financial models that utilize, wherever possible, market participant data to value certain of our assets, including our MSRs, newly originated loans held for sale and MSR financing liabilities for purposes of financial reporting. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates. In addition, the modeling requirements of MSRs are complex because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with MSRs. Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated, valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. In determining value for MSRs we make certain assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe rates of prepayment and repayment within the underlying pools of mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nprojected rates of delinquencies, defaults and liquidations;\n\u2022\nfuture interest rates;\n\u2022\nour cost to service the loans;\n\u2022\nancillary revenues; and\n\u2022\namounts of future servicing advances.\nIf these assumptions or relationships prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain assets may decrease or the value of certain liabilities could increase, which could impact our ability to satisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions, including the Merger, other previous or potential acquisitions and dispositions.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, the Assurant Mortgage Solutions acquisition or other previous or potential acquisitions, including the acquisition of assets, will depend, in part, on our ability to scale-up to appropriately service these assets and integrate the businesses of the acquired companies with our business.\nThe risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nunknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, management style, controls and procedures, servicing practices, communications and other systems including information technology systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees or clients; and\n\u2022\ninaccuracy of valuation and/or operating assumptions supporting our purchase price.\nIn the event that we acquire a platform, we may elect to operate this platform in addition to our current platform for a period of time or indefinitely. Individually or collectively, these transactions could substantially increase the UPB, or alter the composition of our portfolio of mortgage loans that we service or have an otherwise significant impact on our business. Additionally, we may make potentially significant acquisitions which could expose us to greater risks than we currently experience in servicing our current portfolio and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risks associated with disposition include, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndestabilization of the applicable operations;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 16\n\u2022\nability to obtain necessary governmental or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\npost-disposal disputes and indemnification obligations;\n\u2022\naccess by purchasers to certain of our systems and tools during transition periods;\n\u2022\nthe migration of data and separation of systems; and\n\u2022\ndata privacy matters\nWe can provide no assurances that we will enter into any such agreements or as to the timing of any potential strategic transactions. The strategic transaction process may disrupt our business including diverting management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns. We also may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of potential future strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and other tax carry forwards.\nAs of December 31, 2012, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $7.5 billion, of which approximately $6.0 billion was allocated to the portion of 2012 after the ownership change described below, that, if unused, will begin to expire in 2031. We believe that, as of December 31, 2018, we had federal NOLs of approximately $6.3 billion, of which $6.1 billion were not subject to limitation under Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Our ability to utilize NOLs and other tax carry forwards to reduce taxable income in future years could be limited for various reasons, including if projected future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carry forwards prior to their expiration and/or the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) challenges that a transaction or transactions were concluded with the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in later years to enable us to use the NOLs before they expire, or that the IRS will not challenge the use of all or any portion of the NOLs. Although we have certain transfer restrictions in place under our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board could issue additional shares of stock or permit or effect future conversions, amendments or redemptions of our stock, which, depending on their magnitude, could result in ownership changes that would trigger the imposition of additional limitations on the utilization of our NOLs under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In an attempt to minimize the likelihood of an additional ownership change occurring, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions limiting the acquisition (and disposition) of our stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 by persons or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 owning (actually or constructively), or who would own as a result of the transaction, 4.75% of the total value of our stock (including any other interests treated as stock for purposes of Section 382). Nevertheless, it is possible that we could undergo an ownership change, either by events within or outside of the control of our Board, e.g., indirect changes in the ownership of persons owning 5% of our stock. Moreover, approximately 130,000 shares of our common stock are held in escrow in an account created for the benefit of holders of disputed equity interests in connection with WMIH\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy. A subsequent release or transfer of the stock potentially could result in an ownership change at that time. In the event of a subsequent ownership change, all or part of the NOLs from 2012 and subsequent years that were not previously subject to limitations under Section 382 could also become subject to an annual limitation. Section 384 may also apply in the event of an ownership change resulting from an acquisition, which would limit the utilization of our NOLs to only certain income or gains generated from assets owned subsequent to the acquisition.\nThe IRS could challenge the amount, timing and/or use of our NOL carry forwards.\nThe amount of our NOL carry forwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. Among other things, the IRS could challenge whether an ownership change occurred with the Merger, as well as the amount, the timing and/or our use of our NOLs. Any such challenge, if successful, could significantly limit our ability to utilize a portion or all of our NOL carry forwards. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred within the meaning of Section 382 is subject to inherent uncertainty, both because of the complexity of applying Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our utilizable NOL carry forwards could be changed as a result of a successful challenge by the IRS or as a result of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities.\nPossible changes in legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\nThe rules relating to U.S. federal income taxation are periodically under review by persons involved in the legislative and administrative rulemaking processes, by the IRS and by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes, including decreases in the tax rate. Future revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely impact our ability to use some or all of the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\n17 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates.\nIn our Originations segment, we use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. We may hedge MSRs in certain rate environments. The nature and timing of hedging transactions influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility, and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have third-party credit and servicer risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operation.\nConsumer Credit Risk: We provide representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of the loans that we sell that typically are in place for the life of the loan. In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, we may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser, and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by us. Our loss estimates are affected by factors both internal and external in nature, including, level of loan sales, as well as to whom the loans are sold, the expectation of credit loss on repurchases and indemnifications, our success rate at appealing repurchase demands, our ability to recover any losses from third parties, the overall economic condition in the housing market, the economic condition of borrowers, the political environment at investor agencies and the overall U.S. and world economies. Many of the factors are beyond our control and may lead to judgments that are susceptible to change. In adverse market conditions, loans may decrease in value due to an increase in delinquencies, borrower defaults and non-payments. In addition, property values may experience losses at liquidation due to extensions in foreclosure and REO sales timelines as well as home price depreciation.\nCounterparty Credit Risk: We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to various agreements. Although certain credit facilities and warehouse lines are committed, we may experience a disruption in operations due to a lender withholding a funding of a borrowing requested on the respective credit facility.\nPrior Servicer Risk: We service mortgage loans under guidelines set forth by regulatory agencies and GSEs. Failure to meet stipulations of the servicing guidelines can result in the assessment of fines and loss of reimbursement of loan related advances, expenses, interest and servicing fees. When the servicing of a portfolio is assumed either through purchase of servicing rights or through a subservicing arrangement, various loans in the acquired portfolio may have been previously serviced in a manner that will contribute towards our not meeting certain servicing guidelines. If not recovered from a prior servicer, such events frequently lead to the eventual realization of a loss to us. The recovery process against a prior servicer can be prolonged based upon the time required by us to meet minimum loss deductibles under the indemnification provisions in our agreements with the prior servicer and for the time requirements by the prior servicer to review underlying loss events and our request for indemnification. The amounts ultimately recovered from prior servicers may differ from our estimated recoveries recorded based on the prior servicer\u2019s interpretation of responsibility for loss, which could lead to our realization of additional losses.\nCorrespondent Risk: With the recent acquisition of Pacific Union Financial LLC, we have increased our Correspondent Lending Channel whereby we purchase closed loans from Correspondent Lenders. The failure of these Correspondent Lenders to comply with any applicable laws, regulations and rules may subject us to monetary penalties or other losses. Although we have controls and procedures designed to assess areas of risk with respect to these acquired loans, including, without limitation, diligence regarding compliance with underwriting guidelines and applicable laws or regulations, we may not detect every violation of law by these Correspondent Lenders.\nAny of the above could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 18\nOperational Risks\nServicing\nA significant increase in delinquencies for the loans we own and service could have a material impact on our revenues, expenses and liquidity and on the valuation of our MSRs.\n\u2022\nRevenue. An increase in delinquencies will result in lower revenue for loans we service for GSEs and Ginnie Mae because we only collect servicing fees from GSEs and Ginnie Mae for performing loans. Additionally, while increased delinquencies generate higher ancillary revenues, including late fees, these fees do not offset the higher cost to service a delinquent loan and are not likely to be recoverable in the event that the loan is liquidated. In addition, an increase in delinquencies reduces cash held in collections and other accounts and lowers the interest income we receive.\n\u2022\nExpenses. An increase in delinquencies will result in a higher cost to service due to the increased time and effort required to collect payments from delinquent borrowers and an increase in interest expense as a result of an increase in our advancing obligations.\n\u2022\nLiquidity. An increase in delinquencies could also negatively impact our liquidity because of an increase in servicing advances resulting in an increase in borrowings under advance facilities and/or insufficient financing capacity to fund increases in advances.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. We base the price we pay for MSRs on, among other things, our projections of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of delinquencies is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If delinquencies were significantly greater than expected, the estimated fair value of our MSRs could be diminished. If the estimated fair value of MSRs is reduced, we would record a loss which would adversely impact our ability to satisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements which could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAn increase in delinquency rates could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adjust to operational changes in a timely manner to sustain profitability.\nWe may enter into arrangements with investors or other counterparties to subservice loans or provide services in areas that are new to us. We perform due diligence procedures to evaluate the feasibility of such ventures or transactions prior to their execution. The achievement of expected returns is often dependent on attainment of certain operating assumptions, such as lower operating costs or attainment of key performance metrics. To the extent we are unfamiliar with investors and/or risks assumed, or to the extent we have not demonstrated past proven performance on the operating metrics, we may not be able to adjust costs or achieve the desired operating metrics in a timely manner that will allow the return on investment as planned, which could expose us to significant financial loss.\nWe may not be able to maintain or grow our business if we do not acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on favorable terms.\nOur servicing portfolio is subject to \u201crun off,\u201d meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be prepaid prior to maturity or repaid through standard amortization of principal. As a result, our ability to maintain the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to acquire the right to service additional pools of residential mortgages, enter into additional subservicing agreements or to originate additional mortgages. We have also shifted the mix of our servicing portfolio to a greater mix of subserviced loans. While we expect this strategy to have longer-term benefits, in the short-term since subservicing revenues are earned on a fee per loan basis, this shift in our servicing portfolio to subservicing could reduce our revenue and earnings. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our pipeline of subservicing opportunities.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d) could enact more stringent requirements on the GSEs, or other federal or state agencies may enact additional requirements that are more stringent regarding the purchase or sale of MSRs. Additionally, if we do not comply with our seller/servicer obligations, the investors may not consent to approve future transfers of MSRs.\nIf we do not acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on terms favorable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n19 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nSome of the loans we service are higher risk loans, which are more expensive to service than conventional mortgage loans.\nSome of the mortgage loans we service are higher risk loans, meaning that the loans are to less credit worthy borrowers, delinquent or for properties the value of which has decreased. These loans are more expensive to service because they require more frequent interaction with customers and greater monitoring and oversight. Additionally, in connection with the ongoing mortgage market reform and regulatory developments, servicers of higher risk loans are subject to increased scrutiny by state and federal regulators and will experience higher compliance and regulatory costs, which could result in a further increase in servicing costs. We may not be able to pass along any of the additional expenses we incur in servicing higher risk loans to our servicing clients. The greater cost of servicing higher risk loans, which may be further increased through regulatory reform, consent decrees or enforcement, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to make servicing advances that can be subject to delays in recovery or may not be recoverable in certain circumstances.\nForward Mortgage Servicing Rights: During any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors. As home values change, we may have to reconsider certain of the assumptions underlying our decisions to make advances, and in certain situations our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition, when a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs.\nWe have sold to a joint venture capitalized by certain entities formed and managed by New Residential and certain third-party investors the rights to mortgage servicing rights and servicer advances related to certain loan pools. In connection with these transactions, New Residential purchased the equity of wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries of Mr. Cooper Group that issued limited recourse funding to finance the advances. We continue to service these loans. In the event that New Residential receives requests for advances in excess of amounts that they or their co-investors are willing or able to fund, we are obligated to fund these advance requests. Since we have transferred the related advance facilities to New Residential, we may have to obtain other sources of financing which may not be available. Our inability to fund these advances could result in a termination event under the applicable servicing agreement, an event of default under the advance facilities and a breach of our purchase agreement with New Residential. Our inability to fund these advance requests could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReverse Mortgages: As a reverse mortgage servicer, we are also responsible for funding draws due to borrowers in a timely manner, remitting to investors interest accrued and paying for interest shortfalls. Advances on reverse mortgages are typically greater than advances on forward residential mortgages. They are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from securitizations in the market. In the event we receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, we may not be able to fund these advance requests, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations. A delay in our ability to collect an advance may adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur counterparties may terminate our servicing rights and subservicing contracts.\nThe owners of the loans we service and the primary servicers of the loans we subservice may, under certain circumstances, terminate our MSRs or subservicing contracts, respectively.\nAgency Servicing: We are party to seller/servicer agreements and/or subject to guidelines and regulations (collectively, seller/servicer obligations) with both of the GSEs, FHA and Ginnie Mae. As is standard in the industry, under the terms of these seller/servicer agreements, the agencies have the right to terminate us as servicer of the loans we service on their behalf at any time and also have the right to cause us to sell the MSRs to a third party. These seller/servicer obligations include financial covenants that include capital requirements related to tangible net worth. To the extent that these capital requirements are not met, the applicable agency may suspend or terminate these agreements, which would prohibit us from further servicing these specific types of mortgage loans or being an approved servicer. If we are unable to meet these capital requirements, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 20\nSubservicing: Our subservicing portfolio is highly concentrated with a small number of parties who may elect to transfer their subservicing relationship to other counterparties or may go out of business. As of December 31, 2018, 96% of our subservicing portfolio is with four counterparties. Under our subservicing contracts, the primary servicers for which we conduct subservicing activities have the right to terminate our subservicing contracts with or without cause, with limited notice and with no termination fee upon a change of control. For example, we realized a decline in our subservicing portfolio of $47 billion in UPB in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the termination of a subservicing agreement when the servicer of record sold its ownership interest and the new owner did not retain us as subservicer. Entering into additional subservicing contracts will expose us to similar risks with new counterparties.\nIf our servicing rights or subservicing contracts are terminated on a material portion of our servicing portfolio, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe service reverse mortgages, which subjects us to additional risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. Loan defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to maintain their property, fail to pay taxes or home insurance premiums, die or fail to occupy their property for 12 consecutive months. Higher than anticipated foreclosures could result in increased losses. We use financial models that rely heavily on estimates to forecast loss exposure related to certain reverse mortgage assets and liabilities. These models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for mortality, interest rates and prepayments. In addition, the models use investor and state required time lines for certain default related activities. Even if the general accuracy of our loss models is validated, loss estimates are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. If these assumptions or relationships prove to be inaccurate or if market conditions change, the actual loss experience could be higher than modeled. Additionally, we could become subject to negative reputational risk in the event that loan defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or evictions of elderly homeowners.\nWe could have a downgrade in our servicer ratings.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch rate us as a residential loan servicer. Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing business. Downgrades in servicer ratings could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance servicing advances and maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and other investors;\n\u2022\nlead to the early termination of existing advance facilities and affect the terms and availability of advance facilities that we may seek in the future;\n\u2022\ncause our termination as servicer in our servicing agreements that require that we maintain specified servicer ratings; and\n\u2022\nfurther impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions.\nAny of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOriginations\nWe may not be able to maintain the volumes in our loan originations business, which would adversely affect our ability to replenish our servicing business.\nThe volume of loans funded within our loan originations business is subject to multiple factors, including changes in interest rates and availability of government programs. Volume in our originations business is based in large part on the refinancing of existing mortgage loans that we service, which is highly dependent on interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. Our loan origination volume may decline if interest rates increase, if government programs terminate and are not replaced with similar programs or if we cannot replace this volume with other loan origination channels such as Correspondent, new customer acquisitions or purchase money loans. If we are unable to maintain our loan originations volume, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n21 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may be required to indemnify or repurchase loans we sold, or will sell, if these loans fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances.\nThe indentures governing our securitized pools of loans and our contracts with purchasers of our whole loans contain provisions that require us to indemnify or repurchase the related loans under certain circumstances. While our contracts vary, they contain provisions that require us to repurchase loans if:\n\u2022\nour representations and warranties concerning loan quality and loan circumstances are inaccurate, including representations concerning the licensing of a mortgage broker;\n\u2022\nwe fail to secure adequate mortgage insurance within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage;\n\u2022\nwe fail to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in the current dynamic regulatory environment; or\n\u2022\nthe borrower fails to make certain initial loan payments due to the purchaser.\nWe are subject to repurchase claims and may continue to receive claims in the future. If we are required to indemnify or repurchase loans that we originate or have previously originated and sell or securitize that result in losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon loan programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the US Department of Agriculture and Ginnie Mae (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors.\nThere are various legislative and Trump administration proposals which deal with GSE reform, including winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of loans that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs is still in doubt.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the Agencies that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These Agencies play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with many of them. Almost all of the conforming loans we originate qualify under existing standards for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage securities backed by one of these Agencies. We also derive other material financial benefits from these relationships, including the assumption of credit risk on loans included in such mortgage securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. If it is not possible for us to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in Agency programs, we may lack liquidity under our mortgage financing facilities to continue to fund mortgage loans, and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these Agencies or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of these Agencies could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 22\nXome\nXome participates in highly competitive markets and pressure from existing and new companies could adversely affect Xome\u2019s businesses.\nThe markets for Xome\u2019s services are very competitive, and Xome\u2019s success depends on its ability to continue to attract additional customers, consumers and real estate professionals to its offerings including exchange, services, and data/technology. Any of Xome\u2019s future or existing competitors may introduce different products that provide solutions similar to our own but with either better user interfaces, branding and marketing resources, or at a lower price. In addition, the time and expense associated with switching from Xome\u2019s competitors\u2019 services and technologies to ours, and the reluctance of loan servicers or originators to add new vendors in light of declining revenues or economics in their sectors for the past 2 years may limit Xome\u2019s growth. If we are unable to continue to innovate and grow our market share or the number of end-users of Xome\u2019s offerings, we may not remain competitive or may face downward pricing pressures, and our business and financial performance could suffer. Furthermore, in the Business to Business area, Xome may not be able to attract and retain clients who view themselves as Mr. Cooper\u2019s competitors due to perceived conflict of interest concerns.\nXome may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert claims against Xome, asserting that Xome\u2019s content, website processes or software applications infringe their intellectual property rights. For example, Xome is currently a defendant in a proceeding where the plaintiff alleges that Xome misappropriated plaintiff\u2019s intellectual property for the purpose of replicating plaintiff\u2019s products. If any infringement claim is successful, Xome may be required to pay substantial damages, obtain a license from the third party or be prohibited from using content that incorporates the challenged intellectual property, which could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nXome is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels, and any failure to comply with existing or new regulations may adversely impact us, our clients and our results of operations.\nXome is subject to licensing and regulation as a real estate broker, auctioneer, appraisal management company, title agent and/or insurance agent in a number of states and may be subject to new licensing and regulation as it expands service offerings. Xome is subject to audits and examinations that are conducted by federal and state regulatory authorities and, as a vendor, is also subject to similar audit requirements imposed on its clients, including us. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by various state licensing authorities for the particular type of service provided and to participate in regular background checks, fingerprinting requirements and continuing education programs. We may incur significant ongoing costs to comply with governmental regulations, and new laws and regulations may be adopted that prohibit us from engaging Xome as a vendor, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nXome\u2019s revenue from clients in the mortgage and real estate industries is affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions.\nReal estate markets are subject to fluctuations, due to factors such as the relative relationship of supply to demand, the availability of alternative investment products, the unemployment rate, real wage increases, inflation and the general economic environment. An economic slowdown or recession, in addition to other non-economic factors such as an excess supply in properties, a change in consumer preferences towards rental properties or declining consumer confidence in the economy, could have a material adverse effect on values of residential real estate properties. The volume of mortgage origination, mortgage refinancing and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. The level of real estate transactions is primarily affected by the average price of real estate sales, the availability of funds to finance purchases, mortgage interest rates, consumer confidence in the economy and general economic factors affecting the real estate markets. Reductions in these transaction volumes could have a material adverse effect on Xome\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could have, appear to have or be alleged to have conflicts of interest with Xome.\nXome provides services to us which could create, appear to create or be alleged to create conflicts of interest. By obtaining services from a subsidiary, there is risk of possible claims of collusion or claims that such services are not provided by Xome upon market terms. We have adopted policies, procedures and practices, and engage and procedures that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest. In addition, we undertake practices to identify and deal with potential or actual conflicts. Further, we have engaged an independent third party to conduct a pricing study in an attempt to ensure that the fees charged are customary and reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in eliminating all conflicts of interest or that third parties will refrain from making such allegations. Appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of counterparties to enter into transactions with us may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\n23 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nStrategic\nWe may not be successful in implementing certain strategic initiatives.\nCertain strategic initiatives, which are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term stockholder value, include:\n\u2022\nattracting new customers through our purchase money loan originations channel which will require expanded products, technologies, teams and multi-channel marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nfocusing on originations product expansion and profitable new growth platforms;\n\u2022\nincreasing third-party business at Xome;\n\u2022\nintegrating Assurant Mortgage Solutions into Xome;\n\u2022\nincreasing efficiencies while improving the customer experience; and\n\u2022\nbalancing disciplined UPB growth while meeting and delivering target unit economics.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives, that we will be able to realize all of the projected benefits of our plans or that we will be able to compete successfully in new markets and our efforts may be more expensive and time consuming than we expect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Risks\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks against us or our vendors could damage our business operations, and new laws and regulations could increase our costs.\nThe financial services industry as a whole is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, and system disruptions and failures caused by fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, system misuse, unauthorized intrusion (cyber-attack), computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters and other similar events may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our borrowers. As a part of conducting business, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. Additionally, Xome is highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store sensitive electronic information. Cybersecurity risks for the financial services industry have increased significantly in recent years due to new technologies, the reliance on technology to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. Those parties also may attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to obtain loans or other financial products from us or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. We and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems, and data, or to obtain, change, or destroy confidential data (including personal identifying information of individuals) through a variety of means, including computer viruses, malware, phishing and other attack vectors. These attacks may result in unauthorized individuals obtaining access to our confidential information or that of our customers, or otherwise accessing, damaging, or disrupting our systems or infrastructure. In addition, to access our products and services, including our Home Intelligence app, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations could also be sources of operational risk and information security risk to us, including from cyber-attacks, information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the performance of their responsibilities. Security breaches, acts of vandalism and developments in computer intrusion capabilities could cause our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities to fail to operate properly or become disabled and could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we or our vendors use to protect our borrowers\u2019 personal information and transaction data.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all internal and external security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently, are becoming more sophisticated and are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our reliance on telecommunication technologies (including mobile devices), the internet and use of web-based product offerings.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 24\nWhile we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, there can be no assurance that any such cyber intrusions, whether external or internal, will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or a defect in the integrity of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or cybersecurity could cause serious negative consequences for our business, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or operating systems and to those of our customers and counterparties. Any of the foregoing events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we have obtained insurance to cover us against certain cybersecurity risks and information theft, there can be no guarantee that all losses will be covered or that the insurance limits will be sufficient to cover such losses.\nIn addition, increasing attention is being paid by the media, regulators and legislators to matters relating to cybersecurity, and regulators and legislators may enact laws or regulations regarding cybersecurity. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services has adopted regulations that are far-ranging in scope, including not only specific technical safeguards but also requirements regarding governance, incident planning, data management and system testing. New laws and regulations could result in significant compliance costs, which may adversely affect our cash flows and net income.\nOur capital investments in technology may not achieve anticipated returns.\nOur business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments, and the returns on these investments are less predictable. We are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to support our service offering, implement improvements to our customer-facing technology and evolve our information processes, and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our customers. These technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. Failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs, could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our vendors have operations in India and/or the Philippines that could be adversely affected by changes in political or economic stability or by government policies.\nWe, including Xome, currently have operations located in India, and we have reduced our costs by contracting with certain third parties with operations in India and in the Philippines. These countries are subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. The political or regulatory climate in the United States, or elsewhere, also could change so that it would not be lawful or practical for us to use international operations in the manner in which we currently use them. If we or our vendors had to curtail or cease operations in these countries and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we would incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). Any violations of the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe have significant vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our businesses. With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by the applicable servicing criteria, we assess compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor (or in certain cases require vendors to provide their own assessments and attestations) and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor\u2019s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our servicing agreements. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n25 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, regulatory, legal and reputational risk. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract, or retain, highly skilled employees and changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. Trained and experienced personnel in the mortgage industry are in high demand and may be in short supply. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees are large banks who have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. We may not be able to attract, develop and maintain an adequate skilled workforce necessary to operate our businesses and labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of qualified personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such personnel, we may not be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other growth opportunities that may be presented to us and this could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the experience of our executive management team is a valuable asset to us. Our executive management team has significant experience in the residential loan originations and servicing industry and would be difficult to replace. Disruptions in management continuity could result in operational or administrative inefficiencies and added costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and stock price, and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult or costly.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending and debt collection practices, foreclosures or evictions of elderly homeowners who default on reverse mortgages, technology failures, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Additionally, the proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, trading counterparties and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance. Similarly, we may experience a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to spend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate within a highly regulated industry on a federal, state and local levels and our business results are significantly impacted by the laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as scrutiny from governmental or regulatory agencies.\nAs a national mortgage services firm, we are subject to extensive, complex and comprehensive regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States, as well as governmental scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement agencies. These laws, regulations and governmental inquiries can significantly affect the way that we do business, can restrict the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to expand our product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make our costs to service or originate loans higher, which could impact our financial results.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26\nRegulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) or other federal or state agencies, including HUD and the FCC, may promulgate could require changes in our business, result in increased compliance and operational costs and impair the profitability of such business. For example, the CFPB adopted rules effective in August 2017 and April 2018 regarding mortgage servicing practices which required significant modifications and enhancements to our mortgage servicing processes and systems. Additionally, the CFPB issued a rule, effective in January 2018, amending Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\u201cHMDA\u201d) that greatly expands the scope of data required to be collected and reported for every loan application from approximately 23 to 48 data elements. These new requirements for gathering and submitting large amounts of data regarding loan applications to regulators and the public is complex. Thus, any inadvertent errors in our gathering or reporting the data could result in fines or penalties being levied by the CFPB or other regulators against us. In addition, the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), could be expanded and we could be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. The cumulative effect of these changes could result in a material impact on our earnings. The implementation of the originations and servicing rules by the CFPB and the CFPB\u2019s continuing examinations of our business, including Xome, could increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs and place restrictions on our operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to additional regulatory requirements or changes under the Dodd-Frank Act beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated. There also continues to be discussion of potential GSE reform which would likely affect markets for mortgages and mortgage securities in ways that cannot be predicted. In addition, FHFA initiatives may be implemented by the GSEs that could materially affect the market for conventional and/or government insured loans.\nIn addition, under the Trump Administration, a level of heightened uncertainty exists with respect to the future of the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB. We cannot predict the specific legislative or executive actions that may result or what actions state regulators or enforcement agencies might take in response to changes to the federal regulatory environment. Such actions could impact the industry generally, could impact our relationships with other regulators and could limit our ability to reach acceptable resolution with the CFPB or other regulatory or enforcement agencies on outstanding investigations, examinations or reviews. Any changes in our current regulatory environment could create uncertainty and result in increasing legal and compliance costs.\nIndividual states have also been active, as have other regulatory organizations such as the Multi-State Mortgage Committee, as well as various state Attorneys General. We also believe there has been a shift among certain regulators towards a broader view of the scope of regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to mortgage originators and servicers. In addition to their traditional focus on consumer protection laws, licensing and examination matters, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to such areas as corporate governance, safety and soundness, and risk and compliance management.\nCertain regulators took steps to block the acquisition of MSRs by one of our competitors. It is possible that we could become subject to similar actions with respect to our acquisition of MSRs or other key business operations such as entering into subservicing contracts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n27 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe are subject to numerous legal proceedings, federal, state or local governmental examinations and enforcement investigations. Some of these matters are highly complex and slow to develop, and results are difficult to predict or estimate.\nLegal Proceedings: We are routinely and currently involved in a significant number of legal proceedings concerning matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There is no assurance that the number of legal proceedings will not increase in the future, including certified class or mass actions. These legal proceedings range from actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially tens of thousands of class members. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment, contract, tort, common law fraud and numerous other laws, including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, National Housing Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Servicemember\u2019s Civil Relief Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in violation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bankruptcy Code, False Claims Act and Making Home Affordable loan modification programs (while MHA programs have ended, claims may continue to arise). Additionally, along with others in our industry, we are subject to repurchase and indemnification claims and may continue to receive claims in the future, regarding alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to the sale of mortgage loans, the placement of mortgage loans into securitization trusts or the servicing of mortgage loans securitizations. We are also subject to legal actions or proceedings related to loss sharing and indemnification provisions of our various acquisitions. Certain of the pending or threatened legal proceedings include claims for substantial compensatory, punitive and/or, statutory damages or claims for an indeterminate amount of damages.\nLitigation and other proceedings may require that we pay settlement costs, legal fees, damages, including punitive damages, penalties or other charges, or be subject to injunctive relief affecting our business practices, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, ongoing and other legal proceedings brought under federal or state consumer protection statutes may result in a separate fine for each violation of the statute, which, particularly in the case of class action lawsuits, could result in damages substantially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities and that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. The costs of responding to the investigations can be substantial.\nRegulatory Matters: Our business is subject to extensive examinations, investigations and reviews by various federal, state and local governmental, regulatory and enforcement agencies. We have historically had and continue to have a number of open investigations with these agencies. We are currently the subject of various governmental or regulatory investigations, subpoenas, examinations and inquiries related to our residential loan servicing and origination practices, bankruptcy and collections practices, our financial reporting and other aspects of our businesses. These matters include investigations by the CFPB, the SEC, the Executive Office of the United States Trustees, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the multistate coalition of mortgage banking regulators, and various State Attorneys General. Several large mortgage originators or servicers have been subject to similar matters, which have resulted in the payment of fines and penalties, changes to business practices and the entry of consent decrees or settlements. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, including us. We continue to manage our response to each matter, but it is not possible for us to confidently or reliably predict the outcome of any of them, including predicting any possible losses resulting from any judgments or fines, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent settlements or penalties.\nWe continue to progress towards resolution of certain legacy regulatory matters involving examination findings in prior years for alleged violations of certain laws related to our business practices. We have been in discussions with the multi-state committee of mortgage banking regulators and various State Attorneys General concerning a potential resolution of their investigation. We are continuing to cooperate with all parties. In connection with these discussions, the Company previously recorded an accrual. These discussions may not result in a settlement of the matter; furthermore, any such settlement may exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2018. Moreover, if the discussions do not result in a settlement, the regulators and State Attorneys General may seek to exercise their enforcement authority through litigation or other proceedings and seek injunctive relief, damages, restitution and civil monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28\nFurther, on April 24, 2018, the CFPB notified us that, in accordance with the CFPB\u2019s discretionary Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (\u201cNORA\u201d) process, the CFPB\u2019s Office of Enforcement is considering whether to recommend that the CFPB take enforcement action against us, alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act, and the Homeowners Protection Act, which stems from a 2014 examination. The purpose of a NORA letter is to provide a party being investigated an opportunity to present its position to the CFPB before an enforcement action may be recommended or commenced. The CFPB may seek to exercise its enforcement authority through settlement, administrative proceedings or litigation and seek injunctive relief, damages, restitution and civil monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, while we are in discussions with regard to the status and various issues arising in the investigation by the Executive Office of the United States Trustees, we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation or whether they will exercise their enforcement authority through a settlement or other proceeding in which they seek to impose additional remedial measures or other financial sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operation.\nResponding to these matters requires us to devote substantial legal and regulatory resources, resulting in higher costs and lower net cash flows. Adverse results in any of these matters could further increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, require us to change business practices, limit our ability to grow and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operation. To the extent that an examination or other regulatory engagement reveals a failure by us to comply with applicable law, regulation or licensing requirement this could lead to (i) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our businesses, (ii) damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of client relationships, (iii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iv) administrative fines and penalties and litigation, (v) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits, and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities, (vi) enhanced compliance requirements, (vii) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (viii) inability to raise capital and (ix) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these occurrences could further increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, require us to change business practices and procedures and limit our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operation.\nMoreover, regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, other regulatory changes such as the CFPB having its own examination and enforcement authority and the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and guidance on whistleblowing programs issued by the NYDFS could further increase the number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings against us. In addition, while we take numerous steps to prevent and detect employee misconduct, such as fraud, employee misconduct cannot always be deterred or prevented and could subject us to additional liability.\nWe establish reserves for pending or threatened legal proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and our estimates of loss are based on judgments and information available at that time. Our estimates may change from time to time for various reasons, including factual or legal developments in these matters. There cannot be any assurance that the ultimate resolution of our litigation and regulatory matters will not involve losses, which may be material, in excess of our recorded accruals or estimates of reasonably probable losses.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in the mortgage industry.\nFederal, state and local governments have recently proposed or enacted numerous laws, regulations and rules related to mortgage loans. Due to the highly regulated nature of the residential mortgage industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our servicing, originations and ancillary business and the fees we may charge. These regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, which includes enhancing our compliance program, procedures and controls, monitoring and internal and external audits. A failure in maintaining an effective compliance program or a material failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could subject us to lawsuits or governmental actions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there continue to be changes in legislation and licensing, which require technology changes and additional implementation costs for loan originators. We expect legislative changes will continue in the foreseeable future, which may increase our operating expenses.\nFurthermore, there continue to be changes in state laws that are adverse to mortgage servicers that increase costs and operational complexity of our business and impose significant penalties for violation. Any of these changes in law could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nUnlike competitors that are national banks, we are subject to state licensing and operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs.\nBecause we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from a federal exemption to state mortgage banking, loan servicing or debt collection licensing and regulatory requirements. We must comply with state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and we are sensitive to regulatory changes that may increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws or increased fees or that may impose conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. In addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulators, which can result in refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by state regulators due to compliance errors. Future state legislation and changes in existing regulation may significantly increase our compliance costs or reduce the amount of ancillary revenues, including late fees that we may charge to borrowers. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially affect our business.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we lose our licenses.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to mortgage servicing companies and mortgage originations companies such as us as well as regulating our ancillary service providers. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a mortgage servicing company, mortgage originations company or third-party debt default specialist, title insurance agency, appraisal management company, licensed auctioneer, and other similar types of requirements as to the form and content of contracts and other documentation, licensing of our employees and employee hiring background checks, licensing of independent contractors with which we contract, restrictions on certain practices, disclosure and record-keeping requirements and enforcement of borrowers\u2019 rights. We are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities.\nWe believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing or other agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. The states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our businesses may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, the adoption of additional, or the revision of existing, rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur increased litigation costs and related losses if a court overturns a foreclosure or if a loan we are servicing becomes subordinate to a Home Owners Association lien.\nWe may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. In addition, if a court rules that the lien of a Homeowners Association takes priority over the lien we service, we may incur legal liabilities and costs to defend such actions. If a court dismisses or overturns a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the loan owner, a borrower, title insurer or the purchaser of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. A significant increase in litigation costs could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResidential mortgage foreclosure proceedings in certain states have been delayed due to lack of judicial resources and legislation, all of which could have a negative effect on our ability to liquidate loans timely and slow the recovery of advances and thus impact our earnings or liquidity.\nIn some states, such as New York, our industry has faced, and may continue to face, increased delays and costs caused by state law and local court rules and processes. In addition, California and Nevada have enacted Homeowner\u2019s Bill of Rights legislation to establish complex mandatory loss mitigation practices for homeowners which cause delays in foreclosure proceedings. Delays in foreclosure proceedings could also require us to make additional servicing advances by drawing on our servicing advance facilities, or delay the recovery of advances, all or any of which could materially affect our earnings and liquidity and increase our need for capital.\nRisks Related to the Owning our Stock\nOur common stock, and any other instruments treated as stock for purposes of Section 382, including the Series A Preferred Stock, are subject to transfer restrictions under our Certificate of Incorporation which, if not complied with, could result in the forfeiture of such stock and related distributions.\nMr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 30\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains significant transfer restrictions in relation to the transfer of our common stock and any other instruments treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 (including the Series A Preferred Stock). These transfer restrictions have been adopted in order to minimize the likelihood that we will be deemed to have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 that could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs under and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the IRS.\nIn particular, without the approval of our Board, (i) no person or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 will be permitted to acquire, whether directly or indirectly, and whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any of our common stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382, to the extent that after giving effect to such purported acquisition (a) the purported acquirer or any other person by reason of the purported acquirer\u2019s acquisition would become a Substantial Holder (as defined below), or (b) the percentage stock ownership of a person that, prior to giving effect to the purported acquisition, is already a Substantial Holder would be increased; and (ii) no Substantial Holder may dispose, directly or indirectly, of any class of stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382. A \u201cSubstantial Holder\u201d is a person that owns (as determined for purposes of Section 382) at least 4.75% of the total value of our stock, including any instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382.\nBecause of the complexity of applying Section 382, and because the determination of ownership for purposes of Section 382 does not correspond to SEC beneficial ownership reporting on Schedules 13D and 13G, holders and potential acquirers of our securities should consult with their legal and tax advisors prior to making any acquisition or disposition of our securities. Pursuant to Article VIII of our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board has the sole power to determine compliance with the transfer restrictions, and we cannot assure you that the Board will concur with any conclusions reached by any holder of our securities or their respective advisors, and/or approve or ratify any proposed acquisitions or dispositions of our securities. Under Article VIII, Section 3(b), of our Certificate of Incorporation, if the Board determines that a Prohibited Transfer (as defined in our Certificate of Incorporation) has occurred, such Prohibited Transfer shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be void ab initio and have no legal effect, and upon written demand by us, the Purported Transferee (as defined in our Certificate of Incorporation) shall disgorge or cause to be disgorged our securities, together with any dividends or distributions received, with respect to such securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) and under Delaware law, as well as certain existing contractual arrangements, make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, including Article VIII thereof, and Bylaws, as well as certain contractual arrangements with KKR, contain provisions that make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by or stockholders. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nAffiliates of KKR own a substantial amount of equity interests in us, and have other substantial interests in us and agreements with us, and may have conflicts of interest with us or the other holders of our capital stock.\nAs of February 15, 2019, affiliates of KKR held shares of our stock representing approximately 17% of our voting power on an as-converted basis. Affiliates of KKR are parties to the Investment Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement. As a result, affiliates of KKR may have substantial influence over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction, including with respect to any acquisition, and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether other holders of our capital stock believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. KKR will not provide oversight of or have control over or be involved with the investment activities or other operations of the Company.\nNeither KKR nor its director appointees are required to present us with investment opportunities and may pursue them separately or otherwise compete with us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest or expectancy in any corporate opportunity in which KKR or its director appointees seek to participate unless such opportunity (i) was first presented to KKR\u2019s director appointees solely in their capacity as directors of the Company or (ii) is identified by KKR or its director appointees solely through the disclosure of information by or on behalf of us.\nAdditionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or that compete with us for acquisitions. KKR may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, KKR\u2019s interest in its portfolio companies could impact our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities.\nThe market price of our common stock may decrease, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock could decrease, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which your shares were acquired. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors, including:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of our competitors and fluctuations in our operating results;\n31 Mr. Cooper Group Inc. - 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\u2022\nmacro economic trends, including changes in interest rates and economic growth and unemployment;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nglobal, national or local economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of negative news by us or our competitors, such as announcements of poorer than expected results of operations, data breaches or significant litigation;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results, and our or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance we or our competitors may give the market;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares publicly traded;\n\u2022\nthe converted Series B preferred stockholders selling their shares; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may cause declines in the market price of our common stock, and you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 81593, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "COOP"}
