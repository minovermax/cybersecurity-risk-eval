{"cik": "914577", "company": "TRANS WORLD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe have described below what we currently believe to be the material risks and uncertainties in our business.\nBefore making an investment decision with respect to our Common Stock, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also face other risks and uncertainties beyond what is described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Further, past financial performance may not be a reliable indication of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our Common Stock could decline significantly. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nRegulation and licensing\nOur gambling operations are subject to regulation by each federal and local jurisdiction in which we operate. Each of our officers may be subject to strict scrutiny and approval from the gaming commission or other regulatory body of each jurisdiction in which we conduct gambling operations. Furthermore, the operations of our casinos are contingent upon maintaining all necessary regulatory licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations. The laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals generally relate to the operations of the casinos, the payment of taxes, the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gambling operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gambling operations. All of our casinos are duly licensed by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (the \u201cMOF\u201d), and we are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain these operations.\nCzech regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approval and to approve changes in our operations. The suspension or revocation of any license which may be granted to us could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any change in the laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures or could otherwise negatively affect our gambling operations.\nPotential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations\nLaws and regulations governing the conduct of gambling activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gambling operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nMoreover, legislation to prohibit, limit, or burden our gambling business may be introduced in the future in the Czech Republic or elsewhere where gambling has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups (which may include our competitors) have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gambling operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gambling or restriction on or prohibition of our gambling operations, increase in gaming taxes, or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nGaming legislation is introduced in the Czech Parliament from time to time. In October 2014, the MOF, the national governmental authority that regulates gambling in the Czech Republic, introduced proposed legislation that would, if approved, among other things, limit the number of gambling establishments, limit the number of slot machines, shorten license periods, require security bonds for each casino operation by location, limit betting amounts and the amount of losses per hour and per month permitted for players, limit the duration of each individual\u2019s playtime and the pace of certain live games, prohibit the serving of complimentary food, beverage or cigarettes, link slot machines to an MOF database, create an online database of gamblers that is linked to the MOF, and give local municipalities more power over gambling establishments.\nIn addition to the 2016 Gaming Tax Amendment that became effective on December 28, 2015 for the calendar year 2016 and forward, the MOF has also stated publicly that it is also contemplating the introduction of an additional tax law that could further increase gaming tax rates. The draft law, which is currently under committee review in the Czech parliament, is open to comment by interested parties, review by other government agencies, and review by the European Union. The proposed legislation is also subject to parliamentary procedure that could include amendments that could materially change the proposal, and amendment and/or ratification in the Czech Senate, all of which could occur in 2016. Because the parameters and effects of this proposed legislation are still speculative, at this point in time, the Company cannot predict what the ultimate statute will contain, whether it will be passed in the Czech Parliament, or whether it will be signed by the Czech President. Therefore, we cannot, as of the date of this report, specifically predict any proposed legislation or its effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. However, if any or all of this proposed legislation is adopted in its current form, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and business prospects.\nTaxation of gambling operations\nGambling operators are typically subject to significant taxes, which may increase at any time. Material increases in these taxes or fees would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The Czech Republic currently has a number of laws related to various taxes imposed by governmental authorities. Applicable taxes include VAT, gaming tax, corporate income tax, and payroll (social) taxes. In December 2011, the Czech government passed sweeping gaming tax legislation that became effective in 2012. In this new tax law, the government eliminated the \u201ccharity contribution tax\u201d scheme and, in lieu of it, changed the existing revenue-based, tiered rate gaming tax structure to a flat 20% gaming tax on all gambling revenues, plus an applicable corporate income tax of 19% on adjusted net income derived from any revenue sources, including gambling. These tax law changes have negatively and materially impacted our results of operations since 2012.\nIn December 2015, the Czech government passed an amendment to the gaming tax law which effectively and significantly raised the gaming tax rates. The amendment is effective for the calendar year 2016 and forward. See also \u201cGaming Tax\u201d section under \u201cTaxation\u201d above. These tax law changes, together with other legal compliance areas (for example, customs and currency control matters) are subject to review and investigation by a number of different Czech governmental authorities, which are authorized by law to impose fines, penalties and interest charges. These reviews may create additional tax risks that, if applied to TWC, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nGeneral economic trends are unfavorable\nThe recent worldwide economic downturn in 2009 and the anemic economic growth that followed as well as the current debt and immigrant crises in the EU, had, and may, in the future, continue to have a negative impact on our financial performance. Lingering adverse conditions in local, regional, national and global markets could negatively impact our operations in the future. During periods of economic contraction like that recently experienced, certain costs can remain fixed or even increase, while revenues decline. The gambling services we provide are similar to other leisure activities in that they depend on personal discretionary expenditures, which are likely to decline during economic downturns. Continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, and particularly in Europe, including a general tightening of the availability of credit, unemployment, deflation, political or economic turmoil, government debt crises, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence or significant declines in world stock markets could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities. We cannot predict at this time what the full effect and extent of a possible global recession and the subsequent extended period of slow-growth in Europe will be on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe face significant competition\nWe operate in the highly competitive gaming industry with a large number of participants, many of which have financial and other resources that are greater than ours. The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options, as well as home entertainment alternatives. Competitive gambling activities include traditional casinos, video lottery terminals, internet gaming, sports betting, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and in other jurisdictions. Moreover, these established gambling jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gambling operations. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our operations, such gaming opportunities could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, internet gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and is affecting competition in our industry. Web-based businesses may offer consumers a wide variety of events to wager on, including other games, racetracks and sporting events. Unlike most web-based gaming companies, we pay taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and our operations require ongoing capital expenditures for both their continued smooth operations, maintenance, renovation and growth. We could also face significantly greater costs in operating our business compared to these \u201cvirtual\u201d internet gaming companies. We cannot offer the same number of gaming options as internet-based gaming companies. Many internet-based gaming companies are located off-shore and avoid regulation under applicable Czech laws. These companies may divert wagering dollars from live wagering venues, such as our casinos. The continued\ngrowth and success of these on-line ventures could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur principal hotel competitors are other operators of full-service and select-service properties, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against smaller hotel chains and privately owned hotels. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues or profits may decline or our ability to maintain or increase our market share may be diminished. We compete for guests based primarily on location, customer satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, and quality of accommodations. Most of our competitors are larger than we are, based on the number of properties they manage, franchise or own, or based on the number of rooms or geographic locations where they operate. Many of our competitors also have recognizable brands, participate with online travel merchants and have a large number of members participating in their guest loyalty programs which may enable them to attract more customers and more effectively retain such guests. Our competitors generally also have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business\nOur facilities in the Czech Republic represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated is generally denominated in EUR and the expenses incurred by these facilities are largely denominated in CZK, while revenues and expenses from our two hotels in Germany are denominated in EUR. The potential depreciation in the value of either of these currencies against the USD would adversely impact the revenue and operating profit from our operations when translated into USD, which would have a corresponding effect on our consolidated results of operations. (See also \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\u201d). We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations of these foreign currencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge any future foreign currency exposure, if we subsequently choose to do so in the future.\nWe are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry\nOur hotel segment is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and cost of capital necessary for us to fund acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in or cancellations of planned or future acquisition or development projects;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating costs, including, but not limited to, energy, food, workers\u2019 compensation, benefits, insurance and unanticipated costs resulting from statutory requirements and/or force majeure events;\n\u00b7\nincreases in cost for healthcare coverage for employees and potential government regulation in respect of health coverage;\n\u00b7\nshortages of labor or labor disruptions;\n\u00b7\nshortages of desirable locations for acquisition or development;\n\u00b7\nunrealistic purchase prices set by sellers; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third-party internet travel intermediaries to attract customers for our properties.\nAny of these factors could limit or reduce the prices we charge for our hospitality products or services, including the rates our properties charge for accommodations. These factors can also increase our costs or affect our ability to develop or acquire new properties or maintain and operate our existing properties. As a result, any of these factors can reduce our profits and limit our opportunities for growth.\nNeed to diversify\nPrior to 2014, all of our operations were primarily located in the Czech Republic. Therefore, any future adverse legislation in the Czech Republic may have an adverse impact on our Czech operations, financial results, financial\ncondition and prospects. To counteract this risk, we acquired the Hotel Columbus in Seligenstadt, Germany, in September 2014 and, in June 2015, the Hotel Freizeit Auefeld in Hann. M\u00fcnden, Germany. We have earmarked a sizable portion of the Company\u2019s cash reserves for expansion and are currently seeking to develop and/or acquire additional interests in gambling operations and/or hotels in other European countries. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire such new operations in the future.\nNeed for additional financing\nAlthough we have achieved net income for the thirteenth consecutive year, pursuant to our growth strategies, we may require additional debt and/or equity financing for the acquisition and development of new businesses or business units. We may also need to access the capital markets or otherwise obtain additional funds to finance acquisitions, the continuing maintenance, renovation, or re-theming of currently owned facilities or the development of new operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such financing or funds in the future on favorable terms to us, or at all.\nDependence upon key personnel\nOur ability to successfully implement our strategy of expansion, manage the existing casinos, and maintain a competitive position will continue to depend, in large part, on the ability of Mr. Rami S. Ramadan, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), and Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d). The Company is also dependent upon other key employees, casino managers, and consultants, whom we retain from time to time.\nInternational activities\nOur operations are completely outside of the United States. Operating internationally involves additional risks including, but not limited to currency exchange rates, different legal or regulatory environments, political and economic risks relating to the stability or predictability of foreign governments, differences in the manner in which different cultures do business, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, differences in financial reporting, operating difficulties, terrorism, different types of criminal threats and other factors. The occurrence of any of these risks, if severe enough, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate impact\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical or electrical or telecommunications failure, traffic and road conditions, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, wind, snow, ice or other severe weather conditions. As the majority of our casino clientele travel from German and Austrian border regions by automobile, we are highly dependent on the volume and frequency of these players\u2019 visitations. Inclement weather conditions on the roads to our casinos can serve to substantially reduce the number of visitations, which occurred in the first and second quarter of 2013. On the other hand, warm and favorable outdoor weather can also divert players to alternative activities, such as family outings. The frequency and strength of any of these aforementioned climate conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nLiability insurance\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic property or casualty loss. We may also suffer disruption of our business in the event of a terrorist attack (at our premises or elsewhere), or other catastrophic property or casualty loss, or be subject to claims by third parties injured or harmed while visiting our locations. While we currently carry adequate general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses in such event.\nNo dividends\nWe have not paid any dividends to date on our Common Stock. Currently, our plan is to retain future earnings, if and when generated, for investment in our current operations and for future project developments. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of TWC\u2019s Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d) and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments and\nsuch other factors as our Board deems relevant. See the \u201cDividend\u201d section of Item 5. \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividends.\u201d\nDilutive effect of options, warrants, restricted stock and deferred stock compensation\nAs of February 29, 2016, there were options outstanding to purchase 665,000 shares of our Common Stock, plus 436,842 shares issuable under the Company\u2019s Deferred Compensation Plan and 75,000 shares of performance-tied restricted stock, which, if all were vested and exercised, would represent 11.8% of the 10,005,853 fully-diluted shares outstanding as of such date. The issuance of such securities would have a dilutive effect on any earnings per share that we may generate when the earnings per share are evaluated on a fully-diluted basis.\nPossible adverse effect of issuance of preferred stock\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 4,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with designations, rights and preferences to be determined from time to time by our Board. Accordingly, our Board is empowered, without further stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the dividend rights and/or voting power or other rights of the holders of the Common Stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Our Board has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. However, there can be no assurance that preferred stock will not be issued at some time in the future.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of the Company\u2019s privacy and security policies with respect to such information\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personally-identifiable, financial and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of customer identity and credit and payment card information. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and under increasing attack by cyber-criminals in the U.S. and Europe. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee or our corporate data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation, business integrity, and ultimately, our business prospects, and could result in fines, litigation or regulatory action against us.", "PERMNO": 81158, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "TWOC"}
