If any of the following risks and uncertainties should occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. Many of the following risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. Additionally, we note that we have accrued net losses annually since inception given the stage of our drug development. We urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development.\nRisks Related to Our Discovery, Development, and Commercialization of Medicines\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other public health epidemics.\nOur business and its operations, including but not limited to our research and development activities and our supply chain, could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have business operations, and such health epidemics could cause significant disruption in the operations of third parties upon whom we rely. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to public health directives and orders related to COVID-19, we implemented work-from-home policies for substantially all of our employees to the extent work can be performed effectively at home. The effects of executive and similar government orders, shelter-in-place orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact our productivity, disrupt our business, increase our expenses, including costs associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, companies with which we conduct business, and governments are taking, and delay our clinical trials and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place, executive and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions, including vaccination requirements or mandates, on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, have impacted and may continue to impact personnel at our business partners in the United States and other countries, or our access to raw materials for our research and development facility discovery efforts, which would disrupt our supply chain.\nIn addition, our clinical trials and preclinical programs have been and continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced delays in our earlier stage programs due to a shortage in non-human primates which are critical for our preclinical programs. Additionally, we have experienced delays in enrollment in our clinical trials.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s operations at its research and development facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and San Diego, California, as well as its corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California have continued to operate with limited impact, other than for enhanced safety measures, including work from home policies. However, the Company cannot predict the impact that the progression of COVID-19 will have on future financial results due to a variety of factors including the ability of the Company\u2019s clinical sites to continue to enroll subjects, the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to continue to operate, the continued good health and safety of the Company\u2019s employees, and ultimately the length of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn may be impacted by the efficacy, distribution and public acceptance of vaccines and treatments. If COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States and elsewhere, including as a result of mutations or variants, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in receiving authorization from local regulatory authorities to initiate any planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ndelays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials, including interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022\nchanges in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring and data entry and verification, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the completeness and integrity of clinical trial data and, as a result, the determine the outcomes of the trial;\n\u2022\nrisk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u2022\nrisk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will not be able to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from COVID-19;\n\u2022\nrisk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at our research and development laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\ndelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources, forced furlough of government employees or diversion of government resources to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nlimitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays to our clinical activities.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the long-term economic impact brought by COVID-19, and the duration of such impact, may be difficult to assess or predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our future liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 and related government orders and restrictions could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health emergency is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems, or the global economy as a whole. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize our new drugs, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use.\nOur research and development efforts involve therapeutics based on RNA interference and our delivery systems, which are largely unproven technologies. Our scientists and engineers are working on developing technology in the early stages. However, such technology\u2019s commercial feasibility and acceptance are unknown. Scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability if it can be achieved at all. To date, our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable drugs and may never do so. During the research and development process, we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome. Because we use platform technology to develop drug candidates, toxicology signals that may emerge in the course of testing of one particular candidate may apply broadly across our drug candidate platform. Further, certain underlying premises in our development programs are not proven and many of the drug targets that we are pursuing have not yet been validated clinically. For instance, the reduction of the production of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver may not lead to a reduction of globules in the liver, and even if it leads to a reduction in such globules, this may not lead to other beneficial hepatic changes. It is also unknown at this time what changes in the liver may be required to gain regulatory approval and/or favorable reimbursement for a drug that reduces the production of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver. Similar uncertainties and risks exist that are specific to each of our development programs. Because of these and similar uncertainties, it is possible that no commercial products will be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop commercial products, we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business.\nThere can be no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval.\nThe sale of human therapeutic products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is subject to extensive and time consuming regulatory approval which requires, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontrolled research and human clinical testing;\n\u2022\nestablishment of the safety and efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\ngovernment review and approval of a submission containing manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical data; and\n\u2022\nadherence to cGMP regulations during production and storage.\nThe product candidates we currently have under development will require significant development, pre-clinical and clinical testing and investment of significant funds to gain regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. The results of our research and human clinical testing of our products may not meet regulatory requirements. Some of our product candidates, if approved, will require the completion of post-market studies. There can be no assurance that any of our products will be further developed and approved. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining required approvals will take a number of years and require the use of substantial resources. Further, there can be no assurance that product candidates employing a new technology will be shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials or receive applicable regulatory approvals. If we fail to obtain regulatory approvals for any or all of our products, we will not be able to market such product and our operations may be adversely affected.\nIf testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results, then we will be unable to commercialize that product candidate.\nWe must demonstrate our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy in humans through extensive clinical testing. Our research and development programs are at an early stage of development. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of any products, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe results of pre-clinical studies may be inconclusive, or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials;\n\u2022\nafter reviewing test results, we may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising;\n\u2022\nwe or our regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials because the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved.\nTopline data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.\nWe may publicly disclose topline or interim data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data such as the data reported from the AROAAT2002, AROANG31001, and AROAPOC31001 clinical studies which are based on preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular drug candidate or drug and our company in general. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from a future analysis of results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.\nIt may take us longer than we project to complete clinical trials, and we may not be able to complete them at all.\nAlthough for planning purposes, we project the commencement, continuation and completion of our clinical trials, a number of factors, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and difficulties in identifying or enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, may cause significant delays. Enrollment of clinical trials may be particularly difficult in orphan diseases or limited-sized patient populations. The FDA or other regulatory bodies may require additional, longer or broader clinical trials to establish safety and effectiveness, notwithstanding guidance the Company may have received from those bodies during clinical trial planning and execution. Further, the cost for conducting clinical trials is significant and if our cash resources become limited we may not be able to commence, continue, and/or complete our clinical trials. We may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully.\nBreakthrough Therapy designation for ARO-AAT may not lead to a faster development or review process.\nWe have been granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation for ARO-AAT in the United States for the treatment of liver disease associated with AATD. Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs by providing sponsors with the opportunity for frequent interactions and additional drug development guidance with the FDA and its senior managers.Breakthrough Therapy designation applies to the combination of the drug candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Product candidates that receive Breakthrough Therapy designation may receive more frequent interactions with the FDA regarding the product candidate\u2019s development plan and clinical trials and may be eligible for the FDA\u2019s Rolling Review.\nDespite receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation, ARO-AAT may not actually receive faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval any sooner than other product candidates that do not have such designation, or at all. Furthermore, such a designation does not increase the likelihood that ARO-AAT will receive marketing approval in the United States. The FDA may also rescind Breakthrough Therapy designation if it determines that ARO-AAT no longer meets the relevant criteria.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercialization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unanticipated problems with our products may result in various adverse actions such as the suspension or withdrawal of one or more of our products, closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial penalties or fines.\nIf regulatory approval to sell any of our product candidates is received, regulatory agencies will subject any marketed product(s), as well as the manufacturing facilities, to continual review and periodic inspection. If previously unknown problems with a product or with regulatory requirements are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with a manufacturing process or laboratory facility, or failure to comply with applicable regulatory approval requirements, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions or penalties on that product or on us. Such restrictions or penalties may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, the withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nclosure of the facility, enforcement of substantial fines, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercialization, future regulatory reviews or inspections may result in the suspension or withdrawal of one or more of our products, closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial fines.\nIf regulatory approval to sell any of our product candidates is received, regulatory agencies will subject any marketed product(s), as well as the manufacturing facilities, to continual review and periodic inspection. If previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturing and laboratory facility are discovered, or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory approval requirements, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on us. The agency may require the withdrawal of the product from the market, closure of the facility or enforcement of substantial fines.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health-care providers, pharmaceutical companies, or others selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcomes of such claims, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u2022\nloss of revenues.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies.\nSales of any approved drug candidate will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers such as government insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other health care related organizations, who are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. Accordingly, coverage and reimbursement may be uncertain. Adoption of any drug by the medical community may be limited if third-party payers will not offer coverage. Additionally, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved drugs. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any drug and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge and/or the volume of our sales. We are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payers. Any denial of private or government payer coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue. If we partner with third parties with respect to any of our product candidates, we may be\nreliant on that partner to obtain reimbursement from government and private payors for the drug, if approved, and any failure of that partner to establish adequate reimbursement could have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation, regulations, and policies affecting coverage and reimbursement rates, which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care. Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. There may be future changes that result in reductions in potential coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations.\nIf future reimbursement for approved product candidates, if any, is substantially less than we project, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially greater than we expect, our future net revenue and profitability could be materially diminished.\nWe may not enjoy the market exclusivity benefits of our orphan drug designations.\nAlthough we may obtain orphan designations in the treatment of certain diseases our products are intended to treat, the designation may not be applicable to any particular product we might get approved and that product may not be the first product to receive approval for that indication. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the first product with an orphan designation receives market exclusivity, which prohibits the FDA from approving the \u201csame\u201d drug for the same indication. The FDA has stated that drugs can be the \u201csame\u201d even when they are not identical but has not provided guidance with respect to how it will determine \u201csameness\u201d for RNAi drugs. It is possible that another RNAi drug could be approved for the treatment of a disease one of our orphan products is intended to treat before our product is approved, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity period expires or we demonstrate, if we can, that our product is superior. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Further, orphan drug exclusivity can be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the applicant is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.\nOur success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees, including our senior scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executives and we do not maintain employment agreements with many senior employees. Competition for qualified employees in the pharmaceutical industry is high, and our ability to execute our strategy will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists, management and other employees. This will depend in part on our ability to create and maintain a desirable workplace culture, which may be impacted by the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nature of the office environment and employee preferences for remote working. If we are unable to find, hire and retain qualified individuals, we will have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner, or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage.\nWe have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and expect to continue to file patent applications. Researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we may need to license. Such patent applications may not be available for licensing or may not be economically feasible to license. Certain of our patents may not be granted or may not contain claims of the necessary breadth because, for example, prior patents exist. If a particular patent is not granted, the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished. Further, even if these patents are granted, they may be difficult to enforce. Even if ultimately successful, efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive, distracting for management, cause our patents to be invalidated or held unenforceable, and thus frustrate commercialization of products. Even if patents are issued and are enforceable, others may develop similar, superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us and not infringe on our patents. Our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others. Patent prosecution and maintenance is expensive, and we may be forced to curtail prosecution or maintenance if our cash resources are limited. Thus, the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage. If we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property, the value of your investment may decline.\nWe are party to technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and, if these agreements are terminated, our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected.\nWe are party to license agreements to incorporate third party proprietary technologies into our drug products under development. These license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under these agreements, the terms of the licenses may be materially modified, such as by rendering currently exclusive licenses non-exclusive, or it may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us, which could limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims, which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products.\nBecause the intellectual property landscape in the fields in which we participate is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights. However, if granted marketing approval, we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to render one or more of our drug candidates infringing. If a claim should be brought and is successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, be forced to abandon any affected drug candidates and/or seek a license from the patent holder. In addition, any patent infringement claims brought against us, whether or not successful, may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns. These could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects. We cannot be certain that patents owned or licensed by us will not be challenged, potentially successfully, by others.\nIn addition, if our product candidates are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers, licensees, and other parties with whom we have business relationships and we may be required to indemnify those parties for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims. The claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers, licensees, and other parties regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of those parties or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to continue selling such products.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners and we rely on such owners to obtain, maintain and enforce the patents underlying such licenses.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. We also expect to enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.\nOur success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nOur technology licensed from various third parties may be subject to retained rights.\nOur licensors often retain certain rights under their agreements with us, including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether our licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses, and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. As our organization grows, so does the risk of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, while the company undertakes efforts to protect its trade secrets and other confidential information from disclosure, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we may not be able to assert any trade secret rights against such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and\ndetermine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe may not be able to effectively secure first-tier technologies when competing against other companies or investors.\nOur future success may require that we acquire patent rights and know-how to new or complimentary technologies. However, we compete with a substantial number of other companies that may also compete for technologies we desire. In addition, many venture capital firms and other institutional investors, as well as other pharmaceutical and biotech companies, invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies. Many of these companies have greater financial, scientific and commercial resources than us. Therefore, we may not be able to secure the technologies we desire. Furthermore, should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful, there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and/or technologies.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nOur business model assumes we will generate revenue by, among other activities, marketing or out-licensing the products we develop. Our drug candidates are in the early stages of development and because we have a short development history with both RNA interference and our delivery technologies, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe have no approved drugs and thus have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any products. We have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our RNAi therapeutic business as our drug candidates are still at an early stage of development. Thus, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n\u2022\nExecute product development activities using unproven technologies;\n\u2022\nBuild, maintain, and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nDemonstrate safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in multiple human clinical studies;\n\u2022\nReceive FDA approval and approval from similar foreign regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\nGain market acceptance for the development and commercialization of any drugs we develop;\n\u2022\nEnsure our products are reimbursed by commercial and/or government payors at a rate that permits commercial viability;\n\u2022\nDevelop and maintain successful strategic relationships with suppliers, distributors, and commercial licensing partners;\n\u2022\nManage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses will increase in the near term if we add programs and additional preclinical and clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nEffectively market any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop products, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe may need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop our drug candidates and market any approved products.\nOver the past several years we have entered into license and collaboration agreements with Takeda, Janssen, Amgen and Horizon. Our business strategy includes obtaining additional collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our RNAi therapeutics and other drug candidates. We do not possess all of the financial and development resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies. Unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing capability, we may need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize any drug candidates that may be approved. We may not be able to attract such partners, and even if we are able to enter into such partnerships, the terms may be less favorable than anticipated. Further, entering into partnership agreements may limit our commercialization options and/or require us to share revenues and profits with our partners. If we do not find appropriate partners, or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful, our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected. Even if we are able to find collaborative partners, the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and will be beyond our control. In addition, in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration or licenses to third parties, there are a variety of technical, business and legal risks, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution; and\n\u2022\nDisputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s resources.\nThe occurrence of any of the above events or other related events could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to generate milestone and royalty payments under our current and potential future licensing and collaboration agreements is substantially controlled by our partners, and as such, we will likely need other sources of financing to continue to develop our internal drug candidates.\nFor instance, under our licensing and collaboration agreements with Amgen, Janssen, Takeda and Horizon, our partners substantially control clinical development and commercialization for all of the candidates covered under those agreements. To the extent that (i) our partners\u2019 interests in advancing these candidates or targets changes, (ii) unforeseen scientific issues with the candidates arise, or (iii) the pace at which our partners move the candidates through clinical trials toward commercialization slows, our ability to collect milestones and royalties may be significantly diminished. This would further cause us to rely upon other sources of financing to continue to develop our other internal drug candidates.\nWe may lose a considerable amount of control over our intellectual property and may not receive anticipated revenues in strategic transactions, particularly where the consideration is contingent on the achievement of development or sales milestones.\nOur business model has been to develop new technologies and to utilize the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products. If the acquirers of our technologies fail to achieve performance milestones, we may not receive a significant portion of the total value of any sale, license or other strategic transaction.\nWe will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our drug candidates to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nEven if our research and development efforts yield technologically feasible applications, we may not successfully develop commercial products. Drug development takes years of study in human clinical trials prior to regulatory approval, and, even if we are successful, it may not be on a timely basis. During our drug development period, superior competitive technologies may be introduced which could diminish or extinguish the potential commercial uses for our drug candidates. Additionally, the degree to which the medical community and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain. The rate and degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors, including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products, their potential advantage over alternative treatments, and the costs to patients and third-party payors, including insurance companies and Medicare. Recent efforts in the United States and abroad to reduce overall healthcare spending has put significant pressure on the price of prescription drugs and certain companies have been publicly criticized for the relatively high cost of their therapies. These pressures may force us to sell any approved drugs at a lower price than we or analysts may anticipate or may result in lower levels of reimbursement and coverage from third parties.\nWe cannot predict whether significant commercial market acceptance for our products, if approved, will ever develop, and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market. Our revenue growth and achievement of consistent profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce products that will be accepted by the medical community. If we are unable to cost-effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical establishment and patients, or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products.\nWe rely on third parties for various components and processes for our product candidates. We may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source, other companies may choose not to work with us, or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist or does not exist on acceptable terms. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators which is beyond our control. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, the development of our products would be adversely affected. Therefore, it is possible that our development plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials, components, and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost, if at all, or to get a timely response from vendors, particularly as a result of recent labor market and global supply chain constraints.\nWe have limited manufacturing capability and must rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our clinical supplies and commercial products, if and when approved, and if they fail to meet their obligations, the development and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited manufacturing capabilities and experience. Our drug candidates are composed of multiple components and require specialized formulations for which scale-up and manufacturing could be difficult. We have limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties, who may not be able to deliver in a timely manner, or at all. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals, and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract\nfor, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. Our internal GMP manufacturing capabilities are limited to small-scale production of material. There are a limited number of manufacturers that supply synthetic oligonucleotides. There are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of material to meet our needs. Included in these risks are synthesis and purification failures and contamination during the manufacturing process, which could result in unusable product and cause delays in our development process, as well as additional expense to us.\nAdditionally, our product candidates have not yet been manufactured for commercial use. If any of our product candidates become approved for commercial sale, we will need to establish either internal or third-party manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing partner requirements may require us to fund capital improvements, perhaps on behalf of third parties, to support the scale-up of manufacturing and related activities. We may not be able to establish scaled manufacturing capacity for an approved product in a timely or economic manner, if at all. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to provide commercial quantities of such an approved product, we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a different manufacturer. Engaging a new manufacturer for such an approved product could require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers\u2019 products, which could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize such an approved product. If we or any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, the development and commercialization of such an approved product may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Any inability to manufacture our product candidates or future approved drugs in sufficient quantities when needed would seriously harm our business. For example, recent global supply chain constraints have led to intermittent lab supply shortages, which are critical for our preclinical programs. While we are exploring alternative suppliers for certain critical materials, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nManufacturers of our approved products, if any, must comply with cGMP requirements relating to methods, facilities and controls used in the manufacturing, processing and packaging of the product, which are intended to ensure that drug products are safe and that they consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our approved products, if any, may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. These requirements are enforced by the FDA and other health authorities through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. A failure to comply with these requirements or to provide adequate and timely corrective actions in response to deficiencies identified in an inspection may result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, plant shutdown, or the delay, withholding, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to a manufacturer\u2019s failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, which would seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the development of our products may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials. We contract with certain third-parties to provide certain services, including site selection, enrollment, monitoring and data management services. We rely on these parties to carry out our clinical trials in compliance with GCP and other relevant requirements. Although we depend heavily on these parties, we do not control them and therefore we cannot be assured that these third-parties will adequately perform all of their contractual obligations to us. These third parties may face disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect our ability to initiate and complete our clinical studies. If our third-party service providers cannot adequately and timely fulfill their obligations to us, or if the quality and accuracy of our clinical trial data is compromised due to failure by such third parties to adhere to our protocols, GCP, or other regulatory requirements or if such third-parties otherwise fail to meet deadlines, our development plans may be delayed or terminated. Further, if clinical study results are compromised, then we may need to repeat the affected studies, which could result in significant additional costs and delays to us.\nWe face competition from various entities including large pharmaceutical companies, small biotech companies, private companies, and research institutions.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have more experience in research and development, manufacturing, managing clinical trials and/or regulatory compliance than we do. Our competitors may compete with us for lead clinical trial investigators, clinical trial site locations and patient enrollment. These competitors may also compete with us on recruiting scientific and management personnel. Because our products are in the early stages of development, along with many of the competing products, and given unpredictability inherent in drug development, it is difficult to predict which third parties may provide the most competition, and on what specific basis that competition may be based.\nWe may have difficulty expanding our operations successfully as we evolve from a company primarily involved in discovery and pre-clinical testing into one that develops and commercializes drugs.\nWe expect that as we increase the number of product candidates we are developing we will also need to expand our operations. This expected growth may place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and information technology systems. As product candidates we develop enter and advance through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand due to our development progress, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers, and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, information technology and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology system failures.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, ransomware and other cyber-attacks, human error, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations and loss of intellectual property. For example, the loss of pre-clinical trial data or data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. Further, cybersecurity breaches may allow hackers access to our preclinical compounds, strategies, discoveries, trade secrets, and/or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or private information, we could incur liability or regulatory penalties, including under laws and regulations governing the protection of health and other personally identifiable information, we could lose valuable trade secret rights, the development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we could suffer reputational damage and damage to key business relationships. The risk of a cyber-security breach or other informational technology disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We have experienced cyber-security attacks in the past, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or development programs; however; there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facility in Madison, Wisconsin pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause interruption to our research and development and manufacturing efforts, injury to our employees and others, environmental damage, and liabilities under federal, state and local law. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research, development or manufacturing efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be affected.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster strikes our research and development facility or otherwise affects our business, it could delay our progress developing our product candidates.\nWe conduct research and development in facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and San Diego, California. The facilities and the equipment we use are costly to replace and require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, fires and acts of terrorism; and if our facilities are affected by a disaster, or in some cases even a loss of power, our development efforts would be delayed and significant costs could be incurred. Significant delays in our development efforts could materially impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval and to commercialize our products. Any insurance we maintain against damage to our property and the disruption of our business due to disaster may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA.\nLitigation claims may result in financial losses or harm our reputation and may divert management resources.\nWhen the market price of a stock is volatile, holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of such litigation, arbitration or third-party inquiry. We may not be successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights in current or future lawsuits, investigations, or claims\nthat have been or may be brought against us and, as a result, our business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or claims may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a negative effect on our financial performance and business. Additionally, lawsuits, arbitrations and investigations can be expensive to defend, whether or not the lawsuit, arbitration or investigation has merit, and the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business.\nOur operations, including our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers, are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, exposes us to liability for criminal sanctions, civil penalties, and contractual damages, and reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur operations, including any arrangements that we enter into with healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations, including applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, may constrain our operation and the business or financial arrangements through which we can market, sell and distribute any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nEfforts to confirm that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we become subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of net losses, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and we expect that our operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue our drug development and discovery efforts. To achieve profitability, we must, either directly or through licensing and/or partnering relationships, meet certain milestones, successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more drug candidates and effectively manufacture, market and sell any drugs we successfully develop. Even if we successfully commercialize drug candidates that receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to realize revenues at a level that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability. Accordingly, we may never generate significant revenue and, even if we do generate significant revenue, we may never achieve consistent profitability.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities.\nOur business currently does not generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations. Subject to the success of the research and development programs of our company and our partners, and potential licensing or partnering transactions, we may need to raise additional capital to:\n\u2022\nFund research and development infrastructure and activities relating to the development of our drug candidates, including pre-clinical and clinical trials and manufacturing to support these efforts;\n\u2022\nFund a commercialization infrastructure and activities related to the sale, marketing, customer support, and distribution of our drug products if and when they become approved;\n\u2022\nFund our general and administrative infrastructure and activities;\n\u2022\nPursue business development opportunities for our technologies;\n\u2022\nAdd to and protect our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nRetain our management and technical staff.\nOur future capital needs depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe scope, duration, and expenditures associated with our research and development, including the progression of our clinical trials, with late-stage trials generally requiring greater capital than early-stage trials;\n\u2022\nRegulatory requirements for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nThe extent to which our research and development and clinical efforts are successful;\n\u2022\nThe outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any, and the extent to which our business development efforts result in the acquisition of new programs or technologies;\n\u2022\nCompeting technological developments;\n\u2022\nOur intellectual property positions, if any, in our products; and\n\u2022\nThe regulatory approval process and regulatory standards for our drug candidates.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the future to continue our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of your investment. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities and, in the event of insolvency, would be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets. In order to raise additional funds through alliance, joint venture or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to further delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities. These actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAt September 30, 2021, we had $428.9 million in fixed income, certificate of deposit, and equity marketable securities. Our investments may also include commercial paper, securities issued by the U.S. government obligations, and money market funds meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, and market and interest rate risks, particularly in the current economic environment. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments or a complete loss of these investments, which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. The market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits may be limited.\nWe have historically incurred net losses. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried forward from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. As of September 30, 2021, we had federal, and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $569.0 million and $626.5 million, respectively. As a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) and legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d), NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. Under the CARES Act and 2017 Tax Act, federal NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019 and 2020 can generally be carried back five years, carried forward indefinitely and can offset 100% of future taxable income for tax years before January 1, 2021 and up to 80% of future taxable income for tax years after December 31, 2020. Any NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2021, cannot be carried back, can generally be carried forward indefinitely and can offset up to 80% of future taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused before offsetting potential future income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced an ownership change limitation. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control.\nIf an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management's time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and sales taxes in the United States and Australia. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nRisks Related to Investment and Securities\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which may make an acquisition of the Company by another company more difficult.\nWe have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the Company that a holder of our Common Stock might consider in its best interest. For example, our Board of Directors, without further action by our stockholders, currently has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences and privileges of these shares (\u201cblank check\u201d preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our Common Stock. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe do not intend to declare cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan. The time frame for that is unpredictable and investors should not expect dividends in the near future, if at all.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. Currently, coverage of our Company by industry and securities analysts is limited. Investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive greater coverage from analysts. If additional industry or securities analysts do not commence coverage of the Company, the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fail to publish reports about the Company regularly, our Common Stock could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Further, incorrect judgments, estimates or assumptions made by research analysts may adversely affect our stock price, particularly if subsequent performance falls below the levels that were projected by the research analyst(s), even if we did not set or endorse such expectations. Any of these events could cause further volatility in our stock price and could result in substantial declines in the value of our stock.\nThe market for purchases and sales of our Common Stock may be limited, and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply.\nAlthough our Common Stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, at various times our securities are relatively thinly traded. Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of our stock. For example, mandatory sales of our Common Stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our Common Stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines. It may be difficult to sell shares of our Common Stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.\nOur Common Stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future, without regard to our results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we are early in the stage of our drug development, there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured. Consequently, we expect that the market price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate significantly. We may not continue to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our technology for several years, if at all. In the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance, we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as:\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into or extend investigation phase, development phase, commercialization phase and other agreements with new and/or existing partners;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products, including clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nMarket perception and/or investor sentiment regarding our technology;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of actions taken by regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements regarding developments in the RNA interference or biotechnology fields in general;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements regarding clinical trial results with our products or competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nMarket perception and/or announcements regarding other companies developing products in the field of biotechnology generally or specifically RNA interference;\n\u2022\nThe issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights;\n\u2022\nThe addition or departure of key executives; and\n\u2022\nVariations in our operating results.\nWe will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price. As a result, our stock price may be volatile and such volatility could result in the loss of all or part of your investment.\nStockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional equity issuances.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nRisks Inherent in Our Industry\nDrug development is time consuming, expensive and risky.\nWe are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in animal and early human clinical trials, often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\nClinical trial results may be unacceptable, even though preclinical trial results were promising;\n\u2022\nInefficacy and/or harmful side effects in humans or animals;\n\u2022\nThe necessary regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may not approve our potential product for the intended use, or at all; and\n\u2022\nManufacturing and distribution may be uneconomical.\nFor example, any positive pre-clinical results in animals for our pre-clinical programs may not be replicated in human clinical studies. These programs may be also found to be unsafe in humans, particularly at higher doses needed to achieve the desired levels of\nefficacy. Also, the positive safety results from single dose human clinical studies may not be replicated in other human studies, including multiple dose studies. Clinical and pre-clinical study results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians and others, which often delays, limits, or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products. Clinical trials can take many years to complete, including the process of study design, clinical site selection and the recruitment of patients. As a result, we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies, which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate and shorten the time that an approved product may be protected by patents. If our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials, we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs. If we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies, we could suffer from significant cost overruns, which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies.\nThe healthcare system is under significant financial pressure to reduce costs, which could reduce payment and reimbursement rates for drugs.\nThroughout the world and particularly in the United States the healthcare system is under significant financial pressure to reduce costs. The price of pharmaceuticals has been a topic of considerable public discussion that could lead to price controls or other price-limiting strategies by payors that have the effect of lowering payment and reimbursement rates for drugs or otherwise making the commercialization of pharmaceuticals less profitable. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. These effects could reduce or eliminate our ability to return value to our stockholders.\nRegulatory standards are subject to change over time, making it difficult to accurately predict the likelihood of marketing approval even when clinical trials meet their endpoints.\nRegulatory standards are promulgated by various government entities and are subject to change based on factors such as scientific developments, public perceptions of risk, and political forces. Because clinical trials often take years to complete, it is sometimes possible for standards that exist during the conception and initiation of a clinical trial to change before the clinical trial is completed or reviewed by government regulators. For example, we may initiate clinical trials that are designed to show benefits on relatively short-term endpoints, but ultimately be required to show benefits in longer-term outcome studies. While some government entities have safeguards intended to ensure standards agreed upon by sponsors and regulators at the outset of a clinical trial are applied during regulatory review processes, those safeguards generally permit regulators to apply more rigorous standards where regulators believe doing so is necessary. As such, there can be no assurance that regulatory standards that are appropriate at the outset of a clinical trial program will not become more rigorous during the regulatory approval process and could potentially result in a delayed approval or denial of marketing authorization.", "PERMNO": 80069, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARWR"}
