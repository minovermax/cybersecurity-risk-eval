{"cik": "2186", "company": "RELM WIRELESS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nVarious portions of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report. These risk factors are not presented in the order of importance or probability of occurrence.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes and product development in our industry. The market for our LMR products is characterized by ongoing technological development, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The LMR industry is experiencing a transition from analog LMR products to digital LMR products. In addition, the APCO Project 25 standard is being increasingly adopted.\nWe depend on the success of our LMR product line\nWe currently depend on our LMR products as our sole source of sales. A decline in the price of and/or demand for LMR products, as a result of competition, technological change, the introduction of new products by us or others or a failure to manage product transitions successfully, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our future success will largely depend on the successful introduction and sale of new digital LMR products. Even if we successfully develop these products, the development of which is a complex and uncertain process requiring innovation and investment, we cannot guarantee that they will achieve market acceptance.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry\nWe face intense competition from other LMR suppliers, and the failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our market share, financial condition and results of operations. The largest supplier of LMR products in the world, Motorola Solutions, Inc., currently is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. This supplier is also the world\u2019s largest supplier of P-25 products. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Some also have established reputations for success in developing and supplying LMR products, including providing complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. These advantages may allow them:\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to customers who desire a single source supplier of LMR products;\n\u25cf\nto respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements which may render our products obsolete or less marketable;\n\u25cf\nto engage in more extensive research and development;\n\u25cf\nto undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns;\n\u25cf\nto be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities;\n\u25cf\nto adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to potential employees and strategic partners.\nMany of our competitors have established extensive networks of sales locations and multiple distribution channels, which are more extensive than ours. We may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in the demand for P-25 products could benefit competitors who are better financed and have inventories on-hand that will meet such demand. P-25 products have been brought to the market by an increasing number of our competitors. Our first P-25 portable radio was brought to market in 2003, and in recent years we introduced a new line of P-25 products, the KNG Series, and have since expanded the product line. Bringing such products to market and achieving a significant market penetration for them will continue to require time and expenditures of funds. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, fully functional product enhancements or new products that respond to these and other technological advances, or that our new products will be accepted by customers. An inability to successfully develop and/or market products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face a number of risks related to the current economic conditions\nCurrent economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere remain uncertain. These uncertain economic conditions could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity and financial condition in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf\nPotential deferment or reduction of purchases by customers: Significant budget deficits and limited appropriations confronting our federal, state and local government customers may cause them to defer or reduce purchases of our products. Furthermore, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions may cause customers to defer purchases of our products in response to tighter credit and decreased cash availability.\n\u25cf\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers and distributors: We make sales to certain of our customers through third-party dealers and distributors. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvencies of these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition the end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or directly from us, it could materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nLimited access by us to credit and capital: Although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term, the credit markets may limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe availability of our credit facility is conditioned upon our being in compliance with certain covenants\nWe have a $5.0 million secured credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). As of December 31, 2014 and as of the date of this report, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The loan and security agreement, as amended, governing the credit facility contains certain financial maintenance and restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that would permit SVB to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings at the time of occurrence. We are currently in compliance with all covenants. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with the covenants in the future or, in the event we fail to do so, that we will be able to either obtain a waiver from SVB or refinance the credit facility in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers and on a limited number of suppliers of components to produce our products\nWe contract with manufacturers to produce portions of our products and our dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers exposes us to certain risks, including shortages of manufacturing capacity, reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, production yield and costs. If any of our manufacturers terminate production or cannot meet our production requirements, we may have to rely on other contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers. The lead-time required to qualify a new manufacturer could range from approximately two to six months. Despite efforts to do so, we may not be able to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely and cost effective manner and these new manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate quantities of our products from our current or alternative contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our dependence on limited and sole source suppliers of components involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality. Approximately 52.5% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2014 were sourced from one supplier. Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products. The lead-time required for orders of some of our components is as much as six months. In addition, the lead-time required to qualify new suppliers for our components is as much as six months. If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products. This may damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and, thus, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on sales to the U.S. Government\nWe are subject to risks associated with our reliance on sales to the U.S. Government. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 40% of our sales were to agencies and departments of the U.S. Government. These sales were primarily to agencies of the DOD, USFS, DOI and the DHS. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this government business. Our ability to maintain our government business will depend on many factors outside of our control, including competitive factors, changes in government personnel making contract decisions, spending limits, and political factors. The loss of sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, most U.S. Government customers award business through a competitive bidding process, which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us. Even if we are awarded contracts, we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract, which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us. In addition, following a contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer delay or our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding.\nWe have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to utilize under certain circumstances\nIf we incur future operating losses, we may be required to provide some or all of our deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, resulting in additional non-cash income tax expense. The change in the valuation may have a material impact on future results. If we do not achieve sufficient federal taxable income in future years to utilize all or some of our net operating loss carry forwards, they will expire.\nRetention of our executive officers and key personnel is critical to our business\nThe efforts of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Technology Officer, as well as other key executives and employees, are critical to our success. We do not have employment agreements with these individuals, and we cannot be sure that we will retain their services. We carry key-man life insurance of $5.0 million on the life of our President and Chief Executive Officer. Notwithstanding such life insurance, the loss of services from any of our executive officers or these other key employees due to any reason whatsoever could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified operations, development and other personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain necessary personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth\nAcquisitions and other business transactions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We do not have any acquisitions currently pending, and there can be no assurance that we will complete any future acquisitions or other business transactions or that any such transactions which are completed will prove favorable to our business. We intend to seek stockholder approval for any such transactions only when so required by applicable law or regulation. We hope to grow rapidly, and the failure to manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Our business plan contemplates, among other things, leveraging our products and technology for growth in our customer base and sales. This growth, if it materializes, could significantly challenge our management, employees, operations and financial capabilities. In the event of this expansion, we have to continue to implement and improve our operating systems and to expand, train, and manage our employee base. If we are unable to manage and integrate our expanding operations effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to government regulation\nFailure to comply with government regulations applicable to our business could result in penalties. Our products are regulated by the FCC and otherwise subject to a wide range of global laws. As a public company, we are subject to regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing our business and we believe that we have obtained all licenses necessary for the operation of our business. Compliance with existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Failure to comply with these requirements and regulations or to respond to changes in these requirements and regulations could result in penalties on us such as fines, restrictions on operations or a temporary or permanent closure of our facility. These penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not be materially and adversely affected by existing or new regulatory requirements or interpretations.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act directed the SEC to implement disclosure requirements concerning public companies' use and sourcing of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The SEC rules issued in August 2012 necessitate a complex compliance process and related administrative expense for a company once it determines a conflict mineral is necessary to the functionality or production of a product that the company manufactures or contracts to manufacture. Such companies must then conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if the conflict minerals originated in the covered countries and undertake due diligence on the source and chain of custody in order to file a conflict minerals report with the SEC. In addition to the increased administrative expense and management involvement as we navigate the aspects of the new requirements that apply to us, we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us \u201cconflict-free\u201d components, parts and manufactured products, and we may not be able to obtain conflict-free products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for any conflict minerals used in the products that we sell.\nWe engage in business with manufacturers located in other countries\nWe engage in business with manufacturers located in other countries. Approximately 69.4% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2014 were sourced internationally. Accordingly, we are subject to special considerations and risks not typically associated with companies operating solely in the United States. These include the risks associated with the political, economic and legal environments, among others. Our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the political and social conditions in foreign countries in which we maintain sourcing relationships, and changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures and method of taxation.\nWe carry substantial quantities of inventory\nWe carry a significant amount of inventory to service customer requirements in a timely manner. If we are unable to sell this inventory over a commercially reasonable time, in the future we may be required to take inventory markdowns, which would reduce our net sales and/or gross margins. In addition, it is critical to our success that we accurately predict trends in customer demand, including seasonal fluctuations, in the future and do not overstock unpopular products or fail to sufficiently stock popular products. Both scenarios could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on a combination of contract, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights\nCurrently, we hold no United States patents. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors and customers, and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Although we believe that trademark protection, trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements should prevent another party from manufacturing and selling competing products or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be successful. It may also be particularly difficult to protect our products and intellectual property under the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold.\nOur fluctuating quarterly operating results could cause volatility in our stock price\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in volatility for the market price for our common stock. Other factors affecting the volatility of our stock price include:\n\u25cf\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or introduction of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates by us or our competitors or by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of our key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock.\nActs of war or terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition\nActs of war or terrorism (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, employees, suppliers, manufacturers, and customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what impact a prolonged war on terrorism will have on the United States economy, we plan to prudently manage expenses, while continuing to invest in our business and make capital expenditures when they will increase productivity, profitably, or sales.\nAny infringement claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nAlthough we believe our products and technology do not infringe on any proprietary rights of others, as the number of competing products available in the market increases and the functions of those products further overlap, the potential for infringement claims may increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, may result in costly litigation or require us to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement or require us to obtain a license for future sales of the affected product. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any litigation resulting from any such claim could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant resources, including the efforts of our management and engineering personnel.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Nevada law may discourage a potential takeover\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and Nevada law could discourage or prevent potential acquisitions of our company that stockholders may consider favorable. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Preferred stock could be issued, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, which could be unfavorable to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to maintain our NYSE MKT listing\nOur common stock has been listed on the NYSE MKT since 2005. There is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the continued listing standards, which include, among others, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, pre-tax income and per share sales price. If our common stock is de-listed, we would be forced to list our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific requirements of those quotation systems. Selling our common stock would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock. If this happens, we will have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets to raise any additional necessary capital.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may negatively effect our stock price and impair our ability to raise equity capital\nApproximately 4.4 million (32.0%) of our shares of outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014 are owned by certain of our executive officers and directors and their affiliates, and may be resold publicly at any time subject to the volume and other restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. Approximately 68% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2014 are freely tradable without restriction.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or even the potential for such sales, could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.", "PERMNO": 10779, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "BKTI"}
