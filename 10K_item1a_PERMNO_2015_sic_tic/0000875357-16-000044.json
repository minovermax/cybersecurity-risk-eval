RISK FACTORS\nBOK Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries could be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as on its common stock and other financial instruments. Risk factors which are significant to the Company include, but are not limited to:\nGeneral and Regulatory Risk Factors\nAdverse factors could impact BOK Financial's ability to implement its operating strategy.\nAlthough BOK Financial has developed an operating strategy which it expects to result in continuing improved financial performance, BOK Financial cannot assure that it will be successful in fulfilling this strategy or that this operating strategy will be successful. Achieving success is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond BOK Financial's direct control. Factors that may adversely affect BOK Financial's ability to implement its operating strategy include:\n\u2022\ndeterioration of BOK Financial's asset quality;\n\u2022\ndeterioration in general economic conditions, especially in BOK Financial's core markets;\n\u2022\ninability to control BOK Financial's non-interest expenses;\n\u2022\ninability to increase non-interest income;\n\u2022\ninability to access capital;\n\u2022\ndecreases in net interest margins;\n\u2022\nincreases in competition;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory developments.\nSubstantial competition could adversely affect BOK Financial.\nBanking is a competitive business. BOK Financial competes actively for loan, deposit and other financial services business in the southwest region of the United States. BOK Financial's competitors include a large number of small and large local and national banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, broker-dealers and underwriters, as well as many financial and non-financial firms that offer services similar to those of BOK Financial. Large national financial institutions have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources. Such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than BOK Financial does, which may adversely affect BOK Financial's ability to compete effectively.\nBOK Financial has expanded into markets outside of Oklahoma, where it competes with a large number of financial institutions that have an established customer base and greater market share than BOK Financial. BOK Financial may not be able to continue to compete successfully in these markets outside of Oklahoma. With respect to some of its services, BOK Financial competes with non-bank companies that are not subject to regulation. The absence of regulatory requirements may give non-banks a competitive advantage.\nGovernment regulations could adversely affect BOK Financial.\nBOKF and BOKF, NA are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit the type of acquisitions and investments that we may make. In addition, certain permitted acquisitions and investments are subject to prior review and approval by banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC. Banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve proposed acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act; and our effectiveness in combating money laundering. They will also consider our financial condition and our future prospects, including projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience, and integrity of our management; and our record of compliance with laws and regulations.\nThe trend of increasingly extensive regulation is likely to continue and become more costly in the future. Laws, regulations or policies currently affecting BOK Financial and its subsidiaries may change. The implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to affect BOK Financial\u2019s businesses, including interchange revenue, mortgage banking, derivative and trading activities on behalf of customers, consumer products and funds management.\nRegulatory authorities may change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations and are likely to increase their supervisory activities, including the OCC, our primary regulator, and the CFPB, our new regulator for certain designated consumer laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations could limit the growth potential of BOK Financial's businesses. We have made extensive investments in human and technological resources to address enhanced regulatory expectations, including investments in the areas of risk management, compliance, and capital planning.\nAdverse political environment could negatively impact BOK Financial\u2019s business.\nAs a result of the financial crisis and related government intervention to stabilize the banking system, there have been a series of laws and related regulations proposed or enacted in an attempt to ensure the crisis is not repeated. Many of the proposed new regulations are far-reaching. The intervention by the government also impacted populist sentiment with a negative view of financial institutions. This sentiment may increase litigation risk to the Company. While the Company did not participate in the Troubled Asset Relief Program and performed well throughout the downturn, the adverse political environment could have an adverse impact on BOK Financial\u2019s future operations.\nCredit Risk Factors\nAdverse regional economic developments could negatively affect BOK Financial's business.\nAt December 31, 2015, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas represented approximately 33% of the total loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma represented approximately 24% of our total loan portfolio. These geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. Poor economic conditions in Oklahoma, Texas or other markets in the southwest region may cause BOK Financial to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in BOK Financial's loan portfolio. A regional economic downturn could also adversely affect revenue from brokerage and trading activities, mortgage loan originations and other sources of fee-based revenue.\nExtended oil and gas commodity price downturns could negatively effect BOK Financial customers\nAt December 31, 2015, 19% of BOK Financial's total loan portfolio is comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry. The energy industry is historically cyclical and prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices could negatively impact borrowers' ability to pay. In addition, the Company does business in several major oil and natural gas producing states including Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado. The economies of these states could be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices resulting in increased credit migration to classified and nonaccruing categories, higher loan loss provisions and risk of credit losses from both energy borrowers and businesses and individuals in those regional economies.\nOther adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have a negative effect on BOK Financial customers and their ability to make payments to BOK Financial.\nCertain industry-specific economic factors also affect BOK Financial. For example, BOK Financial's loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans. A downturn in the real estate industry in general or in certain segments of the commercial real estate industry in the southwest region could also have an adverse effect on BOK Financial's operations.\nAdverse global economic factors could have a negative effect on BOK Financial customers and counter-parties.\nEconomic conditions globally, including those of the European Union and China, could impact BOK Financial\u2019s customers and counter-parties with which we do business. We have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt and our aggregate gross exposure to European financial institutions totaled $8.8 million at December 31, 2015. Our exposure to Chinese financial institution is limited. In addition, we have an aggregate gross exposure to internationally active domestic financial institutions of approximately $200 million at December 31, 2015 composed of $182 million of cash and securities positions and $19 million of gross derivative positions. The financial condition of these institutions is monitored on an on-going basis. We have not identified any significant customer exposures to European sovereign debt, European financial institutions or Chinese financial institutions.\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Risk Factors\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect BOK Financial's business.\nBOK Financial's business is highly sensitive to:\n\u2022\nthe monetary policies implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, including the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements, which affect BOK Financial's ability to make loans and the interest rates we may charge;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates, due to the dependency of the Bank on interest income;\n\u2022\nopen market operations in U.S. Government securities.\nA significant increase in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both BOK Financial's ability to originate new loans and BOK Financial's ability to grow. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates could result in acceleration in the payment of loans, including loans underlying BOK Financial's holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities and termination of BOK Financial's mortgage servicing rights. In addition, changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices, could affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income which would reduce the Company\u2019s net interest revenue. In a low interest rate environment, the Company's ability to support net interest revenue through continued securities portfolio growth or further reduce deposit costs could be limited. An increase in market interest rates also could adversely affect the ability of BOK Financial's floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, which could adversely affect BOK Financial's business.\nChanges in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect mortgage banking operations as well as BOK Financial's substantial holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities and mortgage servicing rights.\nOur available for sale residential mortgage-backed security portfolio represents investment interests in pools of residential mortgages, composing $6.0 billion or 19% of total assets of the Company at December 31, 2015. Residential mortgage-backed securities are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. BOK Financial mitigates this risk somewhat by investing principally in shorter duration mortgage products, which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. A significant decrease in interest rates has led mortgage holders to refinance the mortgages constituting the pool backing the securities, subjecting BOK Financial to a risk of prepayment and decreased return on investment due to subsequent reinvestment at lower interest rates. A significant decrease in interest rates has also accelerated premium amortization. Conversely, a significant increase in interest rates could cause mortgage holders to extend the term over which they repay their loans, which delays the Company\u2019s opportunity to reinvest funds at higher rates.\nResidential mortgage-backed securities are also subject to credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. BOK Financial mitigates this risk somewhat by investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the loans underlying these securities are guaranteed by these agencies.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and other government agencies have implemented policies and programs to stimulate the U.S. economy and housing market. These policies and programs have significantly reduced both primary mortgage interest rates, the rates paid by borrowers, and secondary mortgage interest rates, the rates required by investors in mortgage backed securities. They have also reduced barriers to mortgage refinancing such as insufficient home values.\nBOK Financial derives a substantial amount of revenue from mortgage banking activities, including $78 million from the production and sale of mortgage loans, $56 million from the servicing of mortgage loans and $34 million from sales of financial instruments to other mortgage lenders in 2015. These activities, as well our substantial holdings of residential mortgage backed securities and mortgage servicing rights may be adversely affected by changes in government policies and programs.\nIn addition, as part of BOK Financial's mortgage banking business, BOK Financial has substantial holdings of mortgage servicing rights, totaling $219 million or 0.69% of total assets at December 31, 2015. The value of these rights is also very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Falling interest rates tend to increase loan prepayments, which may lead to cancellation of the related servicing rights. BOK Financial attempts to manage this risk by maintaining an active hedging program for its mortgage servicing rights. The Company's hedging program focuses on partially hedging the risk of changes in fair value, primarily related to changes mortgage interest rates. Other factors, such as short-term interest rates, also impact the value of mortgage servicing rights, may not be hedged. The value of mortgage servicing rights may also decrease due to rising delinquency or default of the loans serviced which are not hedged. This risk is mitigated somewhat by adherence to underwriting standards on loans originated for sale.\nMarket disruptions could impact BOK Financial\u2019s funding sources.\nBOK Financial\u2019s subsidiary bank may rely on other financial institutions and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka as a significant source of funds. Our ability to fund loans, manage our interest rate risk and meet other obligations depends on funds borrowed from these sources. The inability to borrow funds at market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOperating Risk Factors\nDependence on technology increases cybersecurity risk.\nAs a financial institution, we process a significant number of customer transactions and possess a significant amount of sensitive customer information. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile phones, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points. These technological advances increase cybersecurity risk. While the Company maintains programs intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk, there is no assurance that unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information will not occur. The financial, reputational and regulatory impact of unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information could be significant.\nWe depend on third parties for critical components of our infrastructure.\nWe outsource a significant portion of our information systems, communications, data management and transaction processing to third parties. These third parties are sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and misuse of intellectual property. If the service providers encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, reputation damages, and litigation risk that could be material to our business.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Stock\nAlthough publicly traded, BOK Financial's common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System.\nA relatively small fraction of BOK Financial's outstanding common stock is actively traded. The risks of low liquidity include increased volatility of the price of BOK Financial's common stock. Low liquidity may also limit holders of BOK Financial's common stock in their ability to sell or transfer BOK Financial's shares at the price, time and quantity desired.\nBOK Financial's principal shareholder controls a majority of BOK Financial's common stock.\nMr. George B. Kaiser owns approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of BOK Financial's common stock at December 31, 2015. Mr. Kaiser is able to elect all of BOK Financial's directors and effectively control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of BOK Financial's common shareholders. Mr. Kaiser's ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for BOK Financial or any other change in control could have an adverse effect on the market price for BOK Financial's common stock. A substantial majority of BOK Financial's directors are not officers or employees of BOK Financial or any of its affiliates. However, because of Mr. Kaiser's control over the election of BOK Financial's directors, he could change the composition of BOK Financial's Board of Directors so that it would not have a majority of outside directors.\nPossible future sales of shares by BOK Financial's principal shareholder could adversely affect the market price of BOK Financial's common stock.\nMr. Kaiser has the right to sell shares of BOK Financial's common stock in compliance with the federal securities laws at any time, or from time to time. The federal securities laws will be the only restrictions on Mr. Kaiser's ability to sell. Because of his current control of BOK Financial, Mr. Kaiser could sell large amounts of his shares of BOK Financial's common stock by causing BOK Financial to file a registration statement that would allow him to sell shares more easily. In addition, Mr. Kaiser could sell his shares of BOK Financial's common stock without registration under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Although BOK Financial can make no predictions as to the effect, if any, that such sales would have on the market price of BOK Financial's common stock, sales of substantial amounts of BOK Financial's common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect market prices. If Mr. Kaiser sells or transfers his shares of BOK Financial's common stock as a block, another person or entity could become BOK Financial's controlling shareholder.\nStatutory restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other distributions and debts of BOK Financial's subsidiaries could limit amounts BOK Financial's subsidiaries may pay to BOK Financial.\nA substantial portion of BOK Financial's cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by the Bank. Statutory provisions and regulations restrict the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to BOK Financial without regulatory approval. Management also developed, and the BOK Financial board of directors approved, an internal capital policy that is more restrictive than the regulatory capital standards. In the event of liquidation, creditors of the Bank and other non-bank subsidiaries of BOK Financial are entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary before BOK Financial, as holder of an equity interest in the subsidiaries, is entitled to receive any distributions.", "PERMNO": 76892, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BOKF"}
