{"cik": "1001838", "company": "SOUTHERN COPPER CORP/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nEvery investor or potential investor in Southern Copper Corporation should carefully consider the following risk factors.\nFinancial risks\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the price of copper and the other metals we produce.\nOur financial performance is significantly affected by the market prices of the metals that we produce, particularly the market prices of copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. Historically, these prices have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including international economic and political conditions, levels of supply and demand, the availability and costs of substitutes, inventory levels maintained by users, actions of participants in the commodities markets and currency exchange rates. In addition, the market prices of copper and certain other metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short-term changes. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent negative impact on the global economy created significant volatility in the financial markets, including the copper market.\nOver the last three years, approximately 81% of our revenues came from the sale of copper; 7% from molybdenum; 5% from silver; and 4% from zinc. Please see the distribution of our revenues per product on Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d Note 18 \u201cSegment and Related Information-Sales value per segment\u201d on page 157.\nSee also historical average price of our products on Item 1 Business caption \u201cMetals prices\u201d.\nWe cannot predict if metals prices will rise or fall in the future. Future declines in metals prices, and for copper in particular, will have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Under very adverse market conditions, we might consider curtailing or modifying some of our mining and processing operations.\nOur business requires levels of capital investments that we may not be able to maintain.\nOur business is capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration and exploitation of copper and other metal reserves, mining, smelting and refining costs, the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with laws and regulations require significant capital investments. We must continue to invest capital to maintain or increase the amount of copper reserves that we exploit and the amount of copper and other metals we produce. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production at levels that generate sufficient cash, or that we will have access to sufficient financing to continue our exploration, exploitation and refining activities at or above present levels.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our Minera Mexico subsidiary may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur financing instruments and those of our Minera Mexico subsidiary include financial and other restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our and Minera Mexico\u2019s abilities to incur additional debt and sell assets. If either we or our Minera Mexico subsidiary fails to comply with these obligations, we could be in default under the applicable agreements. This situation, if not addressed or waived, could require immediate repayment of debt obligations. Our Minera Mexico subsidiary is further limited by the terms of its outstanding notes, which also restrict the Company\u2019s applicable incurrence of debt and liens. In addition, future credit facilities may contain limitations on our capacity to incur additional debt and liens; dispose of assets; or pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nWe may not pay a significant amount of our net income as cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe have distributed a significant amount of our net income as dividends since 1996. Our dividend practice is subject to change at the discretion of our Board of Directors at any time. The amount that we pay in dividends is subject to a number of factors, including the results of our operations; our financial condition; cash requirements; tax considerations; future prospects; legal restrictions; contractual restrictions in credit agreements; limitations imposed by the government of Peru, Mexico or other countries where we have significant operations; and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Depending on our capital investment program and global economic conditions, it is possible that future dividend distributions will fall below levels seen in recent years.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nThrough 2020, the Company recognized the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit was considered more likely than not to be realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income and existing tax laws. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recognize the expected future benefits of deferred tax assets; this inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nOperational risks\nOur actual reserves may not conform to our current estimates of our ore deposits and our long-term viability depends on our ability to replenish ore reserves.\nThere is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves. Until reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as estimates only. The proven and probable ore reserves data included in this report are estimates prepared by us based on evaluation methods generally used in the mining industry. We may be required in the future to revise our reserves estimates based on our actual production. We cannot assure you that our actual reserves conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations or that the estimated volume and grade of ore will be recovered. Market prices of our metals, increased production costs, reduced recovery rates, short-term operating factors, royalty charges and other factors may render proven and probable reserves uneconomic to exploit and may result in revisions of reserves data from time to time. Reserves data are not indicative of future results of operations. Our reserves are depleted as we mine. We depend on our ability to replenish our ore reserves for our long-term viability. We use several strategies to replenish and increase our ore reserves, including exploration and investment in properties located near our existing mine sites and investing in technology that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost-effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic. Acquisitions may also contribute to increasing ore reserves and we review potential acquisition opportunities on a regular basis. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue with our strategy to replenish reserves indefinitely.\nOur operations are subject to risks, some of which are not insurable.\nThe business of mining, smelting and refining copper, zinc and other metals is subject to a number of risks and hazards, including industrial accidents, labor disputes, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, changes in the regulatory environment, environmental hazards, weather and other natural phenomena, such as seismic activity, wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments, and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates. The Company\u2019s operations may also be affected by mudslides and flash floods caused by torrential rains.\nSuch occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mining operations resulting in monetary losses and possible legal liability. In particular, surface and underground mining and related processing activities present inherent risks of injury to personnel, loss of life and damage to equipment.\nThe waste rock and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. We maintain large tailings impoundments containing sand of ground rock, moistened with water, which are effectively large dams that must be engineered, built and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Defects, errors and failures at tailings dams and in other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life. The importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life. For more information regarding our tailing dams, please see Item 2 \u201cProperties-Slope Stability-Tailing Dams.\u201d\nWe maintain insurance against many of these and other risks, which under certain circumstances may not provide adequate coverage. Insurance against certain risks, including certain liabilities for environmental damage or hazards as a result of exploration and production, is not generally available to us or other companies within the mining industry. Nevertheless, recent environmental legal initiatives contemplate requirements for environmental damage insurance. If these regulations come into force, we will have to analyze the need to obtain said insurance. We do not have, and do not intend to obtain, political risk insurance. We cannot assure you that these and other uninsured events will not have an adverse effect on our business, properties, operating results, financial condition or prospects.\nChanges in the demand level for our products and copper sales agreements could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur financial results may be affected by fluctuations in demand for the refined, semi-refined metal products and concentrates we sell at both the industrial and consumer level, and may also be affected by changes in the global economy, including economic upturns and downturns of differing magnitudes. Changes in technology, industrial processes, concerns over weaknesses in the global economy and consumer habits may affect the level of demand to the extent that those increase or decrease the need for our metal products. Our revenues may also be adversely affected by events of force majeure that could have a negative impact on our sales agreements. These events include acts of nature, labor strikes, fires, floods, wars, transportation delays, government actions or other events that are beyond the control of the parties to the agreement.\nInterruptions of energy supply or increases in energy, fuel and gas costs, shortages of water supply, critical parts, equipment, skilled labor and other production costs may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe require substantial amounts of fuel oil, electricity, water and other resources for our operations. Fuel, gas and power costs constituted approximately 28% of our total production cost in 2020 and 2019, and 29% in 2018. We rely upon third parties for our supply of the energy resources consumed in our operations so that prices for and availability of energy resources may be subject to change or curtailment due to, among other things, new laws or regulations; imposition of new taxes or tariffs; interruptions in production by suppliers; and variations in global prices or market conditions. Regarding water consumption, although each operation currently has sufficient water rights to cover its operational demands, the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines or operations, in whole or in part, or shortages relative to the water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. In addition, future shortages of critical parts, equipment and skilled labor could adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nOur Company is subject to health and safety laws that may restrict our operations, result in operational delays or increase our operating costs and adversely affect our financial results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with occupational health and safety laws and regulations in Peru and Mexico where our operations are subject to periodic inspections by the relevant governmental authorities. These laws and regulations govern, among others, health and safety workplace conditions, including high risk labor and the handling, storage and disposal of chemical and other hazardous substances. We believe our operations comply in all material respects with applicable health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations and with new or existing regulations that may be applicable to us in the future could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our financial results of operations and cash flows.\nOur objective is to preserve the health and safety of our workforce by implementing occupational health and training programs and safety incentives at our operations that meet all regulatory requirements and enhance employee performance. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, we are not exempt from accidents. These are reported to Mexican and Peruvian authorities as required. Regarding non-fatal accidents, in the last three years, the Company\u2019s Dart rate (rate to measure workplace injuries severe enough to warrant Day Away from work, job Restrictions and/or job Transfers) was much lower than the MSHA Dart rate (the MSHA Dart rate is published by the U.S.\u2019s Mine Safety and Health Administration, and is used as an industry benchmark).\nIn 2020 and 2018, no fatalities were reported at our operations in Mexico or Peru. Unfortunately, in 2019, we reported four fatalities in Mexico and Peru. The amounts paid to the Mexican and Peruvian authorities for reportable accidents had no adverse effects on our results. Under Mexican and Peruvian law penalties and fines for safety violations are generally monetary, but in certain cases may lead to the temporary or permanent shutdown of the affected facility or the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses. Additionally, violations of security and safety laws and regulations at our Peruvian operations can be considered criminal and punishable by a sentence of up to 10 years of prison.\nOur metals exploration efforts are highly speculative in nature and may be unsuccessful.\nMetals exploration is highly speculative in nature. It involves many risks and is frequently unsuccessful. Once mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures must be made to determine proven and probable ore reserves; this requires drilling to establish the metallurgical processes that will be needed to extract the metals from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. We cannot assure you that our exploration programs will result in expansion or replacement of current production with new proven and probable ore reserves.\nDevelopment projects have no operating history upon which we can base estimates of proven and probable ore reserves and estimates of future cash operating costs. Estimates are, to a large extent, based upon the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques and on feasibility studies that generate estimates of cash operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed; the configuration of the ore body; expected recovery rates of the mineral from the ore; comparable facility and equipment operating costs; anticipated climatic conditions; and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns based upon development of proven and probable ore reserves may differ significantly from those originally estimated. Moreover, significant decreases in actual or expected prices may mean reserves, once found, will be uneconomical to produce.\nWe may be adversely affected by challenges relating to slope stability.\nOur open-pit mines get deeper as we mine them, presenting certain geotechnical challenges including the possibility of slope failure. If we are required to decrease pit slope angles or provide additional road access to prevent such a failure, our stated reserves could be negatively affected. Furthermore, hydrological conditions relating to pit slopes, renewal of material displaced by slope failures and increased stripping requirements could also negatively affect our stated reserves. We take actions in order to maintain slope stability, but we cannot assure you that we will not have to take additional action in the future or that our actions taken to date will be sufficient. Unexpected slope failures, or additional requirements to prevent slope failures, may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition and may diminish our stated ore reserves.\nWe may be adversely affected by labor disputes.\nIn the last several years we have experienced a number of strikes or other labor disruptions that have had an adverse impact on our operations and operating results. As of December 31, 2020, unions represented approximately 71% of our workforce. Currently, we have labor agreements in effect for our Mexican and Peruvian operations.\nOur Taxco mine in Mexico has been on strike since July 2007. It is expected that operations at this mine will remain suspended until these labor issues are resolved. In addition, workers at the San Martin mine were on strike from July 2007 to August 2018. After eleven years of an illegal stoppage, we resumed control of the San Martin mine in August 2018. The San Martin facilities deteriorated during this period and we undertook a major renovation in order to restart operations during the second quarter of 2019, with an estimated capital budget of $97.7 million. For additional information, see Item 2, \u201cProperties-Mexican IMMSA Unit-San Martin and Taxco\u201d, and Note 13, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies-Labor matters\u201d, to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe cannot assure you when the pending strike will be settled, or that in the future we will not experience strikes or other labor related work stoppages that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mining or metal production projects may be subject to additional costs due to community actions and other factors.\nIn recent years, worldwide mining activity has been pressured by neighboring communities for financial commitments to fund social benefit programs and infrastructure improvements. Our projects in Peru are not exempt from these pressures. Our Tia Maria project in Peru has experienced delays while trying to resolve issues with community groups.\nIt appears that in the Peruvian mining environment, it is becoming increasingly important to obtain acceptance from local communities for projects in their areas. This may entail demands for substantial investments in community infrastructure and upgrades that must be met in order to proceed with the mining projects.\nWe are confident that we will move forward with the Tia Maria project. However, we cannot assure you when and that we will incur no additional costs for community infrastructure and upgrades to obtain approval from the communities for current or future mining projects.\nIn addition, a number of collective action lawsuits and civil action lawsuits have been filed against the Company in Mexico through both federal courts and state courts in Sonora. A number of constitutional lawsuits have also been filed against various government authorities and against the Company. These lawsuits are seeking damages and demand remediation actions to restore the environment. The Company believes that it is not possible to determine the extent of the damages sought and believes the lawsuits are without merit. However, the Company cannot offer any assurances that the outcome of these lawsuits will not have adverse effects on the Company.\nEnvironmental regulation, climate change and other regulations may increase our costs of doing business, restrict our operations or result in operational delays.\nOur exploration, mining, milling, smelting and refining activities are subject to a number of Peruvian and Mexican laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and certain industry technical standards. Additional matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to, concession fees, transportation, production, water use and discharge, power use and generation, use and storage of explosives, surface rights, housing and other facilities for workers, reclamation, taxation, labor standards, mine safety and occupational health.\nEnvironmental regulations in Peru and Mexico have become increasingly stringent over the last decade and we have had to dedicate more time and money to compliance and remediation activities. Furthermore, the Mexican authorities have become more rigorous and stricter in enforcing Mexican environmental laws. We expect additional laws and regulations will be enacted over time with respect to environmental matters.\nPlease refer to Note 13 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies-Environmental matters\u201d of our financial statements for further information on this subject.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend on the geographic location of our facilities. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changes in sea levels, storm patterns and intensities, and temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\nWe monitor fluctuations in weather patterns in the areas where we operate. Aligned with government efforts, we are working to measure our carbon footprint to reduce our operations\u2019 contributions to greenhouse gases. We also evaluate our water demand, as weather changes may result in increases or decreases that affect our needs.\nEfforts to comply with more stringent environmental protection programs in Peru and Mexico and with relevant trade agreements could impose constraints on and imply additional costs for our operations; consequently, we may need to make significant investments in this regard in the future. We cannot assure you that current or future legislative, regulatory or trade developments will not have adverse effects on our business, properties, operating results, financial condition or prospects.\nOur mining and metal production projects may expose us to new risks.\nOur Company is in the midst of a large expansion program, which may expose us to additional risks in terms of industrial accidents. While we believe our contractors employ safety standards and other procedures to ensure these projects are completed with proper governance, it is possible that increased activity at our sites could cause environmental accidents or endanger human life.\nOur business depends upon information technology systems that may be adversely affected by disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nOur operations depend upon information technology systems that may be subject to disruption, damage or failure from different sources, including, without limitation, installation of malicious software, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks and defects in design. In recent years, cybersecurity incidents have increased in frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. In 2020, we experienced no material cybersecurity breaches in our systems.\nHowever, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, operational delays, situations that compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of our operations.\nOther risks\nApplicable law restricts the payment of dividends from our Minera Mexico subsidiary to us.\nOur subsidiary, Minera Mexico, is a Mexican company and, as such, may pay dividends only out of net income that has been approved by shareholders. Shareholders must also approve the actual dividend payment, after mandatory legal reserves have been created and losses for prior fiscal years have been satisfied. These legal constraints may limit the ability of Minera Mexico to pay dividends to us, which in turn, may have an impact on our ability to pay stockholder dividends or to service debt.\nGlobal and local market conditions, including the high competitiveness in the copper mining industry, may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur industry is cyclical in nature and fluctuates with economic cycles. Therefore, we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions, such as lower levels of consumer and corporate confidence, lower business investment, higher unemployment, reduced income and asset values in many areas, currency volatility and limited availability of credit and access to capital. Additionally, we face competition from other copper mining and producing companies around the world. Along these lines, significant competition exists to acquire properties that produce or are capable of producing copper and other metals, and some of our main competitors have consolidated, which makes them more diversified than we are.\nWe cannot assure you that changes in market conditions, including competition, will not adversely affect our ability to compete in the future on the basis of price or other factors with companies that may benefit from future favorable trading or other arrangements.\nWe are controlled by Grupo Mexico, which exercises control over our affairs and policies and whose interests may be different from yours.\nAt December 31, 2020, Grupo Mexico owned indirectly 88.9% of our capital stock. Some of our officers and directors, and those of Minera Mexico, are also directors and/or officers of Grupo Mexico and/or of its affiliates. We cannot assure you that the interests of Grupo Mexico will not conflict with those of our minority stockholders.\nGrupo Mexico has the ability to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted for a vote to our stockholders and thus exercises control over our business policies and affairs, including the following:\n\u25cf the composition of our Board of Directors and, as a result, any determinations of our Board with respect to our business direction and policy, including the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u25cf determinations with respect to mergers and other business combinations, including those that may result in a change of control;\n\u25cf whether dividends are paid or other distributions are made and the amount of any dividends or other distributions;\n\u25cf sales and dispositions of our assets;\n\u25cf the amount of debt financing that we incur; and\n\u25cf the approval of capital projects.\nWe cannot assure you that an increase in the financial obligations of Grupo Mexico or AMC, which may be attributable to financing or to other reasons, will not result in a scenario in which our parent corporations obtain loans, increase dividends or receive other funding from us.\nIn addition, we have in the past engaged in, and expect to continue engaging in, transactions with Grupo Mexico and its other affiliates that are related party transactions and may present conflicts of interest. For additional information regarding the share ownership of, and our relationships with, Grupo Mexico and its affiliates, see Note 17 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nUnanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. If rulings are against the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, may adversely affect our financial position or prospects. For further detailed discussion of pending litigation, please see Note 13 \u201cCommitment and Contingencies-Litigation matters\u201d of the consolidated financial statements.\nDevelopments in the United States, Europe and emerging market countries may adversely affect the Company business, our common stock price and our debt securities.\nThe business and market value of securities of companies with significant operations in Peru and Mexico is, to varying degrees, affected by the economic policies and market conditions in the United States, Europe and emerging market countries. Although economic policies and conditions in these countries may significantly differ from policies and conditions in Peru or Mexico, the business community\u2019s reactions to developments in any of these countries may adversely affect the Company business or the market value or trading price of securities, including debt securities, of issuers that have significant operations in Peru or Mexico.\nIn addition, in recent years economic conditions in Mexico have shown increased correlation to U.S. economic conditions. Therefore, changes in economic policies and conditions in the United States could also have a significant adverse effect on Mexican economic conditions, affecting our business, the price of our common stock or debt securities. In 2017, the United States, Canada and Mexico began a discussion to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). In September 2018, the three countries reached an agreement on a new trade deal, which will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d). In June 2019, Mexico\u2019s senate ratified the UMSCA. In December 2019, the three countries agreed to a new review of its regional trade pact, also concluding that the USMCA would replace NAFTA. On January 29, 2020, the U.S. ratified the USMCA and its President signed the USMCA into law. On July 1, 2020, the USMCA came into effect.\nAlthough recent developments in the U.S. have reduced political instability, lifted consumer confidence and boosted the U.S. stock market, it is unclear if the U.S. government will enact new policies with regard to China that will reduce or eliminate trade tensions between the two countries. Despite being the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter, China began 2021 with a relatively optimistic economic growth outlook. A slowing in China\u2019s economic growth and copper demand and continued trade tensions between the U.S. and China could result in lower copper prices which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business and results of operations. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions; changes in the state of China-U.S. relations, including on-going trade tensions; or other governmental action related to taxes, tariffs, trade agreements or other policies are difficult to predict, and could adversely affect demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers and the U.S. economy, and consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, there is uncertainty in global markets due to the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom, which resulted in a vote to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). In December of 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union after an 11-month transition period that started in January. Brexit may adversely affect global political, regulatory, economic and market conditions, including capital markets and foreign exchange markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is likely that instability and volatility will continue in global financial markets until the terms of certain mechanisms of Brexit are clear.\nWe cannot assure you that the market value or trading prices of our common stock and debt securities, will not be adversely affected by events in the United States or elsewhere, including emerging market countries.\nOther international risks\nWe are a company with substantial assets located outside of the United States. We conduct production operations in Peru and Mexico and exploration activities in these countries as well as in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. Such risks include possible expropriation or nationalization of property, confiscatory taxes or royalties, possible foreign exchange controls, changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, extreme environmental standards, etc.\nOur international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the other jurisdictions in which we operate. There has been a substantial increase in global enforcement of these laws in recent years. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law. Any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance does not cover most losses caused by the aforementioned risks. Consequently, our production, development and exploration activities in these countries could be substantially affected by factors out of our control, some of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak) and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, which could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity; additionally, disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters, adverse weather conditions, floods, pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of terrorism and other catastrophic or geo-political events may cause damage or disruption at our operations and in international commerce as well as the global economy, and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 emerged in early 2020, it has quickly spread across the world.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the possibility that other pandemics may potentially arise in the future, represent significant risks for the Company, which include but are not limited to:\na) supply chain disruptions that make it difficult for the Company to order and receive the materials needed to produce\nits products and to ship finished products to our end customers,\nb) financial risks pertaining to receivables due from customers that may become insolvent or otherwise unable to\nmeet their financial obligations,\nc) government responses, including mandates that make it difficult to remain open for business; restrict imports of raw\nmaterials or exports of finished goods; prohibit the Company\u2019s products from being sold in their countries, and other\nseen and unforeseen actions taken by government entities,\nd) absenteeism or loss of employees at our Company, or at our affiliated companies, which involves workers needed to develop, validate, manufacture and perform other necessary functions for our operations, whether due to health reasons or government restrictions,\ne) equipment failures due to maintenance postponements, loss of utilities and other disruptions that could impact our\noperations or render them inoperable,\nf) litigation or government actions against the Company,\ng) a local or global recession or depression that could harm the international banking system, limiting demand for all\nproducts, including those made by the Company,\nh) disruption of banking and financial institutions, which may limit access to loans, and\ni) many other seen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact the Company.\nRisks Associated with Doing Business in Peru and Mexico\nThere is uncertainty as to the termination and renewal of our mining concessions.\nUnder the laws of Peru and Mexico, mineral resources belong to the state and government and concessions are required in both countries to explore for or exploit mineral reserves. In Peru, our mineral rights derive from concessions from Ministry of Energy and Mines (\u201cMINEM\u201d) for our exploration, exploitation, extraction and/or production operations. In Mexico, our mineral rights derive from concessions granted, on a discretionary basis, by the Ministry of Economy, pursuant to Mexican mining law and regulations thereunder.\nMining concessions in both Peru and Mexico may be terminated if the obligations of the concessioner are not satisfied. In Peru, we are obligated to pay certain fees for our mining concession. In Mexico, we are obligated, among other things, to explore or exploit the relevant concession, to pay any relevant fees, to comply with all environmental and safety standards, to provide information to the Ministry of Economy and to allow inspections by the Ministry of Economy. Any termination or unfavorable modification of the terms of one or more of our concessions, or failure to obtain renewals of such concessions subject to renewal or extensions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.\nPeruvian economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted in Peru. Accordingly, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be affected by changes in economic or other policies of the Peruvian government or other political, regulatory or economic developments in the country. Over the past several decades, Peru has had a succession of regimes with differing policies and programs. In the twentieth century, past governments have frequently intervened in the nation\u2019s economy and social structure. Among other actions, past governments have imposed controls on prices, exchange rates and local and foreign investments; placed limitations on imports; restricted companies\u2019 abilities to dismiss employees and have prohibited the remittance of profits to foreign investors.\nIn 2019 and 2020, Peru continued to experience heightened political instability in a context marked by ongoing investigations into allegations of corruption (Operation Car Wash investigation) and confrontation on the political scene. Significant political turmoil in Peru led to a shutdown of the Peruvian Congress and the removal of two Peruvian presidents.\nBecause we have significant operations in Peru, we cannot provide any assurance that political developments and economic conditions, including any changes to economic policies or the adoption of other reforms proposed by existing\nor future administrations, in Peru and/or other factors will have no material adverse effects on market conditions, the prices of our securities, our ability to obtain financing, our results of operations, or our financial condition.\nMexican economic and political conditions, as well as drug-related violence, may have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe Mexican economy is highly sensitive to economic developments in the United States, mainly because of its high level of exports to this market. Other risks in Mexico are increases in taxes on the mining sector and higher royalties, such as those enacted in 2013. As has occurred in other metal producing countries, the mining industry may be perceived as a source of additional fiscal revenue.\nIn addition, public safety organizations in Mexico are under significant stress, as a result of drug-related violence. This situation creates potential risks, particularly for transportation of minerals and finished products, which may affect a small portion of our production. Drug-related violence has had a limited impact on our operations, as it has tended to concentrate outside of our areas of production. The potential risks to our operations might increase if the violence spreads to our areas of production.\nBecause we have significant operations in Mexico, we cannot provide any assurance that political developments and economic conditions, including any changes to economic policies or the adoption of other reforms proposed by existing or future administrations in Mexico, or the advent of drug-related violence in the country, will have no material adverse effect on market conditions, the prices of our securities, our ability to obtain financing, our results of operations or our financial condition.\nPeruvian inflation and fluctuations in the sol exchange rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. dollar is our functional currency and our revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, as we operate in Peru, portions of our operating costs are denominated in Peruvian soles. Accordingly, when inflation or deflation in Peru is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the sol, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our common stock could be affected.\nInflation in Peru in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 2.0%, 1.9% and 2.5%, respectively. The value of the sol depreciated against the U.S. dollar 9.3% and 4.1% in 2020 and 2018, respectively but it appreciated 1.8% in 2019. Although the Peruvian government\u2019s economic policy reduced inflation and the economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, we cannot assure you that inflation will not increase from its current level or that such economic growth will continue in the future at similar rates or at all. Additionally, a global financial economic crisis could negatively affect the Peruvian economy.\nTo manage the volatility related to the risk of currency rate fluctuations, we may enter into forward exchange contracts. We cannot assure you, however, that currency fluctuations will not have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMexican inflation, restrictive exchange control policies and fluctuations in the peso exchange rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough all of our Mexican operations\u2019 sales of metals are priced and invoiced in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of its costs are denominated in pesos. Accordingly, when inflation in Mexico increases without a corresponding depreciation of the peso, the net income generated by our Mexican operations is adversely affected. The annual inflation rate in Mexico was 3.2% in 2020, 2.8% in 2019 and 4.8% in 2018.\nAt the same time, the peso has been subject in the past to significant volatility, which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future. The value of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar decreased by 5.9% in 2020, and it increased by 4.3% and 0.3% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCurrently, the Mexican government does not restrict the ability of Mexican companies or individuals to convert pesos into dollars or other currencies. While we do not expect the Mexican government to impose any restrictions or exchange control policies in the future, it is an area we closely monitor. We cannot assure you the Mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso\u2019s value will not fluctuate significantly in the future. The imposition of exchange control policies could impair Minera Mexico\u2019s ability to obtain imported goods and to meet its U.S. dollar-denominated obligations and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 82800, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "SCCO"}
