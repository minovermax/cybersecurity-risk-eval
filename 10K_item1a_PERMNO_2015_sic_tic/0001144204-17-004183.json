RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of the money they paid to buy the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company Is Heavily Dependent Upon Wireless And Broadband Communications Providers.\nThe revenues and profitability of both the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division and the Cables Unlimited division are, to a large extent, dependent upon the wireless and broadband communications industries. Accordingly, revenues and profits at these two divisions increased a few years ago as the wireless and broadband markets increased. However, the revenues and profitability of the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division and the Cables Unlimited division have decreased during the past two years as these markets have experienced an industry-wide slowdown in growth. The operations RF Connector and Cable Assembly division and the Cables Unlimited division are expected in the future to continue to be heavily dependent upon the wireless and broadband industries. The Company acquired Comnet Telecom in January 2015 and Rel-Tech Electronics in June 2015 in part to reduce the Company\u2019s dependence on these two divisions and to provide other communications products that are not as dependent upon the wireless and broadband markets. However, because the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division and the Cables Unlimited division represent a large portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and profits, an adverse change in the operations of these two segments could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Depends On Third-Party Contract Manufacturers For A Majority Of Its Connector Manufacturing Needs. If They Are Unable To Manufacture A Sufficient Quantity Of High-Quality Products On A Timely And Cost-Efficient Basis, The Company\u2019s Net Revenue And Profitability Would Be Harmed And Its Reputation May Suffer.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s RF Connector and Cable Division\u2019s connector products are manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. The Company relies on them to procure components for RF Connectors and in certain cases to design, assemble and test its products on a timely and cost-efficient basis. If the Company\u2019s contract manufacturers are unable to complete design work on a timely basis, the Company will experience delays in product development and its ability to compete may be harmed. In addition, because some of the Company\u2019s manufacturers have manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and China, their ability to provide the Company with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including political, social and economic instability and factors that could impact the shipment of supplies. If the Company\u2019s manufacturers are unable to provide it with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, the Company\u2019s operations would be disrupted and its net revenue and profitability would suffer. Moreover, if the Company\u2019s third-party contract manufacturers cannot consistently produce high-quality products that are free of defects, the Company may experience a higher rate of product returns, which would also reduce its profitability and may harm the Company\u2019s reputation and brand.\nThe Company does not currently have any agreements with any of its contract manufacturers, and such manufacturers could stop manufacturing products for the Company at any time. Although the Company believes that it could locate alternate contract manufacturers if any of its manufacturers terminated their business, the Company\u2019s operations could be impacted until alternate manufacturers are found.\nThe Company\u2019s Recent Acquisitions And Potential Additional Future Acquisitions Could Increase Operating Costs And Expose The Company To Additional Risks.\nAs part of its plan to operate businesses that are profitable and that reflect the changing market, the Company from time to time sells unprofitable divisions and purchases new businesses. During the past few years, the Company has sold its Aviel, RadioMobile and RF Neulink divisions, and has shutdown its Bioconnect division. The Company has also purchased the Cables Unlimited, Comnet Telecom, and Rel-Tech subsidiaries. While the Company believes that restructuring its operations to address changes in its principal markets will benefit the Company in the longer term, these dispositions and acquisitions have in the short term caused the Company to incur additional legal, accounting and administrative expenses, including the cost of integrating the various accounting systems of its new subsidiaries, upgrading its information systems, and the cost of managing various divisions in separate locations and states. The Company may in the future make additional acquisitions. Accordingly, the Company will be subject to numerous risks associated with the acquisition of additional businesses, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7 the effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements of the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u00b7 the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations;\n\u00b7 the Company may not be able to secure capital to finance future acquisitions to the extent additional debt or equity is needed; and\n\u00b7 assumption of unknown liabilities, or other unanticipated events or circumstances.\n\u00b7 If goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $2.6 million impairment charge to goodwill and $150,000 impairment charge to its trademark related to our Cables Unlimited division.\nAny of these risks could materially harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any business that the Company acquires will achieve anticipated revenues or operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s Dependence On Third-Party Manufacturers Increases The Risk That It Will Not Have An Adequate Supply Of Products Or That Its Product Costs Will Be Higher Than Expected.\nThe risks associated with the Company\u2019s dependence upon third parties which develop and manufacture and assemble the Company\u2019s products, include:\n\u00b7 reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n\u00b7 risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs;\n\u00b7 the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; and\n\u00b7 potential increases in prices due to raw material and/or labor costs.\nThese risks may lead to increased costs or delay product delivery, which would harm the Company\u2019s profitability and customer relationships.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, tradenames and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of fair value based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows. The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or tradenames prior to the annual assessment upon unexpected significant declines in operating results, the divestiture of a significant component of the Company\u2019s business or other factors.\nIn the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company recognized $2.6 million and $150,000 of impairment charges on goodwill and tradename, respectively, related to its Cables Unlimited, Inc. subsidiary. As of October 31, 2016, after the foregoing impairment charge related to Cables Unlimited, Inc., the Company had total consolidated goodwill of approximately $3,219,000 related to its prior acquisitions of the Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries and the CompPro product line as well as $382,000 remaining on Cables Unlimited\u2019s books. The Company has determined as of October 31, 2016 that the goodwill of these subsidiaries and the product line have not been impaired. However, no assurance can be given that events or circumstances will not change regarding the carrying value of goodwill of the Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line. Should the Company in the future determine that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with some or all of these assets no longer is recoverable, the Company will have to record additional impairment losses. In the event that the Company does have to record material impairment charges on either of the Comnet and Rel-Tech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line as well as Cables Unlimited, such future charges could materially reduce future earnings, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nIf The Manufacturers Of The Company\u2019s Coaxial Connectors Or Other Products Discontinue The Manufacturing Processes Needed To Meet The Company\u2019s Demands Or Fail To Upgrade Their Technologies, The Company May Face Production Delays.\nThe Company\u2019s coaxial connector and other product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the third-party manufacturers. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk that a third-party manufacturer will cease production of some of the Company\u2019s products or fail to continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products are based. Each of these events could increase the Company\u2019s costs, harm its ability to deliver products on time, or develop new products.\nWhile The Company Has In The Past Paid Dividends, No Assurance Can Be Given That The Company Will Declare Or Pay Cash Dividends In The Future.\nDuring fiscal 2016, the Company made four dividends distributions to its shareholders (for a total of $0.13 per share). Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors subject to applicable laws, and depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, plans for future acquisitions, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. If the Company does not pay a cash dividend, the Company\u2019s stockholders will not realize a return on their investment in the Common Stock except to the extent of any appreciation in the value of the Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Dependence Upon Independent Distributors To Sell And Market The Company\u2019s Products Exposes The Company To The Risk That Such Distributors May Decrease Their Sales Of The Company\u2019s Products Or Terminate Their Relationship With The Company.\nThe Company\u2019s sales efforts are primarily affected through independent distributors. Sales through independent distributors accounted for approximately 28% of the net sales of the Company for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Although the Company has entered into written agreements with most of the distributors, the agreements are nonexclusive and generally may be terminated by either party upon 30-60 days\u2019 written notice. The Company\u2019s distributors are not within the control of the Company, are not obligated to purchase products from the Company, and may also sell other lines of products. There can be no assurance that these distributors will continue their current relationships with the Company or that they will not give higher priority to the sale of other products, which could include products of competitors. A reduction in sales efforts or discontinuance of sales of the Company\u2019s products by its distributors would lead to reduced sales and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and business. Selling through indirect channels such as distributors may limit the Company\u2019s contact with its ultimate customers and the Company\u2019s ability to assure customer satisfaction.\nA Portion Of The Company\u2019s Sales Is Dependent Upon A Few Principal Customers, The Loss Of Whom Could Materially Negatively Affect The Company\u2019s Total Sales.\nOne customer accounted for approximately 15% and 18% of the Company\u2019s net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although this customer has been an on-going major customer of the Company for at least the past 10 years and the Company has entered into a written distributor agreement with this customer, this customer does not have any minimum purchase obligations and could stop buying the Company\u2019s products at any time. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from this customer or the loss of this customer could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and profits. The Company cannot provide assurance that this customer or any of its current customers will continue to place orders, that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that the Company will be able to obtain orders from new customers.\nDifficult Conditions In The Global Economy May Adversely Affected the Company\u2019s Business And Results Of Operations.\nA prolonged economic downturn, both in the U.S. and worldwide, could lead to lower sales or reduced sales growth, reduced prices, lower gross margins, and increased bad debt risks, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Slowing economic activity, particularly in the telecommunication and data communication and wireless communications industries that represent the Company\u2019s largest target market, may adversely impact the demand for the Company\u2019s products. If the current economic condition in the U.S. deteriorates, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected as demand for wireless products lessens. There could also be a number of other adverse follow-on effects on the Company\u2019s business from a deterioration of economic conditions or from a credit crisis, including insolvency of certain key distributors, key suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers.\nBecause The Markets In Which The Company Competes Are Highly Competitive, A Failure To Effectively Compete Could Result In An Immediate And Substantial Loss Of Market Share.\nThe markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and the Company expects that competition will increase in these markets. In particular, the connector and communications markets in which the Company\u2019s products are sold are intensely competitive. A failure to effectively compete in this market could result in an immediate and substantial loss of revenues and market share. Because most of the Company\u2019s sales are derived from products that are not proprietary or that can be used to distinguish the Company from its competitors, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 product quality;\n\u00b7 reliability;\n\u00b7 customer support;\n\u00b7 time-to-market;\n\u00b7 price;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues may suffer if the Company is not able to effectively satisfy its customers in each of the foregoing ways. In addition, the Company\u2019s competitors or customers may offer enhancements to its existing products or offer new products based on new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements that have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost or higher performance alternatives to the Company\u2019s products. The introduction of enhancements or new products by the Company\u2019s competitors could render its existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable.\nMany of the Company\u2019s competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources. In certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s customers or potential customers have internal manufacturing capabilities with which the Company may compete.\nIf The Industries Into Which The Company Sells Its Products Experience Recession Or Other Cyclical Effects Impacting The Budgets Of Its Customers, The Company\u2019s Operating Results Could Be Negatively Impacted.\nThe primary customers for the Company\u2019s connector and cable products are in the wireless communications industries. Any significant downturn in the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 markets, in particular, or in general economic conditions which result in the cut back of budgets would likely result in a reduction in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and could harm the Company\u2019s business. Historically, the communications industry has been cyclical, affected by both economic conditions and industry-specific cycles. Depressed general economic conditions and cyclical downturns in the communications industry have each had an adverse effect on sales of communications equipment, OEMs and their suppliers, including the Company. No assurance can be given that the wireless communications industry will not experience a material downturn in the near future. Any cyclical downturn in the communications industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nBecause The Company Sells Its Products To Foreign Customers, The Company Is Exposed To All Of The Risks Associated With International Sales, Including Foreign Currency Exposure.\nSales to customers located outside the United States, either directly or through U.S. and foreign distributors, accounted for approximately 3% and 4% of the net sales of the Company during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. International revenues are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u00b7 difficulty in enforcing agreements and in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u00b7 economic and political instability; and the\n\u00b7 burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign sales are also affected by general economic conditions in its international markets. A prolonged economic downturn in its foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the factors described above will not have an adverse material effect on the Company\u2019s future international revenues and, consequently, on the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company.\nSince sales made to foreign customers or foreign distributors have historically been in U.S. dollars, the Company has not been exposed to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. However, if the Company in the future is required to accept sales denominated in the currencies of the countries where sales are made, the Company will thereafter also be exposed to currency fluctuation risks.\nChanges Of Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect The Company\u2019s Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent to a significant extent on the service of the Company\u2019s senior executives. In October 2016, the services of the President and Chief Executive Officer were terminated, and Howard Hill, the Company\u2019s former President and Chief Executive Officer returned to serve as the Company\u2019s interim President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hill will serve the President and Chief Executive Officer until a new principal executive officer is hired. Since Mr. Hill was a founder of the Company and since he has served as the Company\u2019s principal executive officer for most of the Company\u2019s existence, Mr. Hill is familiar with the Company\u2019s operations. Nevertheless, the recent separation from the prior President and Chief Executive Officer, the return of Mr. Hill, and the possible appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer, will result in uncertainty, changes in management styles, and a loss of continuity, all of which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon the continues services of Mark Turfler, its Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of the Company\u2019s three subsidiaries. The loss of the services of Messrs. Turfler or one or more of the presidents of Cables Unlimited, Comnet or Rel-Tech, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company Has Few Patent Rights In The Technology Employed In Its Products, Which May Limit the Company\u2019s Ability To Compete.\nAlthough the Company recently acquired the CompPro proprietary product line and its related patent rights, the Company does not hold any other United States or foreign patents, and does not have any patents pending. The Company does not seek to protect its rights in the technology that it develops or that the Company\u2019s third-party contract manufacturers develop by means of the patent laws, although it does protect some aspects of its proprietary products and technologies by means of copyright and trade secret laws. Accordingly, competitors can and do sell many of the same products as the Company, and the Company cannot prevent or restrict such competition.\nVolatility of Trading Prices Of The Company\u2019s Stock Could Result In A Loss On An Investment In The Company\u2019s Stock.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has varied greatly, and the trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated greatly as well. These fluctuations often occur independently of the Company\u2019s performance or any announcements by the Company. Factors that may result in such fluctuations include:\n\u00b7 any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts, or a net loss in the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual operations;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the Company\u2019s financial results or the results of other connector and communications-related companies, including those of the Company\u2019s direct competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in analysts\u2019 estimates of the Company\u2019s financial performance, the financial performance of the Company\u2019s competitors, or the financial performance of connector and communications-related public companies in general;\n\u00b7 general conditions in the connector and communications industries;\n\u00b7 changes in the Company\u2019s revenue growth rates or the growth rates of the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u00b7 sales of large blocks of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u00b7 conditions in the financial markets in general.\nIn addition, the stock market may, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Accordingly, the market prices of the Company\u2019s common stock may be expected to experience significant fluctuations in the future.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or to remediate weaknesses could materially harm the Company\u2019s revenues and trading price of the common stock. If the Company cannot accurately report financial results, shareholder confidence is eroded in the Company's ability to pursue business and report its financial results/condition, which will negatively affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nInternal control systems are intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. In connection with the Company\u2019s 2016 fiscal year-end procedures, management determined that the Company did not have adequately designed internal controls to ensure the timely review of its accounting for certain complex estimates. Specifically, these weaknesses related to the year-end impairment analysis of goodwill and intangible assets at Cables Unlimited. Based on this determination, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of October 31, 2016. The Company intends to take measures to remediate the foregoing weakness. However, even if the identified weakness is remediated, matters impacting the Company's internal controls may cause it to be unable to report its future financial data on a timely basis, or may cause it to restate previously issued financial data. These events could subject the Company to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements is also likely to suffer if the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As with any material weakness, if remedial measures are insufficient to address these material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements.\nA Cyber Incident Could Result In Information Theft, Data Corruption, Operational Disruption, And/Or Financial Loss.\nBusinesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Although to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 86474, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "RFIL"}
