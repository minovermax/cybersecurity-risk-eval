{"cik": "1378946", "company": "People's United Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nPeople\u2019s United generates most of its earnings based on the difference between the interest it earns and the interest it pays (the \u201cinterest spread\u201d). Interest is earned on loans and, to a much lesser extent, on securities and short-term investments (collectively, \u201cinterest-earning assets\u201d). Interest is paid on some forms of deposits and on funds borrowed from other sources (collectively, \u201cinterest-bearing liabilities\u201d).\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest-earning assets change, compared to when interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities change. Some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on People\u2019s United\u2019s books. Other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities at different rates. It may be difficult to replace interest-earning assets quickly, since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high, or People\u2019s United may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards. People\u2019s United interest spread may also change based on the mix of\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest-earning assets compared to its interest-bearing liabilities. For example, if interest rates go down, People\u2019s United could earn less on some of its interest-earning assets while it is still obligated to pay higher rates on some of its interest-bearing liabilities. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, People\u2019s United might have to pay more on some of its interest-bearing liabilities while it continues to receive lower rates on some of its interest-earning assets.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. In response to the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate has been reduced nearly to 0%. Despite recent elevated levels of inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve recently has indicated that it intends to continue an accommodative monetary policy until such time that substantial further progress has been made towards achieving the Federal Reserve's maximum employment objectives. Accordingly, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, could reduce our net interest margin, interest spread and net income.\nPeople\u2019s United believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, which serve to manage this risk using several different techniques. If unsuccessful in managing this risk, People\u2019s United may be less profitable.\nThe Planned Phase-Out of LIBOR as a Reference Rate Could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including lending and borrowing activities and the purchase and sale of securities, as well as derivative contracts entered into to manage the risk related to such transactions. Notably, as of December 31, 2021, LIBOR served as the primary index rate for approximately\n50% of our loan portfolio. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would no longer compel its panel banks to submit to the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administrator the rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S. LIBOR settings will cease to exist after June 30, 2023.\nIn response to the FCA\u2019s announcement, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate instruments. To date, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate has been identified as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nAs a result of LIBOR cessation, a Company-wide initiative was introduced to assess all applicable loan, deposit and borrowing categories, and develop a comprehensive plan for the transition away from LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable cost and additional risk for the Company. There remains uncertainty as to whether the composition or characteristics of any successor or alternative rate to LIBOR will be similar to, or produce the same economic value as, LIBOR. The transition may change our market risk profile, potentially requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation and increase legal and operational costs. While we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the potential impact of a transition from LIBOR, failure to effectively manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion.\nLending and Credit-Related Risk\nThe Geographic Concentration of Our Loan Portfolio Could Make Us Vulnerable to a Downturn in the Economies in Which We Operate\nAt December 31, 2021, 23%, 19% and 18% of the Company\u2019s loans by outstanding principal amount were to customers located within Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, respectively. Loans to people and businesses located in the New England states as a group represented 53% of total loans at that date. How well our business performs depends very much on the health of these regional and local economies. We could experience losses in our real estate-related loan portfolios if the prices for housing and other kinds of real estate decreased significantly in New England or southeastern New York.\nIf the economic environment deteriorates, or negative trends emerge with respect to the financial markets, the New England and southeastern New York economies could suffer more than the national economy. This would be especially likely in Fairfield County, Connecticut (where the Company is headquartered) as well as the suburban communities of New York City and Boston as a result of the significant number of people living in these areas who also work in the financial services industry.\nIn addition, our ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in the local and regional economic conditions in these real estate markets. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments may be less profitable than real estate loans.\nOur equipment financing business, which operates nationally, could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the national economy, even if those changes have no significant effect on the local and regional economies in which our other businesses operate.\nNo assurance can be given that such conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-accrual loans, an increase in our provision for credit losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.\nIf People\u2019s United\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses Is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Would Decrease\nWe maintain an ACL on loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. In the case of loans and securities, the ACL represents a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the ACL represents a liability account reported as a component of other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. The amount of each allowance account represents management\u2019s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from both internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the underlying instruments. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As a result, the determination of the appropriate level of ACL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates related to current and expected future credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers and securities issuers; new information regarding existing loans, credit commitments and securities holdings; and identification of additional problem loans, ratings down-grades and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ACL on loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in credit loss expense or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if any\ncharge-offs related to loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures in future periods exceed our ACL on loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures, we will need to recognize additional credit loss expense to increase the applicable allowance. Any increase in the ACL on loans, securities and/or off-balance sheet credit exposures will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 6, \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nChanges in Our Asset Quality Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nAsset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. While we believe we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality, there are elements of our loan portfolio that inherently present greater credit risk, such as interest-only residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines with incomplete first lien data, and commercial real estate loans. Each of these portfolio risk elements, where potentially material in the context of our overall loan portfolio, are discussed in greater detail within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Asset Quality beginning on page 52. While the Company believes that it manages asset quality through prudent underwriting practices and collection operations, it is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions and other factors.\nAvailability of First Lien Data With Respect to Our Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit Could Delay Our Response to Any Deterioration in the Borrower\u2019s Credit\nWe do not currently have statistics for our entire portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit with respect to first liens serviced by third parties that have priority over our junior liens, as we did not historically capture that data on our loan servicing systems. As a result, we may therefore be unaware that the loan secured by the first lien is not performing, which could delay our response to an apparent deterioration in the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2021, full and complete first lien position data was not readily available for 31% of the home equity portfolio which, in turn, represented\n1% of our overall loan portfolio at that date.\nIn certain cases, we have obtained missing first lien information through information reported to credit bureaus when the borrower defaults. Data collection efforts, however, can be more difficult in cases where more than one mortgage is reported in a borrower\u2019s credit report and/or there is not a corresponding property address associated with a reported mortgage, in which case we are often unable to associate a specific first lien with our junior lien. See the discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Asset Quality-Portfolio Risk Elements-Home Equity Lending beginning on page 54 for more detail, including steps we are taking to otherwise address this issue.\nOperational Risk\nOur Business Is Affected by the International, National, Regional and Local Economies in Which We Operate\nChanges in international, national, regional and local economic conditions affect our business. If economic conditions change significantly or quickly, our business operations could suffer, and we could become weaker financially as a result.\nDuring certain economic cycles, the housing and real estate markets, as well as the broader economy, may experience declines, both on a national and local level. Housing market conditions in the New England and New York metro regions, where much of our lending activity occurs, may be adversely impacted, leading to a reduced level of sales, an increased inventory of houses on the market, a decline in house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. No assurance can be given that these economic conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-accrual loans, an increase in our provision for credit losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.\nSignificant volatility in the financial and capital markets during this time may lead to credit and liquidity concerns, a recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. Our loan portfolio is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and ACL.\nInternational economic uncertainty continues to have an impact on the U.S. financial markets, potentially suppressing stock prices and adding to volatility. Our foreign country exposure, which is defined as the aggregation of exposure maintained with financial institutions, companies or individuals in a given country outside of the U.S., is minimal and indirect, with the majority of such exposure comprised of corporate debt securities. Our sovereign credit exposure is comprised of an immaterial amount of government bonds issued by a single non-European sovereign.\nOur Goodwill May be Determined to be Impaired at a Future Date Depending on the Results of Periodic Impairment Evaluations\nPeople\u2019s United evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently, if necessary). According to applicable accounting requirements, acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the quoted market price for People\u2019s United\u2019s common stock were to decline significantly, or if it was determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, we would be required to write down the asset recorded for goodwill as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. This, in turn, would result in a non-cash charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity. See Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 8, \u201cGoodwill and Other Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe Depend on Our Executive Officers and Key Personnel to Continue Implementing Our Long-Term Business Strategy and Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. This factor presents greater risk when we are expanding into new markets, developing new product lines, or significantly enhancing staffing in certain areas, particularly technology. Such competition could lead to increased expenses in affected business areas.\nA Failure In or Breach Of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third-Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-Attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on our ability to securely process, record, monitor and store data associated with a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. In doing so, our business relies on various digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct operations, and for which we have information security procedures and controls in place. Still, as customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, breakdowns and security breaches.\nSecurity breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer or proprietary information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further sources of operational and information security risk to us include (i) our customers, who, when accessing our products and services, may use computers or mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems and (ii) third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities (including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations) should they suffer breakdowns, failures or capacity constraints of their own systems.\nIn recent years, information security risks for financial institutions, such as ours, have increased due, in part, to (i) the proliferation of new technologies, including internet and mobile banking capabilities, to conduct financial transactions and\n(ii) the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, hostile foreign governments, activists and other external parties. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. There have also been highly-publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information.\nAttempts to compromise our cybersecurity occur regularly. While we have not, to date, experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things: (i) the constantly evolving nature of these threats; (ii) the size and scale of People\u2019s United; (iii) our plans to continue implementing our internet and mobile banking strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions in order to serve our customers when and how they want to be served; (iv) our expanded geographic footprint; (v) the outsourcing of some of our business operations;\nand (vi) the continued uncertain global economic environment. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to increase in number, intensity and sophistication, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational harm, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Risks That Could Adversely Affect Our Reputation and the Market Price of Our Securities\nPeople\u2019s United is subject to a variety of risks arising from environmental, social and corporate governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, including climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of our work force, and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel, customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business. Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nOur relationships and reputation with existing and prospective customers and third parties with which we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any negative publicity, whether through traditional media forums or social media platforms, that may arise in connection with the broader public\u2019s view with respect to ESG matters. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for securities.\nInvestors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address ESG matters when making investment and operational decisions. Certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to the risks posed by climate change and other ESG matters into their investment decision. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that the People\u2019s United has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nClimate Change and Related Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Result in Costs That Could Adversely Impact Our Business\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change have created an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment which, in turn, has increased the level of political and social attention to the issue. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change, particularly under the current Presidential administration.\nIn October 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, of which the OCC is a member, identified climate-related financial risk as an \u201cemerging threat\u201d to financial stability. The federal banking agencies, including the Comptroller of the Currency, emphasized that climate-related risks, both physical and transitional, are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes and, as such, are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks\u2019 risk management practices.\nTo that end, in December 2021, the OCC published proposed principles for climate risk management by larger banking organizations. The OCC also appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management. Further, the Federal Reserve Board has signaled that it is in the process of developing scenario analysis intended to enable the modeling of the possible financial risks associated with climate change. For these reasons, we believe that our regulators will, eventually, expect us to enhance our internal control programs and processes, including with respect to stress testing under a variety of adverse scenarios and related capital planning. To the extent that these initiatives lead to new regulations or supervisory guidance, we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks.\nGiven the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a financial institution, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to People\u2019s United. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExternal and Market-Related Risk\nIn Response to Competitive Pressures, Our Costs Could Increase if We Were Required to Increase Our Service and Convenience Levels or Our Margins Could Decrease if We Were Required to Increase Deposit Rates or Lower Interest Rates on Loans\nPeople\u2019s United faces significant competition for deposits and loans. In deciding where to deposit their money, many people look first at the interest rate they will earn. They also might consider whether a bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have been a customer of a bank before, what their experience was like. People also like convenience,\nso the number of offices and banking hours may be important. Some people also prefer the availability of on-line services.\nPeople\u2019s United competes with other banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and money market funds for deposits. Some people may decide to buy bonds or similar kinds of investments issued by companies or by federal, state and local governments and agencies, instead of opening a deposit account.\nIn making decisions about loans, many people consider the interest rate they will have to pay. They also consider any extra fees they might have to pay in order to obtain a loan. Many business loans are more complicated because there may not be a standard type of loan that meets all of the customer\u2019s needs. Business borrowers consider many different factors that are not all financial in nature, including the type and amount of security the lender wants and other terms of the loan that do not involve the interest rate.\nPeople\u2019s United competes with other banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for loans. Insurance companies also compete with People\u2019s United for some types of commercial loans.\nSeveral of People\u2019s United\u2019s competitors have branches in the same market area as it does, some of which are much larger than it is. The New England region, including Connecticut, which is People\u2019s United\u2019s predominant market, and specifically Fairfield County, where People\u2019s United is headquartered, is an attractive banking market. As locally-based banks continue to be acquired by large regional and national companies, there are not as many bank competitors in our market as there used to be, but the remaining ones are typically larger and have more resources than the banks they acquired.\nPeople\u2019s United also has competition from outside its own market area. A bank that does not have any branches in our primary markets can still have customers there by providing online banking services. It requires significant investment to set up and maintain a branch system. Banks that do not invest as much of their resources on branches might be more profitable than we are, even if they pay higher interest on deposits and charge lower interest on loans.\nMore recently, competition from companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants has increased. In particular, technology companies are increasingly focusing on the financial sector, either in partnership with competitor banking organizations or on their own. These companies (referred to as \u201cfintechs\u201d) are generally not subject to the same regulatory burdens as traditional financial institutions and my, as a result, realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable terms and with greater convenience to the customer. This competition could result in the loss of customers and revenue in areas where fintechs are operating.\nFee Revenues From Overdraft Protection Programs Represent a Significant Portion of Our Non-Interest Income and May Be Subject to Increased Supervisory Scrutiny\nRevenues derived from overdraft transaction fees associated with overdraft protection programs offered to customers represent a significant portion of our non-interest income. In recent months, certain members of Congress as well as the OCC and CFPB have expressed a heightened interest in bank overdraft protection programs. In December 2021, the CFPB published a report providing data on banks\u2019 overdraft and non-sufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations regarding consumer protection issues relating to participation in such programs. The CFPB has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against banking organizations that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful. In addition, the Comptroller of the Currency has identified potential options for reform of national bank overdraft protection practices, including providing a grace period before the imposition of a fee, refraining from charging multiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether.\nIn response to this increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny, and in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future, certain banking organizations have begun to modify their overdraft protection programs, including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees. These competitive pressures from our peers, as well as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies with respect to banks\u2019 overdraft protection practices, could cause us to modify our program and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as supervisory expectations and industry practices regarding overdraft protection programs change, our continued offering of overdraft protection could result in increased reputation risk.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risk\nChanges in Federal and State Regulation Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments. Banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.\nBanking laws and rules can change at any time. The government agencies responsible for supervising People\u2019s United\u2019s businesses can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules, even if the rules themselves do not change. We need to ensure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules. We might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply. Our business might suffer in other ways as well.\nChanges in state and federal tax laws or the accounting standards we are required to follow can make our business less profitable. Changes in the government\u2019s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans. Changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business.\nThe government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially. They can force People\u2019s United to hold additional capital, pay higher deposit insurance premiums, stop paying dividends, stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits. If the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps, it would probably make our business less profitable.\nGiven the recent change in Presidential administration, financial institutions may become subject to increased scrutiny and more extensive legal and regulatory requirements than under the prior Presidential and Congressional regime. Congressional committees with jurisdiction over the banking sector have pursued oversight and legislative initiatives in a variety of areas, including addressing climate-related risks, promoting diversity and equality within the banking industry and addressing other ESG matters, improving competition in the banking sector and enhancing oversight of bank mergers and acquisitions, establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets and markets, and oversight of the COVID-19 pandemic response and economic recovery. The prospects for the enactment of major banking reform legislation under the new Congress are unclear at this time.\nFurther, changes in the Presidential administration has resulted in change in key personnel within agencies that regulate People\u2019s United, including the federal banking regulators, the CFPB, the SEC and the Treasury Department. Moreover, certain significant leadership positions are yet to be filled, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the Chair of the FDIC and three vacancies among the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including the Vice Chair for Supervision. These changes may impact the rule making, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities, and policies of these agencies and likely will continue to do so over the next several years. The potential impact of any changes in agency personnel, policies and priorities on the financial services sector cannot be predicted at this time.\nWhile it is difficult to fully quantify the increase in our regulatory compliance burden, we do believe that costs associated with regulatory compliance will continue to increase.\nOur Ability to Declare and Pay Dividends May Be Subject to Additional Regulatory Restrictions and We May Not Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock in the Future\nPeople\u2019s United\u2019s stockholders receive dividends, as the Board of Directors may declare, out of funds legally available for such payments. Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from the Bank, the payment of which is subject to numerous limitations under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. In addition, as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nThe Bank had negative retained income (as defined) as of December 31, 2020 as a result of a consolidated net loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 brought about by a $353.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The Bank remains in a negative retained income position as of December 31, 2021 and, as such, both the Company and the Bank may be required to obtain the non-objection of their respective primary regulator prior to declaring and paying a dividend.\nAcquisition-Related Risk\nFailure to Complete the Merger With M&T Could Negatively Affect Our Stock Price and Our Future Business and Financial Results\nIf the pending merger with M&T is not completed for any reason, People\u2019s United\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, People\u2019s United would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative effects on our stock price;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from our customers and vendors;\n\u2022we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, and other fees, whether or not the merger is completed; and\n\u2022our management team will have devoted substantial time and resources to matters relating to the merger, and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to People\u2019s United.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and People\u2019s United seeks another merger or business combination, the market price of our common stock could decline, which could make it more difficult to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration M&T has agreed to provide in the merger. See Note 2 \u201cAcquisitions and Dispositions\u201d and Note 27, \u201cSubsequent Event\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe Will be Subject to Uncertainties While Our Merger With M&T is Pending, Which Would Adversely Affect Our Business\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement May be Terminated and Our Merger With M&T May Not be Completed\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the requisite approvals of our and M&T\u2019s stockholders. Conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, we and/or M&T may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. See Note 2 \u201cAcquisitions and Dispositions\u201d and Note 27, \u201cSubsequent Event\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShareholder Litigation Could Prevent or Delay the Closing of Our Pending Merger With M&T or Otherwise Negatively Affect our Business and Operations\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with our pending merger with M&T. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.\nBecause the Market Price of M&T\u2019s Common Stock May Fluctuate, Our Stockholders Cannot be Certain of the Precise Value of the Merger Consideration They May Receive In Our Proposed Merger With M&T\nAt the time our pending merger with M&T is completed, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain shares held by us or M&T) will be converted into the right to receive 0.118 shares of M&T\u2019s common stock. There will be a time lapse between each of the date of the proxy statement/prospectus for the stockholders\u2019 meeting to approve the merger, the date on which our stockholders vote to approve the merger, and the date on which our stockholders entitled to receive shares of M&T\u2019s common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of M&T\u2019s common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in M&T\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of our and M&T\u2019s control. Consequently, at the time that our stockholders must decide whether to approve the merger, they will not know the actual market value of the shares of M&T\u2019s common stock they will receive when the merger is completed. The actual value of the shares of M&T\u2019s common stock received by our shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of M&T\u2019s common stock at the time the merger is completed. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the exchange ratio stated in the Merger Agreement.\nGeneral\nRisks Relating to the Impact of COVID-19\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate. In March 2020, the United States declared a federal state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to spread throughout the country. The outbreak of this virus disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries. There are a number of factors associated with the outbreak and its impact on global economies, including the United States, that have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on (among other things) the profitability, capital and liquidity of financial institutions such as People\u2019s United.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to our customers, suppliers and staff. A number of states in which we operate implemented restrictions on the movement of their respective populations, with a resultant significant impact on economic activity in those states. The pandemic resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in many states and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and services has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted. The circumstances around this pandemic continue to evolve and will likely continue to impact our business in future periods.\nIn the United States, the federal government has taken action to provide financial support to those sectors of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The details of how these actions will impact our customers and, therefore, the impact on People\u2019s United remains uncertain at this stage. The actions taken by the U.S. government and the federal banking regulators may indicate a view on the potential severity of a downturn and post-recovery environment, which from a commercial, regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period.\nAn immediate financial impact during 2020 was higher lifetime expected credit losses driven by a worsening of the economic scenarios used to calculate the ACL due, primarily, to a weakening in Gross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) and employment in the United States. See Note 6, \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShould the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause disruption to economic activity, there could be further impacts on the Company\u2019s income due to lower lending and transaction volumes and lower wealth management revenue due to volatility and weakness in the equity markets. Other potential risks include credit rating migration which could negatively impact our\nrisk-weighted assets and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due, among other factors, to increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the U.S. government and the federal banking regulators have put in place to support both funding and liquidity. In addition, lower interest rates will negatively impact net interest income. Should the aforementioned economic conditions persist, the impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets could occur. Further, while the Company continues to develop its program for transitioning away from interbank offered rates, including LIBOR, the COVID-19 pandemic could affect its progress as well as the progress of other market participants.\nGovernment actions and support measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may create restrictions in relation to capital. These may limit management\u2019s flexibility in managing the business and taking action with respect to capital distribution and capital allocation. In addition, federal and state legislative and regulatory developments in response to COVID-19 may continue to impact our business and operations by, for example, requiring forbearance on loans, suspending foreclosure sales and imposing restrictions on our ability to charge certain fees. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time.\nWidespread vaccine distribution began in late 2020 and, in many locations throughout the United States, the spread of COVID-19 decreased substantially throughout the spring and summer of 2021. In turn, several of the activity restrictions noted above were lifted in whole or in part in many jurisdictions. However, as a result of the increased spread of new, more transmissible coronavirus variants and the fact that a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has again increased in recent months. This increase in COVID-19 infections has caused state and local governments to consider, and in some cases implement, various activity restrictions and containment measures that previously had been lifted.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to vary significantly by region, and the full extent of the effects of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economies, labor markets and financial markets are still being determined. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of remote working arrangements, eventual return-to-work protocols (including potential vaccine mandates), third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operations, global supply chain constraints, and any further action taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.", "PERMNO": 12073, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PBCT"}
