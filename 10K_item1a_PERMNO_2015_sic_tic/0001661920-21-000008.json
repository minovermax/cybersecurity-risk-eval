Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in the price of these commodities may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity, ability to access capital and future growth prospects are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. The prices of these commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and this volatility may continue in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic and political conditions;\n\u2022the domestic and global supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the level of global oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production;\n\u2022the level of global oil, natural gas and NGL inventories;\n\u2022weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and taxes;\n\u2022volatile trading patterns in commodities futures markets;\n\u2022price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and the ability of OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022global or national health concerns, including health epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak beginning in early 2020; and\n\u2022market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors and others.\nFurther, oil, natural gas and NGL prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 49% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 were attributed to oil, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices.\nAs of December 31, 2020 (Successor), we had in place hedges covering approximately 4,146 Bbls/d for 2021 at an average price of approximately $43.05 per Bbl. To the extent we are unhedged, we have significant exposure to adverse changes in the prices of oil and natural gas that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom 2016 through 2020, the WTI spot price for oil averaged $51.21 per Bbl, which is down substantially from the $85.75 average for the prior five-year period. The Henry Hub average spot price from 2016 through 2020 of $2.65 per MMBtu similarly declined from $3.49 per MMBtu, which was the average for the prior five-year period. The commodity prices displayed even more dramatic volatility in 2020, during which the WTI spot price for oil briefly fell to a low of negative $38.98 per barrel on April 20, 2020 and the Henry Hub spot price reached a low of $1.33 on September 21, 2020. During these periods, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutene, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have suffered significant recent price declines. Such a decline in oil price, if sustained, will have a material impact on our annual revenues and has caused, and may in the future cause, us to take actions to reduce the costs of drilling and our operations. The coronavirus outbreak has weakened demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, and these events have worsened an already deteriorated oil market that resulted from the early-March 2020 failure by the group of oil producing nations known as OPEC+ to reach an agreement over proposed oil production cuts.\nFurther declines or a prolonged depression in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may act to reduce our cash flows further and adversely affect our financial condition. In such case, our liquidity could be reduced, our access to equity or long-term debt might be restricted, and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments might be adversely affected. We may choose to defer drilling activity and/or production from existing wells for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022drilling activity is sanctioned on the expectation of matching the drilling budget with operating cash flows and securing reasonable rates of returns based on the then prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices; if those prices decline and operating cash flows are reduced, there is a risk that drilling may be curtailed or postponed; and\n\u2022operating costs on our Eagle Ford properties are so low that production from these properties would likely continue to contribute to cash flows, but we may choose to defer production in the event that we consider there may be greater value in producing later.\nFurther declines or a prolonged depression in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce economically and negatively impact the value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserve volumes, the carrying value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties, the PV-10 valuations of our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, and the Standardized Measure relating to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. In addition, future declines or a prolonged depression may lead to a reduction in our borrowing base or a redetermination that results in a deficiency.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and is likely to have a continuing adverse impact for a significant period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rapid and precipitous drop in demand for oil, which in turn has caused oil prices to plummet since the first week of March 2020, negatively affecting the Company\u2019s cash flow, liquidity and financial position. Moreover, the uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused storage constraints in the United States resulting from over-supply of produced oil. Oil prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and as changes in oil inventories, oil demand and economic performance are reported. We cannot predict when oil prices will improve and stabilize.\nThe current pandemic and uncertainty about its length and depth in future periods has caused the realized oil prices we have received since February 2020 to be significantly reduced, adversely affecting our operating cash flow and liquidity. Although we have reduced our 2020 capital expenditures budget, our lower levels of cash flow may require us to shut-in production that has become uneconomic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, and the ultimate impact of this pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or mitigate its impact, related restrictions on travel, the ability to distribute and the effectiveness of a vaccine, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on domestic and global oil demand. The COVID-19 pandemic may also intensify the risks described in the other risk factors disclosed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur future cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent on our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas resources.\nOur business strategy is to generate profit through the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our future success therefore depends on our ability to find, develop or acquire additional crude oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economically viable basis. Furthermore, if crude oil and natural gas prices increase, the cost of finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nExploration and development activities involve numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered and that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. In addition, the future cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022lack of prospective acreage available on acceptable terms;\n\u2022unexpected or adverse drilling conditions;\n\u2022elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022limited availability of financing upon acceptable terms;\n\u2022limitations in the market for oil, gas and NGLs;\n\u2022reductions in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;\n\u2022compliance with governmental requirements, laws and regulations; and\n\u2022shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel.\nEven if our exploitation, development and drilling efforts are successful, our wells, once completed, may not produce reserves of crude oil, NGLs or natural gas that are economically viable or that meet our prior estimates of economically recoverable reserves. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially impact our operations and financial position by reducing our available cash and liquidity. In addition, the potential for production decline rates for our wells could be greater than we expect. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent to our businesses, our future drilling results may not be comparable to our historical results.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves with resulting adverse effects on our cash flow and liquidity.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We currently make, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We currently expect to spend between $45 million and $55 million under our 2021 capital program to drill and complete approximately 10 gross wells across our properties in the Eagle Ford, which also includes funding for acquisitions.\nThe actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, crude oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022the costs at which our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are extracted;\n\u2022global credit and securities markets;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of the capital; and\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves and the cost of such reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the Credit Facility decreases as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or we are unable to remedy any future event of default under the Credit Facility or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under the Credit Facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating hazards, natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities and substantial losses, which may not be fully covered by our insurance.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves significant operating hazards and risks such as:\n\u2022well blowouts;\n\u2022mechanical failures;\n\u2022fires and explosions;\n\u2022pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which could release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022earthquakes and natural disasters;\n\u2022geologic formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022pipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022releases of toxic gases; and\n\u2022other environmental hazards and risks.\nAny of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others.\nWe maintain insurance against losses and liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that our management believes to be prudent. However, we are not insured against all operational risks and such coverage is not available to us. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nWe could sustain significant losses and substantial liability for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur planned exploratory drilling involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, the results of which are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns.\nRisks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022landing our well bore in the desired formation;\n\u2022staying in the desired formation while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022running our casing the entire length of the well bore; and\n\u2022being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the well bore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022being able to fracture and stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; and\n\u2022successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, it is more difficult to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling does not meet our anticipated results or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity and/or declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments, we could incur material write downs of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule.\nOur final determination of whether to drill any wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the ongoing review and analysis of geologic and engineering data;\n\u2022the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants to drill and complete the prospects;\n\u2022the approval of the prospects by other participants once additional data has been compiled;\n\u2022economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and personnel;\n\u2022the ability to maintain, extend or renew leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects;\n\u2022additional due diligence;\n\u2022regulatory requirements and restrictions; and\n\u2022the opportunity to divert our drilling budget to preferred prospects on acquired acreage or to secure other acreage by farming in.\nAlthough we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects, we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame or at all. Wells that are currently part of our capital plan may be based on statistical results of drilling activities in other 3-D project areas that we believe are geologically similar rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the prospect area, in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary, possibly materially, from those statistical results. In addition, our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties. In addition, our ability to produce oil and gas may be significantly affected by the availability and prices of hydraulic fracturing equipment and crews. There can be no assurance that these projects can be successfully developed or that any identified drill sites or budgeted wells will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or gas. We may seek to sell or reduce all or a portion of our interest in a project area or with respect to prospects or budgeted wells within such project area.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional PUDs in the future.\nSEC rules only permit, subject to limited exceptions, us to book our PUDs if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement limits our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year time frame.\nOur identified drilling locations are subject to many uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill such locations.\nOur final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the ongoing review and analysis of geologic and engineering data;\n\u2022the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants to drill and complete the prospects;\n\u2022the approval of the prospects by other participants once additional data has been compiled;\n\u2022economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and personnel;\n\u2022the ability to maintain, extend or renew leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects;\n\u2022additional due diligence;\n\u2022regulatory requirements and restrictions; and\n\u2022the opportunity to divert our drilling budget to preferred prospects on acquired acreage or to secure other acreage by farming in.\nAlthough we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling prospects, we may not be able to lease or drill those prospects within our expected time frame or at all. Wells that are currently part of our capital plan may be based on results of drilling activities in other areas that we believe are geologically similar to a prospect rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the prospect area, in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary, possibly materially, from results in other areas. In addition, our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties. In addition, our ability to produce oil and natural gas may be significantly affected by the availability and prices of equipment and personnel.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. Therefore, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nIn addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful or result in the addition of proved reserves to our overall proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations. Our inability to borrow under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness,\nwhether because we are unable to remedy a future event of default under the Credit Facility or if our borrowing base is redetermined downward by the lenders, may also result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves and could result in additional impairment.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Our operations are concentrated in areas in which the oil and gas industry has historically increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, and the costs for those items also increased. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire.\nDevelopment of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves, or PUDs, may take longer than expected and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 63% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped reserves. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires successful drilling and incurrence of significant capital expenditures. Our approximately 49.5 MMBOE of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated $449.8 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could require us to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nFurther, our reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and that these operations will be conducted successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write them off. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow and adversely affect our liquidity and available capital. Our inability to borrow under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness, whether because we are unable to remedy any future event of default under the Credit Facility or otherwise, may limit our ability to finance or develop our reserves as anticipated and may also require us to write off reserves which could result in additional impairments.\nOur producing properties are located in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nAll of our production during the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor) was derived from our properties in the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas. As a result of this geographic concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, weather events or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil or natural gas. Additionally, we may be exposed to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in many or all of our wells within the Eagle Ford.\nApproximately 62% of our net Eagle Ford Shale leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases and result in a material adverse effect on our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nAs of December 31, 2020 (Successor), approximately 62% of our net Eagle Ford leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future crude oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income, are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage and holding on to such leases.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or we timely exercise our contractual rights to extend the terms of such leases by continuous operations or the payment of lease extension payments or delay rentals.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a primary term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established, applicable lease extension payments or delay rentals are made, or such lease is otherwise maintained pursuant to any applicable continuous operations provision. If our leases or term assignments on our undeveloped properties expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. The primary term of the leases for 528 net acres that is not currently held by production will expire at the end of 2021 if such leases are not extended. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and productions costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. If commodity prices remain low, we may be required to delay our drilling plans and, as a result, may lose our right to develop the related properties.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the actual quantities and present value of such reserves.\nThere are uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated value, including many factors beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based on assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results. Reservoir engineering also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Accordingly, actual production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, expenditures and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves will likely vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Any significant variance in our estimates or the accuracy of our assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves.\nWe depend upon several significant customers for the sale of most of our crude oil, natural gas and NGL production. The loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues in the short term.\nFor the month ended December 31, 2020 (Successor) and eleven months ended November 30, 2020 (Predecessor), purchases by our largest five customers accounted for 96% and 90%, respectively, of our total revenues. While we believe that we can procure substitute or additional customers to offset the loss of one or more of our current customers, there is no assurance that we would be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us or at all. The loss of one or more of such customers could limit our access to suitable markets for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. The availability of a ready market for any crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of crude oil, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of crude oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sold in interstate commerce. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future crude oil, natural gas and NGL production.\nOur operating activities expose us to risk of financial loss if a customer fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a customer\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the contract, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a customer\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions and the contractual terms of the transactions. During periods of declining commodity prices, if any of our customers fail to pay their revenue accounts receivable when due, this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe discounted future net cash flows is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. The current requirements for crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation and disclosures require the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves to be based on the average of the sales price on the first day of each month in the applicable year, with costs determined as of the date of the estimate. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022the actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022our actual operating costs in producing crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022increases or decreases in consumption of crude oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022changes in governmental laws and regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nWe have incurred losses from operations for various periods since our inception and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss from operations of $227.9 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2020 (Predecessor), while we incurred a net profit from operations of $4.5 million for the month ended December 31, 2020 (Successor). Our development of, and participation in, an increasingly larger number of prospects has required, and will continue to require, substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and other risk factors disclosed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors may impede our ability to economically find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to operate profitability and may not receive positive cash flows from operating activities in the future, which could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nIf crude oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to write-down the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties.\nWe review our proved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties, which may result in a decrease in the amount we can borrow under our Credit Facility. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility or other indebtedness and adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nOur inability to market our crude oil and natural gas could adversely affect our business.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and gathering facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on favorable terms could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby requiring compression facilities or delivery by other means, such as trucking and train. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our crude oil or natural gas may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended period of time, possibly causing us to lose leases due to the lack of commercially established production.\nWe generally deliver our crude oil and natural gas production through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short-term transportation agreements. Under the interruptible transportation agreements, the transportation of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system, for maintenance or repair of the system or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements. We may also enter into firm transportation arrangements for additional production in the future. Because we are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers under firm transportation agreements regardless of actual volume throughput, these firm transportation agreements may be significantly more costly than interruptible or short-term transportation agreements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our crude oil and natural gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, or field personnel issues or strikes. We may also voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or curtailed, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be adversely affected by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital and increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Disruptions in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, which would impact our ability to finance our operations. We will require continued access to capital for the foreseeable future. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Public integrated and independent oil and gas companies, private equity backed and private operators are all active bidders for desirable crude oil and natural gas properties as well as the equipment and personnel required to operate those properties. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do. There is a risk that increased industry competition will adversely impact our ability to purchase assets or secure services at prices that will allow us to generate sufficient returns on investment in the future.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to manage growth will have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth historically has been achieved through the acquisition of leaseholds and the expansion of our drilling programs. Future growth may place strains on our financial, technical, operational and administrative resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors, potentially adversely affecting our financial position and results of operations. Our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain leases or options on properties;\n\u2022our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects;\n\u2022our ability to develop existing prospects;\n\u2022our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel;\n\u2022our ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors;\n\u2022the results of our drilling programs;\n\u2022commodity prices; and\n\u2022our access to capital.\nWe may not be successful in upgrading our technical, operational and administrative resources or increasing our internal resources sufficiently to provide certain of the services currently provided by third parties, and we may not be able to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors on financially attractive terms, if at all. If we are unable to achieve or manage growth, it may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nWe may lose title to, or interests in, our leases and other properties if the conditions to which those interests are subject are not satisfied or if we do not have sufficient funds available to meet the commitments.\nThe existence of title differences with respect to our crude oil and natural gas properties could reduce their value or render such properties worthless, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We do not obtain title insurance and have not obtained drilling title opinions on all of our crude oil and natural gas properties. As is customary in the industry in which we operate, we generally rely upon the judgment of crude oil and natural gas lease brokers or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and before drilling a well on a leased tract, and we generally make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel before we commence drilling operations. In some cases, we perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability or adequacy of the title assigned to us. In cases involving more serious title problems, the amount paid for affected crude oil and natural gas leases can be lost, and the target area can become undrillable. While we undertake to cure all title deficiencies prior to drilling, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease, our investment in the well and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property. A significant portion of our acreage is undeveloped leasehold, which has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage.\nGeneral economic conditions could adversely affect our business and future growth.\nInstability in the global financial markets may have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition, and we may ultimately face major challenges if conditions in the financial markets were to materially change or worsen. Our ability to access the capital markets or to borrow money may be restricted or may be more expensive at a time when we would need to raise capital, which could have an adverse effect on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures in the future. Such economic conditions could have an impact on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, such changes could have an impact on the liquidity of our operating partners, resulting in delays in operations or their failure to make required payments.\nAlso, market conditions could have an impact on our crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection, which could lead to reductions in the demand for crude oil and natural gas, or reductions in the prices of oil and natural gas or both, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While the ultimate outcome and impact of changing economic conditions cannot be predicted, they may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the differential between benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual crude oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reference or regional index prices that we use to price our crude oil and natural gas sales reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict crude oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for crude oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financing, Investments and Indebtedness\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under the Credit Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or any future violations of the covenants under the Credit Facility may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nThe Credit Facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, with one interim \u201cwildcard\u201d redetermination available between scheduled redeterminations. The borrowing base depends on, among other things, our lenders\u2019 evaluation of our oil and natural gas reserves. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Credit Facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. Effective November 30, 2020, the borrowing base for the Credit Facility was $225.0 million. The first redetermination occurred on February 1, 2021, which reaffirmed the initial borrowing base of $225 million.\nBorrowing availability was $15.0 million as of December 31, 2020 (Successor), which reflects $0.4 million of letters of credit outstanding.\nIn the future, we may not have access to adequate funding under the Credit Facility as a result of a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination, inability to access our available credit due to violations of covenants under the Credit Facility or an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover any defaulting lender\u2019s portion. Further or prolonged declines in commodity prices could result in a redetermination that lowers the borrowing base in the future and, in any such a redetermination, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans or make required repayments under the Credit Facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations.\nThe London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our debt obligations under our Credit Facility may be adversely affected.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.\nCurrently, all of our hedging arrangements are concentrated with three counterparties, each of which are lenders under the Credit Facility. If these counterparties fail to perform their obligations, we may suffer financial loss or be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market for our crude oil and natural gas.\nOur derivative activities expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the contract, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions and the contractual terms of the transactions. During periods of declining commodity prices, our derivative contract receivable positions generally increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. If any of our counterparties were to default on their obligations under a derivative contract, such a default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations, and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes or increase the likelihood that our hedging strategy may not achieve its intended strategic purpose.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nBecause crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to volatility, we may periodically enter into price-risk-management transactions such as fixed-rate swaps, costless collars, puts, calls and basis differential swaps to reduce our exposure to price declines associated with a portion of our oil and natural gas production and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow. The use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas. Our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production, thereby providing only partial protection against declines in crude oil and natural gas prices.\nThese arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which production is less than expected, our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of crude oil and natural gas or a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices.\nThe terms of the Credit Facility may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the Credit Facility. Such a default may allow the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness thereunder and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAs a result of the restrictions contained in the Credit Facility, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions may further affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our current and future financing.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase, reducing our financial flexibility.\nWe intend to fund our capital expenditures in 2021 through cash flow from operations and from borrowings under the Credit Facility and, if necessary, through debt or equity financings. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base and develop oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. If we incur additional debt for these or other purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify and we could face additional risks. Our level of debt could adversely affect our business and results of operations in several important ways, including the following:\n\u2022a portion of our cash flow from operations would be used to pay interest on borrowings;\n\u2022the covenants contained in our Credit Facility limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends, dispose of assets or issue shares of preferred stock and otherwise may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in general business and economic conditions;\n\u2022a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022a leveraged financial position would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and decreases in commodity prices and could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; and\n\u2022debt that we incur under our Credit Facility will be at variable rates, which could make us vulnerable to an increase in interest rates.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations, including the Credit Facility, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may also, from time to time, repurchase or otherwise retire our debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nUnder Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act our management is required to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we previously reported a material weakness relating to the operating effectiveness of controls over significant and unusual transactions - specifically relating to restructuring-related matters. This error was identified and corrected prior to the filing of our Form 10-Q but could have resulted in a material misstatement of the financial statements. During 2020, our management completed remediation measures related to this material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our internal controls will continue to operate effectively.\nIf further material weaknesses are discovered, our financial statements could contain additional errors which, in turn, could lead to errors in our financial reports and/or delays in our financial reporting, which could require us to restate our operating results or cause our auditors to issue a qualified audit report. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe conduct of exploring for, and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs may expose our personnel and other third parties to potentially dangerous working environments. Occupational health and safety legislation and regulations differ in each jurisdiction. If any of our employees suffer injury or death, compensation payments or fines may have to be paid, and such circumstances could result in the loss of a license or permit required to carry on the business, or other legislative sanction, all of which have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions to air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable, regardless of whether we were at fault, for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination, even when multiple parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Aside from government agencies, the owners of properties where our wells are located, the operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal and other private parties may be able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as collect penalties for violations or obtain damages for any related personal injury or property damage. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently. For instance, in January 2021, the current administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration\u2019s policies. As a result, it is unclear the degree to which certain recent regulatory developments may be modified or rescinded and any changes that result in more stringent or costly material handling, emission, waste management or clean-up requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nIn addition, our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected by governmental action, including delay, inaction, policy change or the introduction of new, or amendment of or changes in interpretation of existing legislation or regulations, particularly in relation to access to infrastructure, environmental regulation (including in respect of carbon emissions and management), royalties and production and exploration licensing. Federal and state regulators are increasingly targeting greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations. While these regulatory efforts are evolving, they may require the installation of emission controls or mandate other action that may result in increased costs of operation, delay, uncertainty or exposure to liability.\nHydraulic fracturing has recently come under increased scrutiny and could be the subject of further regulation that could impact the timing and cost of development.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional crude oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into deep rock formations to stimulate crude oil or natural gas production. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is primarily regulated in the United States at the state level, which generally focuses on regulation of well design, pressure testing and other operating practices. However, some states and local jurisdictions across the United States, including states in which we operate, have begun adopting more restrictive regulation, including measures such as:\n\u2022required disclosure of chemicals used during the hydraulic fracturing process;\n\u2022restrictions on wastewater disposal activities;\n\u2022required baseline and post-drilling sampling of water supplies in close proximity to hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022new municipal or state land use regulations, such as changes in setback requirements, which may restrict drilling locations or related activities;\n\u2022financial assurance requirements, such as the posting of bonds, to secure site restoration obligations; and\n\u2022local moratoria or even bans on crude oil and natural gas development utilizing hydraulic fracturing in some communities.\nThe Texas Railroad Commission recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (\u201cOSHA\u201d) for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well also must be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. Any increased federal, state, local, foreign, or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volume of reserves that we can economically recover, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAt the U.S. federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. Further, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 that prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands (which was challenged in a U.S. federal trial court, resulting in a decision in June 2016 against the rule, an appeal of that decision, and a U.S. federal appeals court ruling in September 2017 dismissing the appeals and vacating the trial court decision). The BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017.\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts on surface water, and groundwater, the potential for the disposal of produced water in underground formations to trigger earthquakes, and effects on the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country relating to hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (\u201cEP Act of 2005\u201d), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the \u201cNGA\u201d) and the Natural Gas Policy Act (\u201cNGPA\u201d) to impose penalties for current violations of up to approximately $1.3 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional operations to FERC annual reporting and posting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The impact of the changing demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDrilling activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including in the Eagle Ford, requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities due to drought conditions. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. The effects of climate change may further exacerbate water scarcity in certain regions. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas. In particular, regulatory focus on disposal of produced water and drilling waste through underground injection has increased because of alleged links between such injection and regional seismic impacts in disposal areas. For example, regulators in some states, including Texas, have responded to the potential concern that the injection of produced water (and other waste water from oil and gas operations) into underground disposal wells may trigger seismic activity.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, use and discharge of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn connection with the EPA finding that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) that, among other things, require reduced GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, and the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. In May 2016, the EPA released final regulations intended to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, including throughout the natural gas supply chain. The regulations could affect us indirectly by affecting our customer base or by directly regulating our operations. In either case, increased costs of operation and exposure to liability could result. In September 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 regulations that removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, as discussed above, the current administration issued an executive order in January 2021 called on the EPA to, among other things, consider a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding the deregulatory amendments by September 2021. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the costs of complying with such requirements. The EPA also finalized rules in 2016 that clarify when crude oil and natural gas sites should be aggregated for purposes of air permitting, which could increase our compliance and permitting costs.\nIn addition, Congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane that are understood to contribute to global warming. Energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. In December 2016, the United States was one of 175 countries to adopt the Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of Parties, which requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. On October 4, 2016, the E.U. ratified the Paris Agreement, thus meeting the threshold for the agreement to come into force. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. President Trump formally initiated the withdrawal process in November 2019, which resulted in an effective exit date of November 2020. However, the Biden administration issued executive orders recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement that, among other things, commenced the process for the U.S. reentering the Paris Agreement. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021.\nThe aforementioned 2021 Climate Change Executive Order directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal permitting and leasing practices, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs. The 2021 Climate Change Executive Order also directs the federal government to identify \u201cfossil fuel subsidies\u201d to take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels. Legal challenges to the suspension have already been filed and are currently pending. The administration\u2019s other January 2021 executive order established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (\u201cWorking Group\u201d) to, among other things, develop methodologies for calculating the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d \u201csocial cost of nitrous oxide\u201d and \u201csocial cost of methane.\u201d Final recommendations from the Working Group are due no later than January 2022. Given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility.\nFurther regulation of air emissions, as well as uncertainty regarding the future course of regulation, could eventually reduce the demand for oil and natural gas. As previously mentioned, the current administration issued an executive order in January 2021 calling for substantial action on climate change, including, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across agencies and economic sectors. Other actions that could be pursued include more restrictive requirements for the development of pipeline infrastructure, as well as more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities.\nIncreased attention to ESG matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to climate change, societal expectations on companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts for oil and natural gas products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nMoreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Also, institutional lenders may decide not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies based on climate change related concerns, which could affect our access to capital for potential growth projects.\nRecent federal legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts in order to hedge a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the prudential regulators adopt regulations implementing the derivatives-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. While most of these regulations are already in effect, the implementation process is still ongoing and the CFTC continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we are limited in our use of derivatives in the future as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nThe CFTC has re-proposed position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets, and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits, provided that various conditions are satisfied. The CFTC has also finalized a related aggregation rule that requires market participants to aggregate their positions with certain other persons under common ownership and control, unless an exemption applies, for purposes of determining whether the position limits have been exceeded. If adopted, the revised position limits rule and its finalized companion rule on aggregation may have an impact on our ability to hedge exposure to price fluctuation of certain commodities. In addition to the CFTC federal position limit regime, designated contract markets (\u201cDCMs\u201d) also have established position limit and accountability regimes. We may have to modify trading decisions or liquidate positions to avoid exceeding such limits or at the direction of the exchange to comply with accountability levels. Further, any such position limit regime, whether imposed at the federal-level or at the DCM-level may impose added operating costs to monitor compliance with such position limit levels, addressing accountability level concerns and maintaining appropriate exemptions, if applicable.\nThe CFTC has finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the \u201cswap\u201d and \u201cswap dealer\u201d definitions, swap dealer registration, swap data reporting and mandatory clearing, among others. The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules require that certain classes of swaps be cleared on a derivatives clearing organization and traded on a regulated exchange, unless exempt from such clearing and trading requirements, which could result in the application of certain margin requirements imposed by derivatives clearing organizations and their members. The CFTC and prudential regulators also recently adopted mandatory margin requirements for uncleared swaps entered into between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, in which case we would also qualify for an exemption from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, the European Union and other foreign regulators have adopted and are implementing local reforms generally comparable with the reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. Implementation and enforcement of these regulatory provisions may reduce our ability to hedge our market risks with non-US counterparties and may make transactions involving cross-border swaps more expensive and burdensome. Additionally, the lack of regulatory equivalency across jurisdictions may increase compliance costs and make it more difficult to satisfy our regulatory obligations.\nThe new legislation and any new regulations could:\n\u2022significantly increase the cost of some derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral that could adversely affect our available liquidity);\n\u2022materially alter the terms of some derivative contracts;\n\u2022reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter;\n\u2022reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts; and\n\u2022potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nIf we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the new legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. If the new legislation and regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential future legislation or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nIn past years, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. For example, President Biden has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) an increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations and (ii) the elimination of tax subsidies for fossil fuels. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden administration. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which we operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction could adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Strategic Transactions\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nIn accordance with our business strategies, we periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future crude oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022development and operating costs; and\n\u2022potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems may not be observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may also involve other risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, even if we successfully integrate an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect, including with respect to estimated proved reserves, production volume or cost savings from operating synergies, within our expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices in crude oil and natural gas industry conditions, risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. Failure to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have elected not to be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), regulating corporate takeovers.\nIn general, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL prohibit a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for trading on the OTCQX Best Market, from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022prior to such time, the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding certain specified shares); or\n\u2022on or after such time the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nSection 203 of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to elect not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, we expressly elected not to be governed by Section 203. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects or protections of Section 203 of the DGCL, although no assurance can be given that we will not elect to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL pursuant to an amendment to our certificate of incorporation in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022requiring written approval of our stockholders holding at least 60% of the total voting power of the then outstanding shares of our common stock (and the outstanding shares of any series of preferred stock of the Company entitled to vote with the Common Stock, voting together as a single class) in order for stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws or certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022providing that the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships) or by the stockholders. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors will be filled only by (i) a majority vote of our board of directors then in office, whether or not such directors number less than a quorum, (ii) a plurality vote of the holders of shares of our common stock (including shares of any series of preferred stock entitled to vote in an election of directors) at a duly called meeting of stockholders, or (iii) by written consent of holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock (including shares of any series of preferred stock entitled to vote in an election of directors). Directors so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term to which the new directorship is allocated, and until such director\u2019s successor shall have been elected and qualified or until such director\u2019s earlier death, resignation or removal.\nRisks Related to Our Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, contractors, employees or suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022key suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022the ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court (the \u201cDisclosure Statement\u201d), and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. Although the financial projections disclosed in our Disclosure Statement represent our view based on then current known facts and assumptions about the future operations of the Company there is no guarantee that the financial projections will be realized. We may not be able to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows assumed in projecting future business prospects. To the extent we do not meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned and may be unable to service our debt obligations as they come due or may not be able to meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things, taking advantage of future opportunities and growing our businesses.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting, as a consequence of which we allocated the reorganization value to our individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations from and after the fresh start date are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of the board of directors changed significantly. Upon emergence, the board of directors is now made up of five directors, of which four will not have previously served on the board of directors. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the board of directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. There is no guarantee that the new board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current strategic plans. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be limited as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy.\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by NOLs when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382). Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. Our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of the Section 382, which may limit our ability to utilize out NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nThe limitations arising from our prior ownership change or from any ownership change that may arise in the future may prevent utilization of our NOLs prior to their expiration. Future ownership changes or regulatory changes could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Other General Factors\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition, the results of operations and future growth.\nWe are reliant on a number of key members of our executive management team, and we do not have employment agreements with any of them. Loss of such personnel may have an adverse effect on our performance. Certain areas in which we operate are highly competitive regions and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may be unable to hire suitable field personnel for our technical team or there may be periods of time where a particular position remains vacant while a suitable replacement is identified and appointed. Our ability to manage our growth will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.\nActs of terrorism (including eco-terrorism and cyber-attacks) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur assets and operations, and the assets and operations of our providers of gas gathering, processing, transportation and fractionation services, may be targets of terrorist activities (including eco-terrorist and cyber-terrorist activities) that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, market or distribute natural gas, NGLs and oil. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental and other repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, acts of terrorism, and the threat of such acts, could result in volatility in the prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil and could affect the markets for such commodities.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) (or, if the Court of Chancery shall not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the state of Delaware, or if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder of the Company (including a beneficial owner of stock) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except as to each of (i) through (iv) above, subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. The foregoing provision does not apply to claims under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16174, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LONE"}
