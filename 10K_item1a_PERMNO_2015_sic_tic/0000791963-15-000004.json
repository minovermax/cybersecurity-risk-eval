{"cik": "791963", "company": "OPPENHEIMER HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to numerous risks. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company may continue to be adversely affected by the failure of the Auction Rate Securities Market.\nIn February 2008, the market for auction rate securities (\"ARS\") began experiencing disruptions due to the failure of auctions for preferred stocks issued to leverage closed end funds, municipal bonds backed by tax exempt issuers, and student loans backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. This failure followed an earlier failure of a smaller market of ARS that were backed by mortgage and other forms of derivatives in the summer of 2007. These auction failures developed as a result of auction managers or dealers, typically large commercial or investment banks, deciding not to commit their own capital when there was insufficient demand from bidders to meet the supply of sales from sellers. The failure of the ARS market has prevented clients of the Company from liquidating holdings in these positions or, in many cases, posting these securities as collateral for loans. The Company had operated in an agency capacity in this market and held and continues to hold ARS in its proprietary accounts and, as a result, is exposed to these liquidity issues as well. The Company believes that, although issuer redemptions of ARS have occurred, approximately 15% of the overall ARS issued into the ARS market remained outstanding at December 31, 2014. There is no guarantee that further ARS issuer redemptions will occur and, if so, that the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 ARS will be redeemed.\nRegulators have concluded, in many cases, that securities firms, initially those that underwrote and supported the auctions for ARS, should be compelled to purchase them from retail customers. Underwriters and broker-dealers in such securities have settled with various regulators and have purchased ARS from their retail clients. The Company may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of its competitors that have already completed purchases of ARS from their clients.\nIn February 2010, Oppenheimer finalized settlements with each of the New York Attorney General\u2019s office (\"NYAG\") and the Massachusetts Securities Division (\"MSD\" and, together with the NYAG, the \"Regulators\") concluding investigations and administrative proceedings concerning Oppenheimer\u2019s marketing and sale of ARS. Pursuant to the settlements with the Regulators, Oppenheimer agreed to extend offers to repurchase ARS from certain of its clients subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition to the settlements with the Regulators, Oppenheimer has also reached settlements of and received adverse awards in legal proceedings with various clients where the Company is obligated to purchase ARS. The ultimate amount of ARS to be repurchased by the Company under the settlements with the Regulators or legal settlements and awards cannot be predicted with any certainty and will be impacted by redemptions by issuers and legal and other actions by clients during the relevant period which cannot be predicted. See Item 7 under the caption \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Environment - Other Regulatory Matters\" and \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\" for additional details.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing settlements with the Regulators, the Company remains as a named respondent in several arbitrations by its current or former clients as well as a lawsuit related to its sale of ARS. In addition, the Company is continuing to cooperate with investigating entities from other states.\nIf the ARS market remains frozen, the Company may likely be further subject to claims by its clients. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in defending any or all of the current actions against it or any subsequent actions filed in the future. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company, including its cash position.\nSee \"Legal Proceedings\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory and Legal Environment - Other Regulatory Matters and - Other Matters.\"\nThe Company\u2019s customers held at Oppenheimer approximately $134.2 million of ARS at December 31, 2014, exclusive of amounts that were owned by Qualified Institutional Buyers (\u201cQIBs\u201d), transferred to the Company or purchased by customers after February 2008, or transferred from the Company to other securities firms after February 2008. The Company does not presently have the capacity to purchase all of the ARS held by all of its former or current clients who purchased such securities prior to the market\u2019s failure in February 2008 over a short period of time. If the Company was to be required to purchase all of the ARS held by all former or current clients who purchased such securities prior to the market\u2019s failure in February 2008 over a short period of time, these purchases would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition including its cash position. Neither of the settlements with the Regulators requires the Company to do so. The Company does not currently believe that it is legally obligated to make any such purchases except for those purchases it has agreed with the Regulators to make as previously disclosed. If Oppenheimer defaults on either agreement with the Regulators, the Regulators may terminate their agreements and, in the case of the MSD, may reinstitute the previously pending administrative proceedings. In addition, there can be no guarantee that other regulators won\u2019t seek to compel the Company to repurchase a greater amount of ARS than called for by the settlements with the Regulators. See \"Legal Proceedings.\"\nThe Company has sought, with very limited success, financing from a number of sources to try to find a means for all its clients to find liquidity from their ARS holdings and will continue to do so. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in finding a liquidity solution for all its clients\u2019 ARS holdings.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. See \"The precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect employee misconduct may not be effective and the Company could be exposed to unknown and unmanaged risks or losses.\"\nDevelopments in market and economic conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business and profitability.\nPerformance in the financial services industry is heavily influenced by the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity, which generally have a direct and material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. These conditions are a product of many factors, which are mostly unpredictable and beyond the Company\u2019s control, and may affect the decisions made by financial market participants. Uncertain or unfavorable market or economic conditions could result in reduced transaction volumes, reduced revenue and reduced profitability in any or all of the Company\u2019s principal businesses. For example:\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s investment banking revenue, in the form of underwriting, placement and financial advisory fees, is directly related to the volume and value of transactions as well as the Company\u2019s role in these transactions. In an environment of uncertain or unfavorable market or economic conditions such as we have observed in recent years, the volume and size of capital-raising transactions and acquisitions and dispositions typically decrease, thereby reducing the demand for the Company\u2019s investment banking services and increasing price competition among financial services companies seeking such engagements. The completion of anticipated investment banking transactions in the Company\u2019s pipeline is uncertain and beyond its control, and its investment banking revenue is typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction. In most cases, the Company receives little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. For example, a client\u2019s acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or stockholder approvals, failure to secure necessary financing, adverse market conditions or unexpected financial or other problems in the client\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s business. If the parties fail to complete a transaction on which the Company is advising or an offering in which it is participating, the Company will earn little or no revenue from the transaction but may incur expenses including but not limited to legal fees. The Company may perform services subject to an engagement agreement and the client may refuse to pay fees due under such agreement, requiring the Company to re-negotiate fees or commence legal action for collection of such earned fees. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on market conditions, the decisions and actions of its clients and interested third parties. The number of engagements the Company has at any given time is subject to change and may not necessarily result in future revenues.\n\u2022\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from fees generated from its asset management business segment. Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and performance (or incentive) fees. Management fees are primarily based on assets under management. Assets under management balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and changes in market values. Poor investment performance by the Company\u2019s funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. If the Company experiences losses of managed accounts, fee revenue will decline. In addition, in periods of declining market values, the values under management may ultimately decline, which would negatively impact fee revenues.\n\u2022\nA downturn in the financial markets may result in a decline in the volume and value of trading transactions and, therefore, may lead to a decline in the revenue the Company generates from commissions on the execution of trading transactions and, in respect of its market-making activities, a reduction in the value of its trading positions and commissions and spreads. A further downturn could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue.\n\u2022\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events such as dislocations which may lead to reduced liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, the Company\u2019s risk management strategies may not be as effective as they might otherwise be under normal market conditions.\n\u2022\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s businesses. The Company\u2019s liquidity could be negatively affected by an inability to raise funding on a regular basis either in the short term market through bank borrowing or in the long term market through senior and subordinated borrowings. Such illiquidity could arise through a lowering of the Company\u2019s credit rating or through market disruptions unrelated to the Company. The availability of unsecured financing is largely dependent on our credit rating which is largely determined by factors such as the level and quality of our earnings, capital adequacy, risk management, asset quality and business mix. As noted above, the Company has purchased, and will continue to purchase, auction rate securities from its clients which will reduce liquidity available to the Company for other purposes. The failure to secure the liquidity necessary for the Company to operate and grow could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\" under Item 7.\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates (especially if such changes are rapid), high interest rates or uncertainty regarding the future direction of interest rates, may create a less favorable environment for certain of the Company\u2019s businesses, particularly its fixed income business, resulting in reduced business volume and reduced revenue.\n\u2022\nThe reduction of interest rates to all-time record lows has substantially reduced the interest profits available to the Company through its margin lending and has also reduced profit contributions from money fund products and sponsored FDIC-covered deposits. If interest rates remain at the current historical low levels until late 2015, as is forecasted by the Federal Reserve, or later, the Company\u2019s profitability will continue to be significantly negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nThe Company expects to continue to commit its own capital to engage in proprietary trading, investing and similar activities, and uncertain or unfavorable market or economic conditions may reduce the value of its positions, resulting in reduced revenue.\nThe cyclical nature of the economy and the financial services industry leads to volatility in the Company\u2019s operating margins, due to the fixed nature of a portion of compensation expenses and many non-compensation expenses, as well as the possibility that the Company will be unable to scale back other costs at an appropriate time to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions. As a result, the Company\u2019s financial performance may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nMarkets have experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of high volatility accompanied by reduced liquidity.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective. Severe market events have historically been difficult to predict, and significant losses could be realized in the wake of such events. The \"Flash Crash\" on May 6, 2010 was driven not by external economic events but by internal market dynamics and automated systems. Such events cannot be predicted nor can anyone, including the Company, predict the effectiveness of controls put in place to prevent such incidents. Increasingly, threats of terrorism and terrorist acts have disrupted markets and increased the perception of risk to the worldwide economy. Any such act or threat may impact markets, and consequently the Company\u2019s business, in an adverse manner.\nThe Company has experienced significant pricing pressure in areas of its business, which may impair its revenues and profitability.\nIn recent years the Company has experienced, and continues to experience, significant pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in debt and equity trading. In the fixed income market, regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency, leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins. In the equity market, the Company has experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions, and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading, which has created additional downward pressure on trading margins. The trend toward using alternative trading systems is continuing to grow, which may result in decreased commission and trading revenue, reduce the Company\u2019s participation in the trading markets and its ability to access market information, and lead to the creation of new and stronger competitors. Institutional clients also have pressured financial services firms to alter \u201csoft dollar\u201d practices under which brokerage firms bundle the cost of trade execution with research products and services. Some institutions are entering into arrangements that separate (or \"unbundle\") payments for research products or services from sales commissions. These arrangements have increased the competitive pressures on sales commissions and have affected the value the Company\u2019s clients place on high-quality research. Moreover, the Company\u2019s inability to reach agreement regarding the terms of unbundling arrangements with institutional clients who are actively seeking such arrangements could result in the loss of those clients, which would likely reduce the level of institutional commissions. The Company believes that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay, including reducing the number of brokerage firms they use, and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees, commissions or margins. Additional pressure on sales and trading revenue may impair the profitability of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company faces intense competition for qualified employees from other businesses in the financial services industry, and the performance of its business may suffer to the extent it is unable to attract and retain employees effectively, particularly given the relatively small size of the Company and its employee base compared to some of its competitors. The primary sources of revenue in each of the Company\u2019s business lines are commissions and fees earned on advisory and underwriting transactions and customer accounts managed by its employees, who are regularly recruited by other firms and in certain cases are able to\ntake their client relationships with them when they change firms. Experienced employees are regularly offered financial inducements by larger competitors to change employers, and thus competitors can de-stabilize the Company\u2019s relationship with valued employees. Some specialized areas of the Company\u2019s business are operated by a relatively small number of employees, the loss of any of whom could jeopardize the continuation of that business following the employee\u2019s departure.\nThe Company depends on its senior employees and the loss of their services could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent in large part upon the services of its senior executives and employees. Any loss of service of the CEO may adversely affect the business and operations of the Company. The Company maintains key man insurance on the life of its CEO. If the Company\u2019s senior executives or employees terminate their employment and the Company is unable to find suitable replacements in relatively short periods of time, its operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nUnderwriting and market-making activities may place capital at risk.\nThe Company may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, it is unable to sell securities it purchased as an underwriter at the anticipated price levels. As an underwriter, the Company is subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings it underwrites. Any such misstatement or omission could subject the Company to enforcement action by the SEC and claims of investors, either of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and reputation. As a market maker, the Company may own large positions in specific securities, and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if the Company\u2019s holdings were more diversified.\nIncreases in capital commitments in our proprietary trading, investing and similar activities increase the potential for significant losses.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations for a given period may be affected by the nature and scope of these activities and such activities will subject the Company to market fluctuations and volatility that may adversely affect the value of its positions, which could result in significant losses and reduce its revenues and profits. In addition, increased commitment of capital will expose the Company to the risk that a counter-party will be unable to meet its obligations, which could lead to financial losses that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. These activities may lead to a greater concentration of risk, which may cause the Company to suffer losses even when business conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry.\nIf the Company is unable to repay its outstanding indebtedness when due, its operations would be materially adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had liabilities of approximately $2.3 billion, a significant portion of which is collateralized by highly liquid and marketable government securities as well as marketable securities owned by customers. The Company cannot assure that its operations or the liquidation of collateral supporting such borrowings will generate funds sufficient to repay its existing debt obligations as they come due. The Company\u2019s failure to repay its indebtedness and make interest payments as required by its debt obligations would most likely have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may make strategic acquisitions of businesses, engage in joint ventures or divest or exit existing businesses, which could result in unforeseen expenses or disruptive effects on its business.\nFrom time to time, the Company may consider acquisitions of other businesses or joint ventures with other businesses. For example, on January 14, 2008, the Company acquired certain businesses from CIBC World Markets Corp. Any acquisition or joint venture that the Company determines to pursue will be accompanied by a number of risks. After the announcement or completion of an acquisition or joint venture, the Company\u2019s share price could decline if investors view the transaction as too costly or unlikely to improve the Company\u2019s competitive position. Costs or difficulties relating to such a transaction, including integration of products, employees, offices, technology systems, accounting systems and management controls, may be difficult to predict accurately and be greater than expected causing the Company\u2019s estimates to differ from actual results. The Company may be unable to retain key personnel after the transaction, and the transaction may impair relationships with customers and business partners. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits and synergies from the transaction as fully as expected or within the expected time frame. Divestitures or elimination of existing businesses or products could have similar effects. These difficulties could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, increase its expenses and adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to extensive securities regulation and the failure to comply with these regulations could subject it to penalties or sanctions.\nThe securities industry and the Company\u2019s business are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. The Company is also regulated by industry self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA, NFA, and the MSRB. The Company may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. The regulatory environment is subject to change and the Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other federal or state governmental regulatory authorities, or self-regulatory organizations. In response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the regulatory environment to which the Company is subjected is expected to further intensify as additional rules and regulations are adopted by the Company\u2019s regulators. These new regulations will likely increase costs related to compliance and may in other ways adversely affect the performance of the Company.\nOppenheimer is a broker-dealer and investment advisor registered with the SEC and is primarily regulated by FINRA. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business, including:\n\u2022\nsales methods and supervision;\n\u2022\ntrading practices among broker-dealers;\n\u2022\nemerging standards concerning fees and charges imposed on clients for fee-based programs;\n\u2022\nuse and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and Patriot Act compliance;\n\u2022\ncapital structure of securities firms;\n\u2022\ncompliance with lending practices (Regulation T);\n\u2022\nrecord keeping; and\n\u2022\nthe conduct of directors, officers and employees.\nCompliance with many of the regulations applicable to the Company involves a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be subject to varying interpretation. The requirements imposed by these regulations are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with the Company. New regulations will result in enhanced standards of duty on broker dealers in their dealings with their clients (fiduciary standards). Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit the Company\u2019s activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements, including those relating to principal trading. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA, which is the Company\u2019s primary regulatory agency. FINRA adopts rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern its members and conducts periodic examinations of member firms\u2019 operations. However, recently the SEC has significantly increased its direct oversight of registrants in areas that directly overlap with FINRA thereby increasing the Company\u2019s costs of compliance and increasing the risks associated with compliance with emerging standards.\nThe SEC has passed a requirement for custodians of securities on behalf of investment advisors, such as the Company, to conduct an annual \u201csurprise audit\u201d, in addition to the annual audit, and to issue an annual controls report to its clients, issued by a qualified accounting firm, describing its processes and controls affecting custody operations. A failure to conduct such an audit or issue the report with favorable findings could adversely affect a sizable portion of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nIf the Company is found to have violated any applicable regulations, formal administrative or judicial proceedings may be initiated against it that may result in:\n\u2022\ncensure;\n\u2022\nfine;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties, including treble damages in the case of insider trading violations;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of cease-and-desist orders;\n\u2022\nthe deregistration or suspension of our broker-dealer activities;\n\u2022\nthe suspension or disqualification of our officers or employees; or\n\u2022\nother adverse consequences.\nThe imposition of any of these or other penalties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For a more detailed description of the regulatory scheme under which the Company operates, see Item 1 under the caption \"Regulation\" and Item 7 under the caption \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulation.\"\nFailure to comply with net capital requirements could subject the Company to suspension or revocation by the SEC or suspension or expulsion by FINRA, the FCA and the SFC.\nOppenheimer and Freedom are subject to the SEC\u2019s Net Capital Rule which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. For a more detailed description of the regulatory scheme under which the Company operates, see Item 1 under the caption \"Net Capital Requirements.\" Failure to comply with net capital requirements could subject the Company to suspension or revocation by the SEC or suspension or expulsion by FINRA.\nIn addition, Oppenheimer Europe Ltd. and Oppenheimer Investments Asia Limited are regulated by the FCA of the United Kingdom and the SFC in Hong Kong, respectively. Failure of these entities to comply with net capital requirements could subject those entities to suspension or expulsion by their respective regulators.\nIf the Company violates the securities laws, or is involved in litigation in connection with a violation, the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany aspects of the Company\u2019s business involve substantial risks of liability. An underwriter is exposed to substantial liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws, and court decisions, including decisions with respect to underwriters\u2019 liability and limitations on indemnification of underwriters by issuers. For example, a firm that acts as an underwriter may be held liable for material misstatements or omissions of fact in a prospectus used in connection with the securities being offered or for statements made by its securities analysts or other personnel. In recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of litigation involving the securities industry, including class actions that seek substantial damages. The Company\u2019s underwriting activities will usually involve offerings of the securities of smaller companies, which often involve a higher degree of risk and are more volatile than the securities of more established companies. In comparison with more established companies, smaller companies are also more likely to be the subject of securities class actions, to carry directors and officers liability insurance policies with lower limits or not at all, and to become insolvent. In addition, in market downturns, claims tend to increase. Each of these factors increases the likelihood that an underwriter may be required to contribute to an adverse judgment or settlement of a securities lawsuit.\nIn the normal course of business, the Operating Subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker-dealer, as an employer and as a result of other business activities. In turbulent times such as in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically escalated. The Company has experienced an increase in such claims as a result of the recent worldwide credit disruptions, including the disruptions in the auction rate securities market in 2008. If the Company misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against it from pending or threatened claims, or if the Company is unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against it from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly, its financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. See Item 1A under the caption \"Risk Factors - The Company may continue to be adversely affected by the failure of the Auction Rate Securities Market,\" as well as Item 3 under the caption \"Legal Proceedings\" and Item 7 under the caption \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Environment - Other Regulatory Matters.\"\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nIf actual experience differs from management\u2019s estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company\u2019s accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed by the Company as critical accounting estimates, are those described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 appearing in Item 8. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and current facts and circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s assets arise from goodwill and intangibles recorded as a result of business acquisitions it has made. The Company is required to perform a test for impairment of such goodwill and intangible assets, at least annually. To the extent that there are continued declines in the markets and general economy, impairment may become more likely. If the test resulted in a write-down of goodwill and/or intangible assets, the Company would incur a significant loss. For further discussion of this risk, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 appearing in Item 8.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management policies and procedures may leave it exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk.\nThe policies and procedures the Company employs to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Some methods of risk management are based on the use of observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible. This information may not be accurate, complete, or up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. The Company cannot give assurances that its policies and procedures will effectively and accurately record and verify this information. See Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nThe Company seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal reporting systems. The Company believes that it effectively evaluates and manages the market, credit and other risks to which it is exposed. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s ability to manage risk exposure can never be completely or accurately predicted or fully assured. For example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments can have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in securities values, decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, higher volatility in earnings, increases in the Company\u2019s credit risk to customers as well as to third parties and increases in general systemic risk.\nCredit risk may expose the Company to losses caused by the inability of borrowers or other third parties to satisfy their obligations.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties include:\n\u2022\ntrading counterparties;\n\u2022\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nclearing agents;\n\u2022\nexchanges;\n\u2022\nclearing houses; and\n\u2022\nother financial intermediaries as well as issuers whose securities we hold.\nThese parties may default on their obligations owed to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. This default risk may arise, for example, from:\n\u2022\nholding securities of third parties;\n\u2022\nexecuting securities trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries; and\n\u2022\nextending credit to clients through bridge or margin loans or other arrangements.\nSignificant failures by third parties to perform their obligations owed to the Company could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and its ability to borrow in the credit markets.\nRisks related to insurance programs.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the use of a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including most significantly property and casualty,\ngeneral liability, workers\u2019 compensation, and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans funded by the Company, and certain errors and omissions liability, among others.\nWhile the Company endeavors to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to its assessment of risk, it is unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. The Company\u2019s business may be negatively affected if in the future its insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable. In addition, insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating the business.\nThe precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect employee misconduct may not be effective and the Company could be exposed to unknown and unmanaged risks or losses.\nThe Company runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. Misconduct by employees could include:\n\u2022\nemployees binding the Company to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks to the Company (rogue trading);\n\u2022\nemployee theft and improper use of Company or client property;\n\u2022\nemployees conspiring with third parties to defraud the Company;\n\u2022\nemployees hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities from the Company, including outside business activities that are undisclosed and may result in liability to the Company;\n\u2022\nthe improper use of confidential information; or\n\u2022\nemployee conduct outside of acceptable norms including harassment.\nThese types of misconduct could result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses to the Company including regulatory sanctions and serious harm to its reputation. The precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective. If employee misconduct does occur, the Company\u2019s business operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDefaults by another large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection and financial institutions including the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corporation, and American International Group, Inc. needed to accept substantial funding from the Federal government. In the fourth quarter of 2011, MF Global Holding Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection. In August 2012, Peregrine Financial Group, Inc. was declared bankrupt and placed in receivership. The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, or other relationships between these institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk\" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which the Company interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could affect the Company.\nThe failure of guarantors could adversely affect the pricing of securities and their trading markets.\nMonoline insurance companies, commercial banks and other insurers regularly issue credit enhancements to issuers in order to permit them to receive higher credit ratings than would otherwise be available to them. As a result, the failure of any of these guarantors could and would suddenly and immediately result in the depreciation in the price of the securities that have been guaranteed or enhanced by such entity. This failure could adversely affect the markets in general and the liquidity of the securities that are so affected. This disruption could create losses for holders of affected securities including the Company. In addition, rating agency downgrades of the debt or deposit or claims paying ability of these guarantors could result in a reduction in the prices of securities held by the Company which are guaranteed by such guarantors.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Recent disclosures of such incursions by foreign and domestic unauthorized agents aimed at large financial institutions reflect higher risks for all such institutions. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny,\nor expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its data centers and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to its operations. Despite its security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. The recent increase in the number of security breaches at large retailers, credit card companies, movie studios and others reflect higher risk for all companies handling sensitive client data. Any such breach could compromise its networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt its operations and the services the Company provides to customers, damage its reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in its products and services, which could adversely affect its business, revenues and competitive position.\nThe Company may be exposed to damage to its business or its reputation by Cybersecurity incidents.\nAs the World becomes more interconnected through the use of the internet and users rely more extensively on the internet for the transmission and storage of data, such information becomes more susceptible to incursion by hackers and other parties intent on stealing or destroying data on which the Company or our clients rely. These cybersecurity incidents have increased in number and severity and it is expected that these trends will continue. Should the Company be affected by such an incident, we would be exposed to legal liability, loss of reputation as well as increased costs related to protection of systems and providing relief to clients.\nThe Company has and continues to introduce systems and software to prevent any such incidents and increasingly reviews and increases its defenses to such issues through the use of various services, programs and outside vendors. It is impossible for the Company to know when or if such incidents may arise or the business impact of any such incident.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business operations that are conducted outside of the United States subject the Company to unique risks and potential loss.\nTo the extent the Company conducts business outside the United States, it is subject to risks including, without limitation, the risk that it will be unable to provide effective operational support to these business activities, the risk of non-compliance with foreign laws and regulations, the general economic and political conditions in countries where it conducts business and currency fluctuations. The Company operates in Israel, the United Kingdom, Isle of Jersey, Switzerland and China as well as through agents in Latin America. If the Company is unable to manage these risks relating to its foreign operations effectively, its reputation and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may face exposure for environmental liabilities in British Columbia, Canada.\nThe Company has received notice from the current owner of rural mountainous properties in Canada that the Company may be liable for environmental claims with respect to such properties and that designate it a potentially responsible party in remedial activities for the cleanup of waste sites under applicable statutes. The Company is believed to have held title to various properties near Panorama, British Columbia, Canada from October 1942 through August 1969 and to have engaged in mining and milling operations for some part of that period. The Company was originally incorporated in British Columbia, Canada in 1933, under the name Sheep Creek Gold Mines Limited. The Company underwent a series of name changes and continuances,\nincluding from British Columbia to Ontario, from Ontario to Canadian federal jurisdiction and then, in May 2009, from Canada to Delaware.\nThe Company currently believes that future environmental claims, if any, that may be asserted will not be material and that its potential liability for known environmental matters is not material. However, environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify. Applicable law may impose joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party for the cleanup.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Although management has established a disaster recovery plan there is no guarantee that such plan will allow the Company to operate without disruption if such an event was to occur and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company maintains disaster recovery sites to aid it in reacting to circumstances such as those described above. The fourth quarter of 2012 was impacted by Superstorm Sandy which occurred on October 29th causing the Company to vacate its two principal offices in downtown Manhattan and displaced 800 of the Company\u2019s employees including substantially all of its capital markets, operations and headquarters staff for in excess of 30 days. During the displacement period the Company successfully implemented its business continuity plan by relocating personnel from both of its downtown Manhattan locations into other branch offices and back-up facilities in the region. Other than the closure of the financial markets for two business days, the Company was able to successfully clear and settle open trades that took place prior to the storm and to get its trading, operations, technology, and other support functions mobilized to process business once the financial markets reopened. The plans and preparations for such eventualities including the sites themselves may not be adequate or effective for their intended purpose.\nThe effect of climate changes on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe Company is not directly affected by environmental legislation, regulation or international treaties. The Company is not involved in an industry which is significantly impacted by climate changes except as such changes may affect the general economy of the United States and the rest of the world. Severe weather conditions such as storms, snowfall, and other climatic events may affect one or more offices of the Company. In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused dislocation and disruption of the Company\u2019s operations. Any such event may materially impact the operations or finances of the Company. The Company maintains Disaster Recovery Plans and property insurance for such emergencies. A significant change in the climate of the World could affect the general growth in the economy, population growth and create other issues which will over time affect returns on financial instruments and thus the financial markets in general. It is impossible to predict such effects on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe downgrade of U.S. long term sovereign debt obligations and issues affecting the sovereign debt of European nations may adversely affect markets and other business.\nOn August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+. Credit agencies have also reduced the credit ratings of various sovereign nations, including Greece, Italy and France. While the ultimate impact of such action is inherently unpredictable, these downgrades could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions throughout the World, including, specifically, the United States. Moreover, the market\u2019s anticipation of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. Various types of financial markets, including, but not limited to, money markets, long-term or short-term fixed income markets, foreign exchange markets, commodities markets and equity markets may be adversely affected by these impacts. In addition, the cost and availability of funding and certain impacts, such as increased spreads in money market and other short term rates, have been experienced already as the market anticipated the downgrade.\nThe negative impact that may result from this downgrade or any future downgrade could adversely affect our credit ratings, as well as those of our clients and/or counterparties, and could require us to post additional collateral on loans collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The unprecedented nature of this and any future negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations will make any impact on our business, financial condition and liquidity unpredictable. In addition any such impact may not be immediately apparent.\nIn addition, global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by the ability of certain European Union (\"EU\") member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. The continued uncertainty over the outcome of the EU governments\u2019 financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets and may negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for an investor to resell shares of the Company\u2019s Class A non-voting common stock (the \"Class A Stock\") at the times and at the prices desired. The price of the Class A Stock can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory issues involving the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\na downturn in the overall economy or the equity markets in particular;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any of the other events described in these Risk Factors.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s Class A Stock is less than that of larger financial services companies.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s Class A Stock is listed for trading on the NYSE, the trading volume in its Class A Stock is less than that of larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Company\u2019s Class A Stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s Class A Stock, significant sales of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to fall and increase the volatility of the Class A Stock generally.\nThe holders of Class A Stock do not have the ability to vote on most corporate matters which limits the influence that these holders have over the Company.\nThe Company issues two classes of shares, Class A Stock and Class B voting common stock (\"Class B Stock\"). At December 31, 2014, there were 99,680 shares of Class B Stock outstanding compared to 13,530,688 shares of Class A Stock. The voting power associated with the Class B Stock allows holders of Class B Stock to effectively exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and other matters affecting the Company. Over 96% of the Class B voting shares are held by an entity controlled by Mr. Albert Lowenthal, the Chairman and CEO of the Company. Due to the lack of voting power, the Class A Stockholders have limited influence on corporate matters.\nThe Company\u2019s Chairman and CEO owns a significant portion of the Company\u2019s Class B voting stock and therefore can exercise significant control over the corporate governance and affairs of the Company, which may result in him taking actions with which other stockholders do not agree.\nAn entity controlled by the Company\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Albert Lowenthal, owns over 96% of the Class B voting stock. As a result, Mr. Lowenthal can exercise substantial influence over the outcome of most, if not of all corporate actions requiring approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which may result in corporate action with which other stockholders do not agree. This Class B voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or may result in the receipt of a \"control premium\" by the controlling stockholder which premium would not be received by the holders of the Class A Stock. The controlling stockholder may have potential conflicts of interest with other stockholders including the ability to determine the impact of \"say on pay\" provisions at the Company.\nPossible additional issuances of the Company\u2019s stock will cause dilution.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had 13,530,688 shares of Class A Stock outstanding, outstanding employee stock options to purchase a total of 45,549 shares of Class A Stock, as well as outstanding unvested stock awards granted for an additional 1,239,346 shares of Class A Stock. The Company is further authorized to issue up to 998,615 shares of Class A Stock under share-based compensation plans for which stockholder approval has already been obtained. As the Company issues additional shares, stockholders\u2019 holdings will be diluted, perhaps significantly. The issuance of any additional shares of Class A Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Class A Stock or that represent the right to receive Class A Stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our Class A Stock. Holders of our Class A Stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders. The market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Stock could decline as a result of sales or issuance of shares of Class A Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Class A Stock.", "PERMNO": 78451, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "OPY"}
