{"cik": "1731348", "company": "Tilray, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCareful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC or publicly in Canada, in evaluating our company and our business. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material may also materially and adversely affect our company and our business.\nRisks Related to the Arrangement\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the Arrangement could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price.\nThe completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions precedent, some of which are outside Aphria\u2019s and Tilray\u2019s control, including receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals.\nTo complete the Arrangement, each of Aphria and Tilray must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities. Aphria and Tilray have not yet obtained all of the regulatory approvals which are required to complete the Arrangement. The regulatory approval processes may take a lengthy period of time to complete, which could delay completion of the Arrangement. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the approval processes, including the undertakings and conditions that may be required for approval, or whether the regulatory approvals will be obtained at all.\nIn addition, the completion of the Arrangement by Aphria and Tilray is conditional on, among other things, no action or circumstance occurring that would result in a material adverse effect on Aphria\u2019s and Tilray\u2019s business operations, financial results and share price.\nThere can be no certainty, nor can Aphria or Tilray provide any assurance, that all conditions precedent to the Arrangement will be satisfied or waived, or, if satisfied or waived, when they will be satisfied or waived and, accordingly, the Arrangement may not be completed or may be delayed. If, for any reason, the Arrangement is not completed, its completion is materially delayed and/or the Arrangement Agreement is terminated, the market price of our shares of Class 2 common stock may be materially adversely affected. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could also be subject to various material adverse consequences, including that we would remain liable for costs relating to the Arrangement.\nIn addition, if the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, there are risks that the announcement of the Arrangement and the dedication of our resources to the completion thereof could have a negative impact on our relationships with our stakeholders and could have a material adverse effect on our current and future operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, we may incur significant transaction expenses in connection with the Arrangement, regardless of whether the Arrangement is completed.\nWe are subject to customary non-solicitation provisions under the Arrangement Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement also restricts us from taking specified actions until the Arrangement is completed without the consent of Aphria. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Arrangement.\nEach of the parties may terminate the Arrangement if the closing has not occurred by the outside date specified in the Arrangement Agreement, and in certain other circumstances.\nEach of Aphria and Tilray has the right in certain circumstances, in addition to termination rights relating to the failure to satisfy the conditions of closing, to terminate the Arrangement. Accordingly, there can be no certainty, nor can Tilray provide any assurance that the Arrangement will not be terminated by either Aphria or Tilray prior to the completion of the Arrangement. In addition, if the Arrangement is not completed by July 31, 2021, either Aphria or Tilray may choose to terminate the Arrangement Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement also includes termination amounts payable if the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.\nThe termination amounts provided under the Arrangement Agreement may discourage other parties from attempting to acquire Aphria or Tilray.\nUnder the Arrangement Agreement, each of Aphria and Tilray would be required to pay to the other a termination amount of C$65 million in the event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. This termination amount may discourage other parties from attempting to acquire Tilray or otherwise make an acquisition proposal to Tilray, even if those parties would be willing to offer our stockholders a benefit greater than what the Arrangement offers.\nThe transaction consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted.\nThe market price of shares of Aphria\u2019s common stock or shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock could each fluctuate significantly prior to the effective date of the Arrangement in response to various factors and events, including, without limitation, as a result of the differences between Aphria\u2019s and Tilray\u2019s actual financial or operating results and those expected by investors and analysts, changes in analysts\u2019 projections or recommendations, changes in general economic or market conditions, and broad market fluctuations. As a result of such fluctuations, historical market prices are not indicative of future market prices or the market value of the shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock that holders of shares of Aphria\u2019s common stock may receive on the effective date of the\nArrangement. There can be no assurance that the trading price of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock will not decline following the completion of the Arrangement.\nThe foregoing risks or other risks arising in connection with the Arrangement, including the potential failure of the Arrangement and the diversion of management attention from conducting the business of Aphria and Tilray, may have a material adverse effect on Aphria\u2019s and Tilray\u2019s business operations, financial results and share price.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nRisks related to COVID-19 have and will continue to impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in extended government-ordered closures affecting significant portions of the global economy, including in the United States, Canada, Portugal, and Germany, where we conduct significant business. The public health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the measures taken and continuing to be taken by governments, businesses and the public have, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, including our operations and the market for our securities and our financial condition, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. These include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak, and further action taken by the government and other third parties in response to the pandemic. In particular, COVID-19 and government efforts to curtail COVID-19 could impede our production facilities, increase operating expenses, result in loss of sales, affect our supply chains, impact performance of contractual obligations and require additional expenditures to be incurred.\nIn connection with COVID-19 and to comply with mandates and guidance from governmental authorities, we have and continue to update our operational procedures and safety protocols at our facilities. If such measures are not effective or governmental authorities implement further restrictions, we may be required to take more extreme action, which could include a short or long-term closure of our facilities or reduction in workforce. These measures may impair our production levels or cause us to close or severely limit production at one or more facilities. Further, our operations could be adversely impacted if suppliers, contractors, customers and/or transportation carriers are restricted or prevented from conducting business activities. For example, cannabis retail stores in certain Canadian markets may close voluntarily or be forced by local governments to close or modify their operations, reducing our ability to distribute adult-use cannabis.\nConsumer demand for cannabis products may also be impacted by COVID-19 as a result of reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income associated with layoffs, and work or pay limitations due to mandatory social distancing and lockdown measures implemented by government authorities. Demand for medical cannabis may be further impacted due to a decrease in patients visiting doctor\u2019s offices and clinics. As demand for our products decreases, we may be required to record additional asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill, along with other accounting charges.\nThe following is a summary of certain COVID-19 related operational impacts and associated risks at our production and processing facilities:\n\u2022\nTo date, the province of Ontario, where we grow and manufacture adult-use cannabis and other cannabis products, has deemed our supply chain operations to be an essential service; however, there can be no assurance that such designation will remain in effect. If our growing and manufacturing operations at Enniskillen and London, Ontario are deemed non-essential, and are required to close for a significant period of time, our revenues and our results of operations would be significantly reduced.\n\u2022\nSimilarly, the province of British Columbia, where we grow and manufacture cannabis products for medicinal purposes, has explicitly deemed the manufacture and sale of adult-use and medicinal cannabis by Licensed Producers (as defined under the Cannabis Act) to be an essential service. Any change to such\ndesignation could further disrupt our medicinal cannabis production and sales and restrict our ability to participate in clinical trials.\n\u2022\nManitoba Harvest has production facilities in Winnipeg and Ste. Agathe, which produce hemp-related food products and accordingly have been deemed essential. While our facilities at both Winnipeg and Ste. Agathe remain open and producing according to schedule, and the U.S./Canadian border closure has exempted food transport as an essential cross-border service, we cannot predict the effect of future governmental actions related to COVID-19 on this critical supply chain. If our manufacturing operations at Winnipeg and Ste. Agathe are deemed non-essential, and are required to close for a significant period of time, or the U.S.-Canadian border is closed to food transport, our general ability to transport and receive raw materials, inputs and final products would be significantly impacted.\n\u2022\nWhile our facility in Portugal has not been subject to a mandatory closure by Portuguese authorities, there can be no assurance that such operational status will remain in effect or that the government will not implement additional measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. If the government mandated closure of our Portugal facility, or otherwise ordered further restrictions to business activities or employees\u2019 movement, it could affect our ability to export medicinal cannabis across the European Union, applicable member states, or elsewhere in the region, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are completing construction of an additional greenhouse of 3.4 hectares in Cantanhede, Portugal, currently scheduled for final completion by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Due to COVID-19, we have and may continue to experience construction delays. If we are unable to complete construction in a timely manner due to COVID-19, we may not achieve all our expected harvests and production, which may negatively impact our international sales. While we are actively working with our contractors to maintain appropriate COVID-19 protections at our construction site in an effort to complete construction in a timely manner, we may experience further delays as a result of the pandemic.\n\u2022\nIn Germany, we have experienced minimal disruption in the supply of medicinal products to patients via pharmacies and physicians. However, COVID-19 may impact ongoing supply and patient demand. We have observed a strong decrease in patients visiting doctors\u2019 offices since the pandemic was declared, which could lead to reduced patient demand and revenues. Additionally, if medicinal cannabis is deemed non-essential by the German government, or we are unable to import our medicinal products into Germany from Canada and Portugal, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature and significance of COVID-19 and its impact globally, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business. Any of the negative impacts of COVID-19, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the other risk factors outlined in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nRisks Related to Adult-Use Cannabis\nThe development of the adult-use cannabis industry and regulations governing this industry may impact our ability to successfully compete.\nThe Cannabis Act and the accompanying regulations, or the CR, became effective in October 2018 and allow individuals over the age of 18 to legally purchase, process and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for adult use recreational purposes in Canada. Further, each province and territory of Canada has the ability to separately regulate the distribution of cannabis within such province or territory, and the rules (including associated regulations) adopted by these provinces or territories vary significantly. There is no assurance that the adult-use cannabis industry, and the regulations governing this industry, will continue to develop as anticipated.\nThere are and will be significant restrictions on the marketing, branding, product formats, product composition, packaging, and distribution channels allowed under the CR, which may reduce the value of certain of our products and brands or negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in the adult-use cannabis market in Canada. For instance, the CR includes a requirement for health warnings on product packaging, the\nlimited ability to use logos and branding (only one brand name and one brand element per package), restrictions on packaging itself, and restrictions on types and avenues of marketing. Further, Cannabis 2.0 regulations (which came into force on October 17, 2019, allowing new cannabis form factors) govern the production and sale of new classes or forms of cannabis products (including vapes and edibles), and impose considerable restrictions on product composition, labeling, and packaging in addition to being subject to similar marketing restrictions as existing form factors. Additional marketing and product composition restrictions have been imposed by some provinces and territories. Such federal and provincial restrictions may impair our ability to develop our adult-use brands and additional product or marketing restrictions imposed under future regulations may make it uneconomic or unfeasible for us to introduce our entire portfolio of brands and products into the Canadian market, which means that we may be unable to reap the full benefit of the exclusive rights we have secured to such brands and products or launch new products.\nSome provinces and territories also impose significant restrictions on our ability to merchandise products; for example, some provinces impose restrictions on investment in retailers or distributors and their employees as well as in our ability to negotiate for preferential retail space or in-store marketing. Such variance may make participation in the adult-use cannabis market uneconomic or of limited economic benefit for us in those provinces or territories and could result in significant additional compliance or other costs and limitations on our ability to compete successfully in each such market.\nAccess to certain markets in Canada is dependent on compliance with supplier standards established by provincial or territorial distributors\nGovernment-run provincial and territorial distributors in Canada require suppliers to meet certain service and business standards, and routinely assess for compliance with such standards. Any failure by us to comply with such standards could result in our being downgraded or disqualified as a supplier and would severely impede or eliminate our ability to access certain markets within Canada. See Risk Factor \u201cWe depend on significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or significant customers reduce their purchases, our revenue could decline significantly.\u201d\nThe adult-use cannabis market in Canada is continuing to develop and may experience supply fluctuations which could result in decreases to prices and revenues.\nAs a result of the legalization in October 2018 of adult-use cannabis for recreational purposes in Canada, the market for adult-use cannabis is continuing to develop, resulting in fluctuations in supply and demand. Licensed Producers, and others licensed to produce cannabis under the CR, may not be able to produce enough cannabis to meet adult-use demand. This may result in lower than expected sales and revenues and may result in increased competition for sales and sources of supply. This competition may adversely affect our adult-use business and there is no guarantee that we will be able to supply or acquire the supply, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, to meet the demand for medical and adult-use cannabis.\nIn addition, we and other cannabis producers in Canada may produce more cannabis than is needed to satisfy the collective demand of the Canadian medical and adult-use markets, and we may be unable to export that oversupply into other legal markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we incurred inventory valuation adjustments of approximately $38.4 million. As a result, the available supply of cannabis could exceed demand, resulting in a significant decline in the market price for cannabis. If this were to occur, there is no assurance that we would be able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of adult-use cannabis to result in profitability and sufficient liquidity. Regulatory restrictions or over supply conditions in our primary markets could result in inventory adjustments.\nCompetition from the illicit cannabis market could impact our ability to succeed.\nWe face competition from unlicensed and unregulated market participants, including illegal dispensaries and illicit market suppliers selling cannabis and cannabis-based products in Canada.\nDespite the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada, illicit market operations remain abundant and are a substantial competitor to our business. In addition, illegal dispensaries and illicit market participants may be able to (i) offer products with higher concentrations of active ingredients that are either expressly prohibited or impracticable to produce under current Canadian regulations, (ii) brand products more explicitly, and (iii) describe/discuss intended effects of products. As these illicit market participants do not comply\nwith the regulations governing the medical and adult-use cannabis industry in Canada, their operations frequently have significantly lower costs.\nAs a result of the competition presented by the illicit market for cannabis, any unwillingness by consumers currently utilizing these unlicensed distribution channels to begin purchasing from licensed retailers for any reason or any inability or unwillingness of law enforcement authorities to enforce laws prohibiting the unlicensed cultivation and sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products could (i) result in the perpetuation of the illicit market for cannabis, (ii) adversely affect our market share and (iii) adversely impact the public perception of cannabis use and licensed cannabis producers and dealers, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Furthermore, given the restrictions on regulated cannabis retail, including those related to COVID-19, it is possible that legal cannabis consumers revert to the illicit market as a matter of convenience.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop new products or commercialize such products.\nCannabis 2.0, regulations, which came into effect on October 17, 2019, permit Licensed Producers to develop new cannabis form factors, including CBD and THC-infused drinks, edibles and non-flower products, such as vapes. We have and will continue to develop strategic partnerships to participate in these new product market opportunities with partners who can provide complementary product development and support capabilities. Strategic initiatives around new products involve significant investment of management time and resources in order to successfully execute and maintain, for novel products that may not generate sufficient market demand. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that such new product offerings, even if successfully developed, will have unit economics that generate an appropriate return on investment. The development of new products could result in diversions of management attention, a strain on existing financial and other resources or a lack of product demand for our newly developed form factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur vape business is subject to uncertainty in the evolving vape market due to negative public sentiment and regulatory scrutiny.\nCannabis vape products in Canada are regulated under the Cannabis Act and the CR, as well as the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. The CR sets clear rules and standards for the manufacture, composition, packaging, and marketing of cannabis vape products. Health risks raised in Canada and the United States associated with vaping and accompanying negative public sentiment may prompt Health Canada or individual provinces/territories to further limit or defer industry\u2019s ability to sell cannabis vape products and may also diminish consumer demand for such products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet any additional compliance requirements or regulatory restrictions, or remain competitive in the face of unexpected changes in market conditions.\nVaping, electronic cigarettes and related products were recently developed and therefore the scientific community has not yet had a sufficient period of time to study the long-term health effects of their use. Currently, there is no way of knowing whether these products are safe for their intended use and the medical community is still studying these products\u2019 health effects. If the scientific community were to determine conclusively that use of any or all of these products poses long-term health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline. Such a determination could also lead to litigation and significant regulation.\nLoss of demand for our products, product liability claims and increased regulation stemming from unfavorable scientific studies on cannabis vaping products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe adult-use cannabis industry in Canada is subject to many of the same risks as the medical cannabis industry, including risks related to our need for regulatory approvals, the early status and uncertain growth of this industry and the competition we expect to face in this industry.\nThe adult-use cannabis industry in Canada is subject to certain risks that are unique to this industry, as well as the risks that are currently applicable to the medical cannabis industry, which are described under the heading above titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Medical Cannabis Business.\u201d\nIf any of these shared risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected in a number of ways, which may include being unable to successfully compete in the\nadult-use cannabis industry or being subject to fines, damage awards and other penalties as a result of regulatory infractions or other claims brought against us.\nCompetition in the legal adult-use cannabis market in Canada may impact our ability to succeed in this market.\nOur Canadian adult-use business faces enhanced competition from other Licensed Producers, those individuals and corporations who are licensed under the CR to participate in the adult-use cannabis industry and those that have applied for licenses under the CR. Moreover, the CR allows individuals to cultivate, propagate, harvest and distribute up to four cannabis plants per household, provided that each plant meets certain requirements. If we are unable to effectively compete with other suppliers to the adult-use cannabis market, or a significant number of individuals take advantage of the ability to cultivate and use their own cannabis, our success in the adult-use business may be limited and may not fulfill the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors.\nCertain of our competitors have significantly greater financial, production, marketing, research and development, and technical and human resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be more successful than us in gaining market penetration and market share. Our commercial opportunity in the adult-use market could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors produce and commercialize products for the adult-use market that, among other things, are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than the products that we may produce, have greater sales, marketing and distribution support than our products, enjoy enhanced timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness advantages over our products and receive more favorable publicity than our products. If our adult-use products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the adult-use market, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and our adult-use business may not become profitable.\nThere may be industry consolidation of one or more competitors, which could increase the competitive advantage of certain competitors and reduce overall market share opportunities. Increased consolidation and new and disparate provincial regulations could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Medical Cannabis Business\nOur medical cannabis business is dependent upon regulatory approvals and licenses, ongoing compliance and reporting obligations, and timely renewals.\nOur ability to grow, process, package, store and sell cannabis products for medical purposes in Canada is dependent on our current Health Canada licenses under the CR, covering our production facility and patient call center at our Tilray North America Campus in Nanaimo, British Columbia, or Tilray Nanaimo. These licenses allow us to produce cannabis in bulk and finished forms at these facilities and to sell and distribute such cannabis in Canada. They also allow us to export medical cannabis in bulk and finished form to and from specified jurisdictions around the world, subject to obtaining, for each specific shipment, an export approval from Health Canada and an import approval (or no objection notice) from the applicable regulatory authority in the country to or from which the export or import is being made. These CR licenses are valid for fixed periods and will need to be renewed at the end of such periods.\nWe also hold licenses under the CR covering our facilities in Enniskillen and London, Ontario which we use to service the adult-use market and support the medical market as needed. These licenses allow us to produce, sell, and distribute cannabis and/or cannabis products in Canada. These licenses are valid for fixed periods and will need to be renewed at the end of such periods.\nOur ability to operate in our facility at our Tilray European Union Campus located in Cantanhede, Portugal, or Tilray Portugal, is dependent on our current authorization for the cultivation, import and export of cannabis and our Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, certification by the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products, or INFARMED, for manufacture of cannabis as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, and is dependent on our current authorization for the manufacture of finished cannabis products and GMP certification for manufacture of cannabis as a finished medicinal product. Our GMP certification issued in May 2020 allows the facility to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, including dried flower and oils. Our current authorization for cultivation, import and export of cannabis, which includes a new cultivation site located in Reguengos de Monsaraz as of June 1, 2020, is valid for a single growing season at a time and notification to INFARMED is needed to renew the license for subsequent growing seasons. All licenses are subject to ongoing compliance and reporting requirements and renewal.\nAny future medical cannabis production facilities that we operate in Canada or elsewhere will also be subject to separate licensing requirements under the CR or applicable local legal requirements. Although we believe that we will meet the requirements of the CR for future renewals of our existing licenses, and grants of permits under such licenses, and to obtain corresponding licenses for any future facilities in Canada, there can be no assurance that existing licenses will be renewed or new licenses obtained on the same or similar terms as our existing licenses, nor can there be any assurance that Health Canada will continue to issue import or export permits on the same terms or on the same timeline, or that other countries will allow, or continue to allow, imports or exports.\nFurther, we are subject to ongoing inspections by Health Canada and INFARMED to monitor our compliance with their licensing requirements. Most recently, our facilities received fully compliant inspection or compliance verification ratings on the following dates: Tilray Canada Ltd. (February 2020), High Park Holdings Ltd. (May 2020) and High Park Farms Ltd. (November 2020). Our existing licenses and any new licenses that we may obtain in the future in Canada or other jurisdictions may be revoked or restricted at any time in the event that we are found not to be in compliance. Should we fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements or with conditions set out under our licenses, should our licenses not be renewed when required, be renewed on different terms, or be revoked, we may not be able to continue producing or distributing medical cannabis in Canada or other jurisdictions or to export medical cannabis outside of Canada or Portugal. In addition, we may be subject to enforcement proceedings resulting from a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in Canada or other jurisdictions, which could result in damage awards, a suspension of our existing approvals, a withdrawal of our existing approvals, the denial of the renewal of our existing approvals or any future approvals, recalls of products, product seizures, the imposition of future operating restrictions on our business or operations or the imposition of civil, regulatory or criminal fines or penalties against us, our officers and directors and other parties. These enforcement actions could delay or entirely prevent us from continuing the production, testing, marketing, sale or distribution of our medical products and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business operations.\nGovernment regulation is evolving, and unfavorable changes could impact our ability to carry on our business as currently conducted and the potential expansion of our business.\nThe successful execution of our medical cannabis business objectives is contingent upon compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements in Canada (including the Cannabis Act and CR), Europe and other jurisdictions, and obtaining all other required regulatory approvals for the production, sale, import and export of our medical cannabis products. The commercial medical cannabis industry is a relatively new industry in Canada and the federal regulatory regime has only been in effect in its current form since October 2018. The effect of Health Canada\u2019s administration, application and enforcement of the regime established by the Cannabis Act and CR on us and our business in Canada, and the administration, application and enforcement of the laws of other countries by the appropriate regulators in those countries, may significantly delay or impact our ability to participate in the Canadian medical cannabis market or medical cannabis markets outside Canada, to develop medical cannabis products and produce and sell these medical cannabis products.\nFurther, Health Canada or the regulatory authorities in other countries in which we operate or to which we export our medical cannabis products may change their administration or application of the applicable regulations or their compliance or enforcement procedures at any time. The laws and regulations in Canada may change both federally and provincially, with new regulations introduced or changes to existing regulations, which could include additional restrictions. The applicable laws in other countries where we operate or export our medical cannabis products are subject to similar changes. Any such changes could require us to revise our ongoing compliance procedures, incur increased compliance costs and expend additional resources. There is no assurance that we will be able to comply or continue to comply with applicable regulations, which could impact our ability to continue to carry on business as currently conducted and the potential expansion of our business.\nWe are subject to compliance with additional regulatory and other requirements in order to produce and sell in, or export our medical cannabis products to, jurisdictions outside of Canada.\nWe are required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses or other approvals from regulatory agencies in countries and markets outside of Canada in which we operate, or to which we export, to produce or export to, and sell our medical products in, these countries, including, in the case of certain countries, the ability to demonstrate compliance with GMP standards. Our current certification of compliance with GMP standards for\nproduction at Tilray Nanaimo and Tilray Portugal and any other GMP certification that we may receive in the future subject us, or will in the future subject us, to extensive ongoing compliance reviews to ensure that we continue to maintain compliance with current GMP standards. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these standards. Moreover, future governmental actions in countries where we operate, or export medical cannabis products, may limit or altogether restrict the import and/or export of cannabis for medical purposes.\nThe continuation or expansion of our international operations depends on our ability to renew or secure necessary permits, licenses and other approvals. An agency\u2019s denial of or delay in issuing or renewing a permit, license or other approval, or revocation or substantial modification of an existing permit, license or approval, could prevent us from continuing our operations in, marketing efforts in, or exporting to countries other than Canada. In addition, the export and import of medical cannabis is subject to United Nations treaties establishing country-by-country national estimates and our export and import permits are subject to these estimates which could limit the amount of medical cannabis we can export to any particular country.\nThe long-term effect of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada on the medical cannabis industry is unknown, and may negatively impact our medical cannabis business.\nAccording to recent Canadian government statistics, medicinal cannabis patient numbers continue to experience decline. A continued decrease in the overall size of the medical cannabis market in Canada as a result of the legal adult-use market or other factors may reduce our medical sales and revenue prospects in Canada. Factors that may influence demand for medical cannabis include the availability of product in each market, the price of medical cannabis products in relation to similar adult-use cannabis products, and the ease with which each market can be accessed in the individual provinces and territories of Canada. The impact of adult-use cannabis on the medical market is not yet fully understood as the market is still in a state of flux. In addition, the impact of the new form factors, legalized in October 2019, on the medical vs adult-use market is not yet established.\nThe regulation of cannabis for medical purposes under the CR is expected to be reviewed in light of the adult-use market, which review is scheduled to commence in October 2021. The effect on our business, and the medical cannabis market in general, of such a review is uncertain.\nResearch regarding the health effects of medical cannabis in relatively early stages and subject to further study which could impact demand for our medical cannabis products.\nResearch regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy and dosing of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC) remains in relatively early stages. There have been few clinical trials on the benefits of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids conducted by us or by others. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to statements contained in the articles, reports and studies we have relied on or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing or other facts and perceptions related to medical cannabis, which could adversely affect social acceptance of cannabis and the demand for our products.\nOur production and processing facilities are integral to our business and adverse changes or developments affecting any of these facilities may have an adverse impact on our business.\nCurrently, our activities and resources are primarily focused on the operation of Tilray Nanaimo, High Park Farms and the High Park Processing Facility, Tilray Portugal and Manitoba Harvest. Tilray Nanaimo, High Park Farms and our High Park Processing Facility each have a site-specific license issued by Health Canada under the CR. Adverse changes or developments affecting any of these facilities, including, but not limited to, disease or infestation of our crops, a fire, an explosion, a power failure, a natural disaster, an epidemic, pandemic or other public health crisis, or a material failure of our security infrastructure, could reduce or require us to entirely suspend our production of cannabis. See also, \u201cRisks related to COVID-19\u201d.\nA significant failure of our site security measures and other facility requirements, including any failure to comply with regulatory requirements under the CR, could have an impact on our ability to continue operating under our Health Canada licenses and our prospects of renewing our licenses, and could also result in a suspension or revocation of these Health Canada licenses. As we produce much of our medical cannabis products in Tilray Nanaimo, any event impacting our ability to continue production at Tilray Nanaimo, or requiring us to delay\nproduction, would prevent us from continuing to operate our business until operations at Tilray Nanaimo could be resumed, or until we were able to commence production at another facility.\nWe are currently expanding our Tilray Portugal facilities. We expect the expanded facilities will significantly increase our cultivation, growing, processing and distribution capacity; however, development impediments such as construction delays or cost over-runs in respect to the development of these facilities, howsoever caused, could delay or prevent our ability to produce cannabis at these facilities. It is also possible that the final costs of the major equipment contemplated by our capital expenditure program relating to the development of Tilray Portugal may be significantly greater than anticipated, in which circumstance we may be required to curtail, or extend the timeframes for completing, such capital expenditure plans which would reduce our production capacity.\nIf we are unsuccessful in scaling operations at our facilities, we may become increasingly reliant on third-party cannabis suppliers, potentially at higher prices than our own cost to produce, which would have a negative impact on gross profit margins.\nThe medical cannabis industry and market are relatively new and evolving, which could impact our ability to succeed in this industry and market.\nWe are operating our current business in a relatively new medical cannabis industry and market, and our success depends on our ability to attract and retain patients. In addition to being subject to general business risks applicable to a business involving an agricultural product and a regulated consumer product, we need to continue to build brand awareness of our Tilray brand in the medical cannabis industry and make significant investments in our business strategy and production capacity. These investments include introducing new products into the markets in which we operate, adopting quality assurance protocols and procedures, building our international presence and undertaking regulatory compliance efforts. These activities may not promote our medical products as effectively as intended, or at all, and we expect that our competitors will undertake similar investments to compete with us for market share. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, patient requirements, healthcare practitioner prescribing practices, and spending patterns in this industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique characteristics that differ from other existing industries and markets and that cause our efforts to further our business to be unsuccessful or to have undesired consequences. As a result, we may not be successful in our efforts to attract and retain patients or to develop new medical cannabis products and produce and distribute these medical cannabis products to the markets in which we operate or to which we export in time to be effectively commercialized, or these activities may require significantly more resources than we currently anticipate in order to be successful.\nWe face intense competition, and anticipate competition will increase, which could hurt our business.\nWe face, and we expect to continue to face, intense competition from Licensed Producers and other potential competitors, some of which have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we have. In addition, it is possible that the medical cannabis industry will undergo consolidation, creating larger companies with financial resources, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and product offerings that are greater than ours. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain our operations or develop them as currently proposed, on terms we consider acceptable, or at all.\nHealth Canada has issued hundreds of licenses for Licensed Producers. The number of licenses granted and the number of Licensed Producers ultimately authorized by Health Canada could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for market share in Canada\u2019s medical cannabis industry. We expect to face additional competition from new market entrants that are granted licenses under the CR or existing license holders that are not yet active in the industry. If a significant number of new licenses are granted by Health Canada, we may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward price pressure on our medical cannabis products as new entrants increase production.\nIn addition, the CR permits patients in Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or to designate a person to produce a limited amount of cannabis on their behalf for such purposes. Widespread reliance upon this allowance could reduce the current or future consumer demand for our medical cannabis products.\nIf the number of users of cannabis for medical purposes in Canada increases, the demand for products will increase. This could result in the competition in the medical cannabis industry becoming more intense as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified medical cannabis products. Conversely, if there is a contraction in the medical market for cannabis in Canada, competition for market share may increase. To remain competitive, we intend to continue to invest in research and development and sales and patient support; however, we may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development and sales and patient support efforts on a competitive basis.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the legal landscape for medical cannabis use is changing internationally. We have operations outside of Canada, which may be affected as other countries develop, adopt and change their medical cannabis laws. Increased international competition, including competition from suppliers in other countries who may be able to produce at lower cost, and limitations placed on us by Canadian or other regulations, might lower the demand for our medical cannabis products on a global scale.\nGeneral Business Risks and Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe began operating in 2014 and have yet to generate a profit. We generated a net loss of $271.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and net losses of $321.2 million, $67.7 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was $730.1 million as of December 31, 2020. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to explore potential opportunities and complete strategic mergers and acquisitions, invest in research and development, expand our marketing and sales operations and meet the compliance requirements as a public company.\nOur efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other unknown events. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the growth of our future expenses and our ability to generate revenue. If we continue to incur losses in the future, the net losses and negative cash flows incurred to date, together with any such future losses, will have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with producing and selling cannabis products, as outlined herein, we are unable to accurately predict when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our Class 2 common stock may significantly decrease and our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations may be impaired.\nWe are subject to litigation, arbitration and demands, which could result in significant liability and costs, and impact our resources and reputation.\nWe have been named as a defendant in a class action relating to the merger of Privateer Holdings, Inc. with and into our wholly owned subsidiary (referred to as the Downstream Merger), a class action related to the drop in our stock price, and other litigation and demands relating to business decisions, regulatory and industry changes, supply relationships, and our business acquisition matters and related activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Both the Company and its subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to these actions. Responding to such actions could divert management\u2019s attention away from our business operations and result in substantial costs. For more information on our pending legal proceedings, see \u201cPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to the laws of various countries as a result of our international operations.\nWe currently conduct operations in multiple countries and plan to expand these international operations. As a result of our operations, we are exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks and uncertainties associated with operating in or exporting to these jurisdictions. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in the laws, regulations and policies governing the production, sale and use of cannabis and cannabis-based products, political instability, instability at the United Nations level, currency controls, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and rates of inflation, labor unrest, changes in taxation laws, regulations and policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation and changing political conditions and governmental regulations relating to foreign investment and the cannabis business more generally.\nChanges, if any, in the laws, regulations and policies relating to the advertising, production, sale and use of cannabis and cannabis-based products or in the general economic policies in these jurisdictions, or shifts in political attitude related thereto, may adversely affect the operations, or profitability of our operations, in these countries. As we explore novel business models, such as global co-branded products, cannabinoid clinics and cannabis retail, international regulations will become increasingly challenging to manage. Specifically, our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on advertising, production, price controls, export controls, controls on currency remittance, increased income taxes, restrictions on foreign investment, land and water use restrictions and government policies rewarding contracts to local competitors or requiring domestic producers or vendors to purchase supplies from a particular jurisdiction. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices could result in additional taxes, costs, civil or criminal fines or penalties or other expenses being levied on our international operations, as well as other potential adverse consequences such as the loss of necessary permits or governmental approvals.\nFurthermore, although we have begun production at Tilray Portugal with a view toward facilitating exports of our cannabis products to countries in the EU (or, as permissible, elsewhere) from Portugal rather than from Canada, there is no assurance that these EU (or non-EU) countries will authorize the import of our cannabis products from Portugal, or that Portugal will authorize or continue to authorize such exports, or that such exports will provide us with advantages over our current EU export strategy. Each country in the EU (or elsewhere) may impose restrictions or limitations on imports that require the use of, or confer significant advantages upon, producers within that particular country. As a result, we may be required to establish production facilities similar to Tilray Portugal in one or more countries in the EU (or elsewhere) where we wish to distribute our cannabis products in order to take advantage of the favorable legislation offered to producers in these countries.\nA renewal/prolongation of our GMP license in Germany is a precondition to allow import, distribution and sale of the Tilray product portfolio in the German market, and any failure to achieve such renewal could have a material impact on our business.\nWe face risks associated with our expansion into new markets outside of the current jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nWe plan in the future to expand our operations and business into jurisdictions outside of the jurisdictions where we currently carry on business. There can be no assurance that any market for our products will develop in any such foreign jurisdiction. We may face new or unexpected risks or significantly increase our exposure to one or more existing risk factors, including economic instability, new competition, changes in laws and regulations, including the possibility that we could be in violation of these laws and regulations as a result of such changes, and the effects of competition. These factors may limit our capability to successfully expand our operations in, or export our products to, to such jurisdictions.\nWe may be unable to sustain our revenue growth and development, and may be forced to adjust our operations accordingly.\nOur revenue has grown in recent years. Our ability to sustain this growth will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the availability of sufficient capital on suitable terms, changes in laws and regulations respecting the production and distribution of cannabis products, competition from other Licensed Producers, the size of the illicit market, the size of the Canadian adult-use market, and our ability to produce sufficient volumes of our cannabis-based products to meet demand. Regulatory changes in the United States, Germany and Canada may continue to attract market entrants, therefore diluting our potential\nopportunity and early-mover advantage. In addition, we are subject to a variety of business risks generally associated with developing companies. Future development and expansion could place significant strain on our management personnel and likely will require us to recruit additional management personnel, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nDuring 2020, we implemented significant cost-control measures in reaction to the intense competitive environment, as well as other cannabis industry challenges. These measures included employee furloughs and lay-offs, brand and product portfolio prioritization and production facility closures. It is possible that we may take additional cost-control measures in the future that may slow our revenue growth and development, and could result in material charges and other impairment charges in our statement of operations.\u202f\u202f\nMarket consolidation in the cannabis industry may reduce our ability to compete, due to scale, cost and pricing disadvantages.\nThe Canadian cannabis industry may experience consolidation, and some of the resulting companies that will be our competitors will have market presence, growth operations, technical and marketing capabilities, personnel, financial and other resources substantially greater than our own. In addition, some of these competitors will be able to raise capital at a lower cost than we will be able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their growth, distribution and retail infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some of our current and future competitors or competitive price pressure may require us to lower prices in order to retain or acquire customers. Finally, the cost advantages of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time or achieve a greater return.\nOur business is subject to a variety of local and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. In the United States, despite cannabis having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult-use in a number of states, cannabis meeting the statutory definition of \u201cmarihuana\u201d continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, or the CSA, and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or the CSIEA. Hemp and marijuana both originate from the Cannabis sativa plant and CBD is a constituent of both. \u201cMarihuana\u201d or \u201cmarijuana\u201d is defined in the CSA as a Schedule I controlled substance whereas \u201cHemp\u201d is essentially any parts of the Cannabis sativa plant that has not been determined to be marijuana. Pursuant to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, or the Farm Bill, \u201chemp,\u201d or cannabis and cannabis derivatives containing no more than 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is now excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cmarijuana\u201d and, as such, is no longer a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Our activity in the United States is limited to (a) certain corporate and administrative services, including accounting, legal and creative services, (b) supply of study drug for clinical trials under DEA and FDA authorization, and (c) participation in the market for hemp and hemp-derived products containing CBD in compliance with the Farm Bill; except as described above, we do not produce or distribute cannabis products in the United States. Therefore, we believe we are not currently subject to the CSA or CSIEA.\nWe have commercialized in the United States a variety of hemp products, which might include certain cannabinoids including CBD, but would exclude THC at amounts more than 0.3%. While the Farm Bill exempted hemp and hemp derived products from the CSA, any such product commercialization will be subject to various laws, including the Farm Bill, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&CA, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, or DSHEA, applicable state and/or local laws, and FDA regulations. The FDA has stated in guidance and other public statements that it is prohibited to sell a food, beverage or dietary supplement to which THC or CBD has been added. While the FDA does not have a formal policy of enforcement discretion with respect to any products with added CBD, the agency has stated that its primary focus for enforcement centers on products that put the health and safety of consumers at risk, such as those claiming to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or cure diseases in the absence of requisite approvals. While the agency\u2019s enforcement to date has therefore focused on products containing CBD and that make drug-like claims, there is the risk that the FDA could expand its enforcement activities and require us to alter our marketing for our hemp-derived CBD products or cease\ndistributing them altogether. Nevertheless, the regulation of hemp and CBD in the United States has been a constantly evolving and changing landscape, with changes in federal and state laws and regulation occurring on a frequent basis. Violations of applicable FDA and other laws could result in warning letters, significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, injunctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings.\nWe are further subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Canada and elsewhere that prohibit money laundering, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada) and the Money Laundering Control Act (United States), as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States, Canada or any other jurisdiction in which we have business operations or to which we export. Although we believe that none of our activities implicate any applicable money laundering statutes, in the event that any of our business activities, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenue accruing thereby are found to be in violation of money laundering statutes, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes described above or any other applicable legislation, and any persons, including such United States-based investors, found to be aiding and abetting us in such violations could be subject to liability. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures.\nWe are required to comply concurrently with all applicable laws in each jurisdiction where we operate or to which we export our products, and any changes to such laws could adversely impact our business.\nVarious federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations govern our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate or propose to operate, and in which we export or propose to export our products. Such laws and regulations include those relating to health and safety, conduct of operations and the production, management, transportation, storage and disposal of our products and of certain material used in our operations. In many cases, we must concurrently comply with complex federal, provincial, state and/or local laws in multiple jurisdictions. These laws change frequently and may be difficult to interpret and apply. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires the investment of significant financial and managerial resources, and a determination that we are not in compliance with any of these laws and regulations could harm our brand image and business. Moreover, it is impossible for us to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations or guidelines upon our future operations. Changes to these laws or regulations could negatively affect our competitive position within our industry and the markets in which we operate, and there is no assurance that various levels of government in the jurisdictions in which we operate will not pass legislation or regulation that adversely impacts our business.\nUnited States regulations relating to hemp-derived CBD products are unclear and rapidly evolving, and changes may not develop in the timeframe or manner most favorable to our business objectives.\nOur participation in the market for hemp-derived CBD products in the United States and elsewhere may require us to employ novel approaches to existing regulatory pathways. Although the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018 legalized the cultivation of hemp in the United States to produce products containing CBD and other non-THC cannabinoids, it remains unclear how the FDA will regulate this industry, and whether and when the FDA will propose or implement new or additional regulations. On May 31, 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD. The FDA has also formed an internal working group to evaluate the potential pathways to market for CBD products. It remains unclear how CBD products will be regulated by the agency going forward.\nIn addition, such products may be subject to regulation at the state or local levels. While the Farm Bill created a pathway under which hemp and its derivatives are exempted from the definition of marijuana and protected from interference in interstate commerce, state and local authorities have issued their own restrictions on the cultivation or sale of hemp or hemp-derived CBD. This includes laws that ban the cultivation or possession of hemp or any other plant of the cannabis genus and derivatives thereof, such as CBD. State regulators may take enforcement action against food and dietary supplement products that contain CBD, or enact new laws or regulations that prohibit or limit the sale of such products. Unforeseen regulatory obstacles or compliance costs may hinder our ability to successfully compete in the market for such products.\nOur strategic alliances and other third-party business relationships may not achieve the intended beneficial impact and expose us to risks.\nWe currently have, and may adjust the scope of, and may in the future enter into, strategic alliances with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. Our ability to complete further strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited by, among other things, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, may not enhance our business or profitability and may involve risks that could adversely affect us, including the investment of significant amounts of management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic alliances. We may become dependent on our strategic partners and actions by such partners could harm our business. Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of debt, impairment charges, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no assurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that our existing strategic alliances will continue to achieve, the expected benefits to our business or that we will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and execute future acquisitions, dispositions or other equity transactions or to successfully manage the impacts of such transactions on our operations.\nMaterial acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions involve a number of risks, including: (i) the potential disruption of our ongoing business; (ii) the distraction of management away from the ongoing oversight of our existing business activities; (iii) incurring additional indebtedness; (iv) the anticipated benefits and cost savings of those transactions not being realized fully, or at all, or taking longer to realize than anticipated; (v) an increase in the scope and complexity of our operations and (vi) the loss or reduction of control over certain of our assets. Material acquisitions and strategic transactions have been and continue to be material to our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable oportunities for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions, be successful in negotiating required agreements, or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements. There is no guarantee that any acquisitions will be accretive, or that past or future acquisitions will not result in additional impairments or write downs.\nThe existence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition could result in our incurring those liabilities. A strategic transaction may result in a significant change in the nature of our business, operations and strategy, and we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing a strategic transaction or integrating any acquired business into our operations.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business, including the risk of crop failure.\nWe grow cannabis, which is an agricultural process. As such, our business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, including risks of crop failure presented by weather, insects, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. Although we currently grow our products indoors under climate-controlled conditions, we are developing outdoor operations and there can be no assurance that natural elements, such as insects and plant diseases, will not entirely interrupt our production activities or have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or significant customers reduce their purchases, our revenue could decline significantly.\nThree customers accounted for 19%, 15% and 11%, respectively, of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Four customers accounted for 87% of our adult-use revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Two customers accounted for 13% each of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. One customer accounted for 24% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe believe that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a small number of customers. These customers have no purchase commitments and may cancel, change or delay purchases with little or no notice or penalty. As a result of this customer concentration, our revenue could fluctuate materially and could be materially and disproportionately impacted by purchasing decisions of these customers or any other significant customer. In the future, these customers may decide to purchase less product from us than they have in the past, may alter purchasing patterns at any time with limited notice, or may decide not to continue to purchase our products at all, any of which could cause our revenue to decline materially and materially harm our financial\ncondition and results of operations. If we are unable to diversify our customer base, we will continue to be susceptible to risks associated with customer concentration.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain key personnel, and we may be unable to attract, develop and retain additional employees required for our development and future success.\nOur success is largely dependent on the performance of our management team and certain employees and our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. The loss of the services of any key personnel, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could prevent us from executing on our business plan and strategy, and we may be unable to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. We do not currently maintain key-person insurance on the lives of any of our key personnel.\nFurther, officers, directors, and certain key personnel at each of our facilities that are licensed by Health Canada are subject to the requirement to obtain and maintain a security clearance from Health Canada under the CR. Moreover, under the CR, an individual with security clearance must be physically present on site when other individuals are conducting activities with cannabis. Under the CR, a security clearance is valid for a limited time and must be renewed before the expiry of a current security clearance. There is no assurance that any of our existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearances or that new personnel who require a security clearance will be able to obtain one. A failure by an individual in a key operational position to maintain or renew his or her security clearance could result in a reduction or complete suspension of our operations. In addition, if an individual in a key operational position leaves us, and we are unable to find a suitable replacement who is able to obtain a security clearance required by the CR in a timely manner, or at all, we may not be able to conduct our operations at planned production volume levels or at all. The CR also requires us to designate a qualified individual in charge who is responsible for supervising activities relating to the production of study drugs for clinical trials, which individual must meet certain educational and security clearance requirements. If our current designated qualified person in charge fails to maintain their security clearance, or if our current designated qualified person in charge leaves us and we are unable to find a suitable replacement who meets these requirements, we may no longer be able to continue our clinical trial activities.\nIncreased labor costs, potential organization of our workforce, employee strikes, and other labor-related disruption may adversely affect our operations.\nOutside Portugal, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In Portugal, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to any workforce-initiated labor agreement. As with all companies carrying on business in Portugal, we are subject to a government-mandated collective bargaining agreement, which grants employees nominal additional benefits beyond those required by the local labor code. We cannot assure that our labor costs going forward will remain competitive based on various factors, such as: (i) our workforce may organize in the future and labor agreements may be put in place that have significantly higher labor rates and company obligations; (ii) our competitors may maintain significantly lower labor costs, thereby reducing or eliminating our comparative advantages vis-\u00e0-vis one or more of our competitors or the larger industry; and (iii) our labor costs may increase in connection with our growth.\nSignificant interruptions in our access to certain supply chains, for key inputs such as raw materials, electricity, water and other utilities may impair our cannabis growing operations.\nOur business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs (certain of which are sourced in other countries and on different continents), including raw materials, supplies and equipment related to our operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities. We operate global manufacturing facilities, and have dispersed suppliers and customers. Governments may regulate or restrict the flow of our labor or our products, and the Company's operations, suppliers, customers and distribution channels could be severely impacted. While we have not experienced any material supply chain disruptions, any significant future governmental-mandated or market-related interruption, price increase or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs and, in particular, rising or volatile energy costs could curtail or preclude our ability to continue production. In addition, our operations would be significantly affected by a prolonged power outage.\nOur ability to compete and grow cannabis is dependent on us having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to skilled labor, equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that we will be\nsuccessful in maintaining our required supply of labor, equipment, parts and components. See also \u201cRisks related to COVID-19\u201d.\nWe may require third party supply of quality cannabis flower, which may adversely affect our costs and subject us to unreliable supply chains or product quality.\nOur business is highly dependent on the production and sale of acceptable and certifiable cannabis flower. Our operations may not produce sufficient volumes of cannabis flower or particular cultivars (commonly referred to as \u201cstrains\u201d) to meet consumer demand. It is also possible that our cannabis flower production fails to meet our strict internal quality standards or external regulation specifications. This may require us to contract with third parties to purchase cannabis flower. There is no guarantee we will be able to source cannabis flower at attractive prices or that any third party-sourced product will meet our quality standards and all regulatory requirements. If we are unable to source sufficient cannabis flower for any of these reasons, our sales goals may not be achieved or our costs may increase, or both may occur. An increasing reliance on third party cannabis flower supply could materially impact our business reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in cannabinoid prices relative to contracted prices with third party suppliers could negatively impact our earnings.\nA portion of our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon cannabinoid supply contracts. As part of our normal course operations, we periodically enter into large and medium-to-long-term supply contracts with third-party growers. Production and pricing of cannabinoids are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. The market for cannabis biomass is particularly volatile compared to other commoditized markets due to the relatively nascent maturity of the industry in which we operate. The lack of centralized data and large variations in product quality make it difficult to establish a \u201cspot price\u201d for cannabinoids and develop an effective price hedging strategy. Accordingly, supply contracts with any term may prove to be costly in the future to the extent cannabinoid prices decrease dramatically or at a faster rate than anticipated. Furthermore, supply contracts typically include minimum purchase requirements which could force us to buy significant quantities of product at non-competitive prices in a rapidly changing market.\nOur failure to successfully negotiate supply contracts that address such market vagaries could result in us being contractually obligated to purchase significant amounts of products, some of which may be priced above then-current market prices, or interruption of the supply of inputs for the manufacturing of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nWe face risks associated with the transportation of our cannabis products to consumers in a safe and efficient manner.\nDue to our direct-to-consumer shipping model for medical cannabis in Canada, we depend on fast and efficient third-party transportation services to distribute our medical cannabis products. We also use such services to transfer bulk shipments to provinces and territories for further distribution to private and public retailers focused on non-medical consumers. Any prolonged disruption of third-party transportation services, such as any Canada Post disruptions, could have a material adverse effect on our sales volumes or satisfaction with our services. Rising costs associated with third-party transportation services used by us to ship our products may also adversely impact our profitability, and more generally our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe security of our products during transportation to and from our facilities is of the utmost concern. A breach of security during transport or delivery could result in the loss of high-value product and forfeiture of import and export approvals, since such approvals are shipment specific. Any failure to take steps necessary to ensure the safekeeping of cannabis products could also have an impact on our ability to continue supplying provinces and territories, to continue operating under our existing licenses, to renew or receive amendments to our existing licenses or to obtain new licenses.\nOur cannabis products may be subject to recalls for a variety of reasons, which could require us to expend significant management and capital resources.\nManufacturers and distributors of cannabis products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, adulteration, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety, and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing finished cannabis products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits, whether frivolous or otherwise. If any of the cannabis products produced by us are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. As a result of any such recall, we may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable gross profit or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention or damage our reputation and goodwill or that of our products or brands.\nAdditionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by Health Canada or other regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention, increased compliance costs and potential legal fees, fines, penalties and other expenses. Any product recall affecting the cannabis industry more broadly, whether or not involving us, could also lead consumers to lose confidence in the safety and security of the products sold by Licensed Producers generally, including products sold by us.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims or regulatory action. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of serious adverse side effects.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products which are ingested by humans, we face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused loss or injury. We may be subject to these types of claims due to allegations that our products caused or contributed to injury or illness, failed to include adequate instructions for use or failed to include adequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses, symptoms for individuals with bipolar disorder, and other side effects. Furthermore, we are now offering an expanded assortment of form factors, some of which may have additional adverse side effects, such as vaping products. See also, \u201cOur vape business is subject to uncertainty in the evolving vape market due to negative public sentiment and regulatory scrutiny.\u201d\nPreviously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could also occur.\nIn addition, the manufacture and sale of cannabis products, like the manufacture and sale of any ingested product, involves a risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. We have in the past recalled, and may again in the future have to recall, certain of our cannabis products as a result of potential contamination and quality assurance concerns. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation and goodwill with our patients and consumers generally. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could result in us becoming subject to significant liabilities that are uninsured and also could adversely affect our commercial arrangements with third parties.\nWe rely on third-party distributors to distribute our products, and those distributors may not perform their obligations.\nWe rely on third-party distributors, including pharmaceutical distributors, courier services, and government agencies, and may in the future rely on other third parties, to distribute our products. If these distributors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, if there is a delay or interruption in the distribution of our products, or if these third parties damage our products, it could negatively impact our revenue from product sales. Any damage to our products, such as product spoilage, could expose us to potential product liability, damage our reputation and the reputation of our brands or otherwise harm our business.\nWe, or the cannabis industry more generally, may receive unfavorable publicity or become subject to negative consumer or investor perception.\nWe believe that the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon positive consumer and investor perception regarding the benefits, safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to consumers. The perception of the cannabis industry and cannabis products, currently and in the future, may be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, political statements, media attention and other publicity (whether or not accurate or with merit) both in Canada and in other countries relating to the consumption of cannabis products, including unexpected safety or efficacy concerns arising with respect to cannabis products or the activities of industry participants. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabis market or any particular cannabis product or will be consistent with earlier publicity. Adverse scientific research reports, findings and regulatory proceedings that are, or litigation, media attention or other publicity that is, perceived as less favorable than, or that questions, earlier research reports, findings or publicity (whether or not accurate or with merit) could result in a significant reduction in the demand for our cannabis products. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis, or our products specifically, or associating the consumption of cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could adversely affect us. This adverse publicity could arise even if the adverse effects associated with cannabis products resulted from consumers\u2019 failure to use such products legally, appropriately or as directed.\nCertain events or developments in the cannabis industry more generally may impact our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation can result from the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including any negative publicity, whether true or not. As a producer and distributor of cannabis, which is a controlled substance in Canada that has previously been commonly associated with various other narcotics, violence and criminal activities, there is a risk that our business might attract negative publicity. There is also a risk that the actions of other Licensed Producers or of other companies and service providers in the cannabis industry may negatively affect the reputation of the industry as a whole and thereby negatively impact our reputation. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share negative opinions and views in regards to our activities and the cannabis industry in general, whether true or not.\nWe do not ultimately have direct control over how we or the cannabis industry is perceived by others. Reputational issues may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and present an impediment to our overall ability to advance our business strategy and realize on our growth prospects.\nFailure to comply with safety, health and environmental regulations applicable to our operations and industry may expose us to liability and impact operations.\nSafety, health and environmental laws and regulations affect nearly all aspects of our operations, including product development, working conditions, waste disposal, emission controls, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation, and, with respect to environmental laws and regulations, impose limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with GMP requires satisfying additional standards for the conduct of our operations and subjects us to ongoing compliance inspections in respect of these standards in connection with our GMP certified facilities. Compliance with safety, health and environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and failure to comply with such safety, health and environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the temporary or permanent suspension of operations, the imposition of clean-up costs resulting from contaminated properties, the imposition of damages and the loss of or refusal of governmental authorities to issue permits or licenses to us or to certify our compliance with GMP standards. Exposure to these liabilities may arise in connection with our existing operations, our historical operations and operations that we may undertake in the future. We could also be held liable for worker exposure to hazardous substances and for accidents causing injury or death. There can be no assurance that we will at all times be in compliance with all safety, health and environmental laws and regulations notwithstanding our attempts to comply with such laws and regulations.\nChanges in applicable safety, health and environmental standards may impose stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and\nemployees. We are not able to determine the specific impact that future changes in safety, health and environmental laws and regulations may have on our industry, operations and/or activities and our resulting financial position; however, we anticipate that capital expenditures and operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new and increasingly stringent safety, health and environmental laws and regulations. Further changes in safety, health and environmental laws and regulations, new information on existing safety, health and environmental conditions or other events, including legal proceedings based upon such conditions or an inability to obtain necessary permits in relation thereto, may require increased compliance expenditures by us.\nWe may become subject to liability and harm arising from fraudulent or illegal activity by our employees, contractors, consultants and others.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, service providers and licensors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional undertakings of unauthorized activities, or reckless or negligent undertakings of authorized activities, in each case on our behalf or in our service that violate: (i) government regulations, specifically Health Canada regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) Canadian federal and provincial healthcare laws and regulations; (iv) Canadian federal and provincial privacy laws and regulations; (v) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data; (vi) United States federal laws banning the possession, sale or importation of cannabis into the United States and prohibiting the financing of activities outside the United States that are unlawful under Canadian or other foreign laws or (vii) the terms of our agreements with insurers. For example, we could be exposed to class action and other litigation, increased Health Canada inspections and related sanctions, the loss of current GMP compliance certifications or the inability to obtain future GMP compliance certifications, lost sales and revenue or reputational damage as a result of prohibited activities that are undertaken in the growing or production process of our products without our knowledge or permission and contrary to our internal policies, procedures and operating requirements.\nWe cannot always identify and prevent misconduct by our employees and other third parties, including service providers and licensors, and the precautions taken by us to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown, unanticipated or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from such misconduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal or administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines and contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings or curtailment of our operations.\nWe may experience breaches of security at our facilities, which could result in product loss and liability.\nBecause of the nature of our products and the limited legal channels for distribution, as well as the concentration of inventory in our facilities, we are subject to the risk of theft of our products and other security breaches. A security breach at any one of our facilities could result in a significant loss of available products, expose us to additional liability under applicable regulations and to potentially costly litigation or increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of similar thefts, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risks related to our information technology systems, including service interruption, cyber-attacks and misappropriation of data, which could disrupt operations and may result in financial losses and reputational damage.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology, or IT, services in connection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our vendors protect networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism, theft, malware, ransomware and phishing attacks. We are increasingly reliant on Cloud-based systems for economies of scale and our mobile workforce, which could result in increased attack vectors or other significant disruptions to our work processes. Any of these and other events could result in IT system failures, delays or increases in capital expenses. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment and IT systems and software,\nas well as preemptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. The failure of IT systems or a component of IT systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nThere are a number of laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information and other personal information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the privacy rules under the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (Canada), or PIPEDA, the European Unions\u2019 General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, protect medical records and other personal information of individuals. We collect and store personal information about our employees and customers and are responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches. A privacy breach may occur through a procedural or process failure, an IT malfunction or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Theft of data for competitive purposes, particularly patient lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated through employee collusion or negligence or through deliberate cyber-attack. Moreover, if we are found to be in violation of the privacy or security rules under PIPEDA or other laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, including as a result of data theft and privacy breaches, we could be subject to sanction, litigation and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. While we have implemented security resources to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Significant disruption to our information technology system or breaches of data security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to expand our operations quickly enough to meet demand or successfully manage our operations beyond their current scale.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations, including any acquisitions, effectively, that we will be able to sustain or accelerate our growth or that such growth, if achieved, will result in profitable operations, that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient management personnel necessary for continued growth or that we will be able to successfully make strategic investments or acquisitions. This challenge has been compounded with the launch of multiple new form factors as a result of Cannabis 2.0. See also \u201cWe may not be able to successfully develop new products or commercialize such products.\u201d\nDemand for cannabis-based products is dependent on a number of social, political and economic factors that are beyond our control. There is no assurance that an increase in existing demand will occur, that we will benefit from any such demand increase or that our business will remain profitable even in the event of such an increase in demand. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, the value of our Class 2 common stock and the notes may significantly decrease.\nThe cannabis industry continues to face significant funding challenges, and we may not be able to secure adequate or reliable sources of funding, which may impact our operations and potential expansion.\nThe continued development of our business will require significant additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to achieve our business objectives. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on investor demand, our performance and reputation, market conditions, and other factors. Our inability to raise such capital could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of our current business objectives or our inability to continue to operate our business. On February 28, 2020, we entered into a senior secured credit facility with Bridging Finance Inc., for an aggregate principal amount of $59.6 million, as further amended on June 5, 2020, the \u201cSenior Credit Facility.\u201d On March 17, 2020, we issued Class 2 common stock, pre-funded warrants and warrants, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $85.3 million. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of equity or debt financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable to us. See also \u201cOur senior secured credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\u201d\nIn addition, from time to time, we may enter into transactions to acquire assets or the capital stock or other equity interests of other entities. Our continued growth may be financed, wholly or partially, with debt, which may\nincrease our debt levels above industry standards. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Debt financings may also contain provisions that, if breached, may entitle lenders or their agents to accelerate the repayment of loans or realize a first priority security over our significant operating assets, and there is no assurance that we would be able to repay such loans in such an event or prevent the enforcement of security granted pursuant to any such debt financing.\nOur senior secured credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOn February 28, 2020, we entered into the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility contains, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, invest in our existing facilities, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create additional liens, repurchase stock or make other restricted payments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $306.3 million in aggregate principal indebtedness (refer to Notes 14 & 15) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current and future indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business has not generated positive cash flow from operations. If this continues in the future, we may not have sufficient cash flows to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our current and future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nManagement may not be able to successfully implement adequate internal controls over financial reporting.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Our management and other personnel have limited experience operating a public company, which may result in a failure of our ICFR and Disclosure Controls and Procedures (\u201cDCP\u201d) necessary to ensure timely and accurate reporting of operational and financial results. Due to inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in one component of internal control as defined by COSO 2013 (Control Activities). In particular, we did not fully design and implement effective control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. We have identified deficiencies that constitute a\nmaterial weakness, either individually or in the aggregate. This material weakness is attributable to the following factors:\n\u2022\nWe did not have effective controls over the review procedures for balance sheet account reconciliations and manual journal entries.\n\u2022\nWe did not have effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of key spreadsheets and reports used in the measurement and valuation of inventory.\n\u2022\nWe did not have documented evidence of review procedures and did not have sufficient segregation of duties within our accounting function for Manitoba Harvest and the Portugal business unit.\nDue to the existence of the above material weakness, management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. This material weakness creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and our directors and officers as a result of other business activities undertaken by such individuals.\nWe may be subject to various potential conflicts of interest because some of our directors and executive officers may be engaged in a range of business activities. In addition, our directors and executive officers are permitted under their applicable agreements with us to devote time to their outside business interests, so long as such activities do not materially or adversely interfere with their duties to us and subject to any contractual provisions restricting such activities. These business interests could require the investment of significant time and attention by our executive officers and directors. In some cases, our executive officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Brendan Kennedy and board member, Michael Auerbach, may have fiduciary obligations associated with business interests that interfere with their ability to devote time to our business and affairs, which could adversely affect our operations. Please refer to the section titled \u201cTransactions with Related Persons\u201d in our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on April 30, 2020, for further information.\nThird parties with whom we do business may perceive themselves as being exposed to reputational risk as a result of their relationship with us.\nThe parties with whom we do business, or would like to do business, may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of our business activities relating to cannabis, which could hinder our ability to establish or maintain business relationships. These perceptions relating to the cannabis industry may interfere with our relationship with service providers, particularly in the financial services industry.\nBecause a significant portion of our sales are generated in Canada and other countries outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the United States dollar. We derive a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs in Canada, as well as other countries outside the United States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, changes in the exchange rate in these jurisdictions relative to the United States dollar, may have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the United States dollar against the Canadian dollar and the Euro, although as we expand internationally, we will be subject to additional foreign currency exchange risks. Because we recognize revenue in Canada in Canadian dollars and revenue in Europe in Euros, if either or both of these currencies weaken against the United States dollar it would have a negative impact on our Canadian and/or European operating results upon the translation of those results into United States dollars for the purposes of consolidation. In addition, a weakening of these foreign currencies against the United States dollar would make it more difficult for us to meet our obligations under the convertible notes. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur income tax obligations are based on our corporate operating structure and third-party and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our international business activities, including the laws of the United States, Canada and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and uncertain interpretation. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, intercompany arrangements, or transfer pricing, all of which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and the amount of taxes that we pay and seriously harm our business. Taxing authorities may also determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with how we report our income, which could increase our effective tax rate and the amount of taxes that we pay and could seriously harm our business. In addition, our future income taxes could fluctuate because of earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by United States federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome from a review or audit could seriously harm our business. In addition, determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome relating to such amounts may differ for such period or periods and may seriously harm our business. Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions, we may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may be subject to risks related to the protection of our intellectual property rights and allegations that we are in violation of intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe ownership, licensing and protection of trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights are significant to the success of our business. Unauthorized parties may attempt to replicate or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology. Policing and enforcing the unauthorized use of our current or future trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights now or in the future could be difficult, expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. Identifying the unauthorized use of intellectual property rights is difficult as we may be unable to effectively monitor and evaluate the products being distributed by our competitors, including unlicensed dispensaries and black-market participants, and the processes used to produce such products. Moreover, we may not be successful in any infringement proceeding.\nIn addition, other parties may claim that our products, or those that we license from others, infringe on their proprietary or patent protected rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and legal fees, result in injunctions or temporary restraining orders or require the payment of damages. As well, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed on their lawful rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property that we do not own.\nWe also rely on certain trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information that are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position. Our trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, which are not protected by patents, may become known to or be independently developed by competitors, which could adversely affect us.\nWe license certain intellectual property rights from third-party licensors, and the failure of the licensor to properly maintain or enforce their intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are party to a number of licenses, including with entities formerly affiliated with the former Privateer Holdings, Inc. (\u201cPrivateer Holdings\u201d) that give us rights to use third-party intellectual property that is useful to our business. Our success will depend, in part, on the ability of the licensor to maintain and enforce its licensed intellectual property, in particular, those intellectual property rights to which we have secured exclusive rights. Without protection for the intellectual property we have licensed, other companies might be able to offer substantially similar products for sale or utilize substantially similar processes, which could have an adverse effect on us.\nAny of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement, whether with or without merit, and accordingly seek to terminate our license. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize certain products or services and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not realize the full benefit of the clinical trials or studies that we participate in if we are unable to secure ownership or the exclusive right to use the resulting intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms.\nAlthough we have participated in several clinical trials, we are not the sponsor of many of these trials and, as such, do not have full control over the design, conduct and terms of the trials. In some cases, for instance, we are only the provider of a cannabis study drug for a trial that is designed and initiated by an independent investigator within an academic institution. In such cases, we are often not able to acquire rights to all the intellectual property generated by the trials. Although the terms of all clinical trial agreements entered into by us provide us with, at a minimum, ownership of intellectual property relating directly to the study drug being trialed (e.g. intellectual property relating to use of the study drug), ownership of intellectual property that does not relate directly to the study drug is often retained by the institution. As such, we are vulnerable to any dispute among the investigator, the institution and us with respect to classification and therefore ownership of any particular piece of intellectual property generated during the trial. Such a dispute may affect our ability to make full use of intellectual property generated by a clinical trial.\nWhere intellectual property generated by a trial is owned by the institution, we are often granted a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to such intellectual property. If we exercise such a right, there is a risk that the parties will fail to come to an agreement on the license, in which case such intellectual property may be licensed to other parties or commercialized by the institution.\nWe may not realize the full benefit of third-party licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or restrictions on packaging and marketing hinder our ability to realize the value, which may adversely impact profitability.\nAn integral part of our Canadian adult-use cannabis business strategy involves obtaining territorially exclusive licenses to produce products using various brands and images. As a licensee of brand-based properties, we have no assurance that a particular brand or property will translate into a successful adult-use cannabis product. Additionally, a successful brand may not continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales. As well, the popularity of licensed properties may not result in popular products or the success of the properties with the public. Promotion, packaging and labelling of adult-use cannabis is strictly regulated. These restrictions may further hinder our ability to benefit from our licenses. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing current licenses or opportunities for potential new licenses. If we are unable to acquire or maintain successful licenses on advantageous terms, or to derive sufficient revenue from sales of licensed products, the profitability and success of our adult-use cannabis business may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our Class 2 common stock in public markets has experienced and may experience severe fluctuations.\nThe market price for our Class 2 common stock, and the market price of stock of other companies operating in the cannabis industry, has been extremely volatile. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the trading price of our Class 2 common stock ranged between a low sales price of $2.43 and a high sales price of $22.95 and included single day fluctuations as high as 64.13%. Additionally, during 2019, the trading price of our Class 2 common stock fluctuated between a low sales price of $15.57 and a high sales price of $106.00 per share. The market price of our Class 2 common stock may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations; (ii) recommendations by securities research analysts; (iii) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other issuers that investors deem comparable to us; (iv) the addition or departure of our executive officers or other key personnel; (v) the release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our common stock, such as release of 11.0 million Class 2 shares on April 3, 2020, 19.5 million shares, in aggregate, of Class 1 and Class 2 common stock on June 5, 2020, and 7.0 million shares, of Class 2 common stock on December 14, 2020, each associated with the Downstream Merger; (vi) sales or perceived sales, or the expectation of future sales, of our common stock; (vii) significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; and (viii) news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in the cannabis industry or our target markets.\nFuture sales or distributions of our securities could cause the market price for our Class 2 common stock to fall significantly.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares of our Class 2 common stock intend to sell our Class 2 common stock, could significantly reduce the market price of our Class 2 common stock.\nPursuant to the Downstream Merger, former Privateer Holdings stockholders who received shares of our common stock in the Downstream Merger entered into a lock-up agreement. Each Privateer Holdings equity holder who received shares of our stock in the Downstream Merger is subject to a lock-up allowing for the sale of such shares only under certain circumstances over a two-year period.\nOn April 3, 2020, we released 11.0 million shares of our Class 2 common stock, on June 5, 2020, we released 19.5 million shares, in aggregate, of our Class 1 and Class 2 common stock, and on December 14, 2020 we released 7.0 million shares of our Class 2 common stock from the restrictions under the Downstream Merger lock-up agreement. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that sales of those released shares or any future public sales of our securities or the availability of these securities for sale will have on the market price of our Class 2 common stock. In aggregate, 37.5 million shares of Class 1 and Class 2 common stock have been released from the lock-up restrictions of the Downstream Merger, representing approximately 50% of the originally locked-up shares (including for purposes of such percentage calculation shares that remain subject to escrow and/or subject to outstanding assumed stock options). The remaining 50% of the shares subject to the lock-up restrictions are required to be released on an equal quarterly basis over the following 12 months, unless we choose to release them on a more accelerated schedule. The release of the remaining portion of shares subject to the lock-up on the described schedule, or on a more accelerated basis, could put significant downward pricing pressure on our stock. If the market price of our Class 2 common stock were to drop as a result, this might impede our ability to raise additional capital and might cause our remaining stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nThe terms of our outstanding warrants may limit our ability to raise additional equity capital or pursue acquisitions, which may impact funding of our ongoing operations and cause significant dilution to existing stockholders.\nOn March 13, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC relating to the issuance and sale of 7,250,000 shares of our Class 2 common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 11,750,000 shares of our Class 2 common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase 19,000,000 shares of our Class 2 common stock at a price to the public of $4.76 per share for Class 2 common stock and accompanying warrant and $4.7599 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant. The accompanying warrants, or the warrants, became exercisable six months after the date of issuance. The issuance of shares of our Class 2 common stock and exercise of the pre-funded warrants thereafter resulted in an issuance of 19,000,000 additional shares of Class 2 common stock.\nThe warrants contain a price protection, or anti-dilution feature, pursuant to which, the exercise price of such warrants will be reduced to the consideration paid for, or the exercise price or conversion price of, as the case may be, any newly issued securities issued at a discount to the original warrant exercise price of $5.95 per share. The anti-dilution feature was approved by our stockholders, and, therefore, the exercise price of the warrants may end up being lower than $5.95 per share, which could result in significant incremental dilution to existing stockholders.\nAdditionally, so long as the warrants remain outstanding, we may only issue up to $20 million in aggregate gross proceeds under our at-the-market offering program at prices less than the exercise price of the warrants, and in no event more than $6 million per quarter at prices below the exercise price of the warrants, without triggering the warrant\u2019s anti-dilution feature described in the paragraph immediately above. If our stock price were to remain below the warrant exercise price of $5.95 per share for an extended time, we may be forced to lower the warrant exercise price at unfavorable terms in order to fund our ongoing operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class 2 common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes in cash or to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of the convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class 2 common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible notes surrendered. In addition, our ability to repurchase the convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the convertible notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness\nwere to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the convertible notes is triggered, holders of convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class 2 common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of convertible notes do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur stockholders may be subject to dilution resulting from future offerings of common stock by us.\nWe may raise additional funds in the future by issuing common stock or equity-linked securities. Holders of our securities have no preemptive rights in connection with such further issuances. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine if an issuance of our capital stock is warranted, the price at which such issuance is to be effected and the other terms of any future issuance of capital stock. In addition, additional common stock will be issued by us in connection with the exercise of options or grant of other equity awards granted by us. Such additional equity issuances could, depending on the price at which such securities are issued, substantially dilute the interests of the holders of our existing securities.\nConversion of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class 2 common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the convertible notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class 2 common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class 2 common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our Class 2 common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class 2 common stock, any sales in the public market of our Class 2 common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class 2 common stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our Class 2 common stock could depress the price of our Class 2 common stock.\nIt is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our Class 2 common stock for the foreseeable future, if ever.\nNo dividends on our Class 2 common stock have been paid to date. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, we will retain future earnings and other cash resources for the operation and development of our business. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our earnings, operating results, financial condition and current and anticipated cash needs. Further, our future ability to pay cash dividends on our Class 2 common stock is limited by the terms of the Senior Credit Facility and cannot be paid without the consent of Bridging Finance Inc., as well as any future debt or preferred securities.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class 2 common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our Class 2 common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nExcept in limited circumstances, our stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders\u2019 meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings or special stockholders\u2019 meetings called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nStockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nCertain jurisdictions may take positions adverse to investments in cannabis companies or to the investors themselves.\nCertain jurisdictions may prohibit or restrict its citizens or residents from investing in or transacting with companies involved in the cannabis industry, even if such companies only conduct business in jurisdictions where cannabis is legal. For example, if an investor in the United Kingdom profits from an investment in a cannabis producer or supplier, such investment may technically violate the United Kingdom Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Similar prohibitions or restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions where cannabis has not been legalized. In addition, such prohibitions and restriction may limit the ability to receive dividends if such dividends were to be declared in the future. However, no dividends on our Class 2 common stock have been paid to date and we do not anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, we will pay cash dividends on our Class 2 common stock.\nAs a result of an investment in our securities, you could be prevented from entering the United States or become subject to a lifetime ban on entry into the United States.\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) has confirmed that border agents may seek to permanently ban any foreign visitor who admits to working or investing in the cannabis industry, or admits to having used cannabis, even though adult-use cannabis is now legal in Canada. CBP confirmed that investing even in publicly-traded cannabis companies is considered facilitation of illicit drug trade under CBP policy. This policy is limited to citizens of foreign countries and not citizens of the United States. Therefore, as a result of an investment in our securities, if you are not a citizen of the United States, you could be prevented from entering the United States or could become subject to a lifetime ban on entry into the United States.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the convertible notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the convertible notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the convertible notes requires us to repurchase the convertible notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the relevant conversion rate for a holder that converts its convertible notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the convertible notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nAny derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nAny action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022\nAny action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nAny action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this choice of forum provision. It is possible that a court of law could rule that the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable if it is challenged in a proceeding or otherwise.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage, the premiums may not continue to be commercially justifiable, and coverage limitations or exclusions may leave us exposed to uninsured liabilities.\nWe currently have insurance coverage, including product liability insurance, protecting many, but not all, of our assets and operations. Our insurance coverage is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for all of the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities, including potential product liability claims, or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, we may be exposed to material uninsured liabilities that could impede our liquidity, profitability or solvency.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to our IPO. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including requirements to file annual, quarterly and event-driven reports with respect to our business and financial condition and operations and establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Effective January 1, 2020, we became a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under SEC reporting rules and are required to file our annual report and quarterly reports more quickly than we previously had been required to file them, which may require us to dedicate additional resources to the timely filing of such reports. In addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d), which must be accompanied by an attestation report on ICFR issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we have documented and evaluated our ICFR, which has been both costly and challenging. Our existing management team has and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives, and we may need to hire additional personnel to assist us with\ncomplying with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nTax and accounting requirements may change in ways that are unforeseen to us and we may face difficulty or be unable to implement or comply with any such changes.\nWe are subject to numerous tax and accounting requirements, and changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, or varying interpretations of current rules or practices, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results, the manner in which we conduct our business or the marketability of any of our products. We currently have international operations and plan to expand such operations in the future. These operations, and any expansion thereto, will require us to comply with the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, which may vary substantially. Complying with the tax laws of these jurisdictions can be time consuming and expensive and could potentially subject us to penalties and fees in the future if we fail to comply.\nThe long-term effect of United States tax reform or the recently enacted CARES Act could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cU.S. Tax Act\u201d) was enacted, which contains significant changes to United States tax law. The U.S. Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made. Additionally, further guidance may be forthcoming from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC, as well as regulations, interpretations and rulings from state tax agencies, which could result in additional impacts, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes or potential additional impacts could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We will continue to examine and assess the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits NOL carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. Further it provides for increased deductibility of interest expense in 2019 and 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act, but we do not currently expect that the NOL carryback provision or increased interest deductibility of the CARES Act to result in a material cash benefit to us.", "PERMNO": 17977, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TLRY"}
