{"cik": "49754", "company": "Dine Brands Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe occurrence of any of the events discussed in the following risk factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. It is not possible to identify or predict all risk factors. There may be risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that are currently deemed by us to be immaterial. These other risks and uncertainties may also impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may further disrupt our business, which could further materially affect our operations, and business and financial results. In addition, any other epidemic, disease outbreak or public health emergency may result in similar adverse effects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact sales and traffic at our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants, may make it more difficult to staff restaurants and, in more severe cases, may damage our reputation, cause an inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs or continue to cause partial or total closures of impacted restaurants. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics, disease outbreaks or public health emergencies will impact our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, epidemic, disease outbreak, or public health emergency; the negative impact on the economy; the short and longer-term impacts on the demand for restaurant services and levels of consumer confidence; the ability of us and our franchisees to successfully navigate the impacts; government action, including restrictions on restaurant operations; increased unemployment; and reductions in consumer discretionary spending. Even if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened many of the other risks described in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nWe and our franchisees have been and could further be adversely affected by government restrictions on public gatherings; shelter-in-place orders; and limitations on operations of restaurants, including dine-in restrictions, mandatory or voluntary closures or restrictions on hours of operations. Certain restaurants in the U.S. and abroad are currently under government mandates or guidelines to temporarily suspend operation of restaurants or limit restaurant dine-in business in light of COVID-19. We are unable to predict when these measures may be scaled back, or how quickly our operations will return to previous levels after the measures are scaled back. Certain other restaurants have had dine-in restrictions and other operational limitations lifted but we are unable to predict whether or when these restrictions may be reinstated or new restrictions may be implemented if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens. To assist franchisees impacted by COVID-19, we have offered deferral of royalty, advertising, and other fees, including, in some cases, lease payments. We have allowed franchisee to defer development obligations for up to 15 months. These changes and any additional changes may materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly if these changes are in place for a prolonged amount of time. The COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics, disease outbreaks or public health emergencies may also materially adversely affect our ability to implement our growth plans, including delays in development of new locations or adversely impact our overall ability to successfully execute our plans to enter into new markets.\nAs we previously announced, we drew down a significant majority of the amount available under our revolving facility. The increase in our level of debt may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or ability to incur additional debt. Furthermore, the impacts of COVID-19 could cause us to fail to meet certain financial performance measures, including debt service coverage ratios and minimum domestic franchise system sales amounts, that must be met to avoid a possible rapid amortization event or event of default under the terms of our existing debt arrangements. In addition, as a result of the risks described above, we may be required to raise additional capital, and there is no guarantee that debt and/or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions that are largely out of our control. Our business is dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's or IHOP restaurants. If our customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending is reduced (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, changes to tax regulations, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or if the perceived wealth of customers decreases (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, changes to tax regulations or other economic disruptions), our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or other alternatives to dining out. Additionally, negative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials could affect our and our franchisees' ability to maintain and remodel existing restaurants. Any\ndecreases in customer traffic or average customer check due to these or other reasons could reduce gross sales at our and our franchised restaurants, resulting in lower revenues, royalty payments and other payments from franchisees. This could negatively impact the financial performance of our company-operated restaurants and reduce the profitability of franchised restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due and negatively impacting franchisees\u2019 ability to develop new restaurants as may be required in their respective development agreements.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt. As of December 31, 2020, certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries had approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In addition, we had approximately $0.5 billion in operating lease, finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2020. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness and the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial health. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or refinance any of our debt on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, repurchase shares of our common stock, fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy;\n\u2022subject us to risks associated with rising interest rates and uncertainty related to the proposed phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); and\n\u2022result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt documents, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nThe terms of the securitized debt issued by certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and the failure to comply with such restrictive terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects. Unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of the securitized debt issued by certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries. For example, the indenture entered into by such subsidiaries in connection with the securitized debt contains covenants that limit the ability of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to, among other things: sell assets; alter the business conducted by such subsidiaries; engage in mergers or acquisitions; declare dividends or redeem or purchase certain equity interests; incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees; make loans and investments; incur liens; and enter into transactions with affiliates other than on an arms-length basis. These covenants are applicable only to the securitization subsidiaries and do not apply to any of Dine Brands Global, Inc., International House of Pancakes, LLC, Applebee\u2019s International, Inc. or Dine Brands International, Inc. as these entities are not parties to the indenture. A breach of a covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt.\nFurther, the securitized debt also includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and contains a number of financial performance measures that must be met to avoid a possible rapid amortization event or event of default. The most significant of these measures include a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum domestic franchise system sales. The ability to meet these financial performance measures can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy these financial measures.\nIf amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets, which consist of substantially all of our domestic revenue-generating assets and domestic intellectual property.\nDuring the five-year term following issuance, the outstanding fixed-rate class A-2-I senior notes will accrue interest at a rate of 4.194% per year. During the seven-year term following issuance, the outstanding fixed-rate class A-2-II senior notes will accrue interest at a rate of 4.723% per year. Additionally, the fixed-rate class A-2-I and class A-2-II senior notes have scheduled quarterly principal amortization payments of $1.75 million and $1.5 million, respectively. If we maintain a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 5.25x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments. From time\nto time, our leverage ratio has exceeded the 5.25x total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio and we have made the required scheduled principal payments. If we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the applicable five- or seven-year term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable five- or seven-year term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control. No assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate favorable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing. Further, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with refinancing our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe are heavily dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including point-of-sale processing in our and our franchisees' restaurants, online ordering and delivery, management of our supply chain, collection of cash and other receivables, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to effectively and efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrades or the transition to replacement systems, inaccurate or fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations and negatively impact our business. Significant capital investment might be required to remediate any problems.\nIn addition, we outsource certain essential technology-based business processes to third-party vendors and we may share sensitive financial and other information with third party vendors which subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business, increased costs and exposure to data breaches or privacy law compliance issues of our third-party vendors.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm our brands. Any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources is considered to be a cyber incident. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information about our customers, franchisees, vendors and employees. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those that we have outsourced. Primary adverse events that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include (i) exposure of confidential data about our customers, franchisees, vendors and employees, (ii) damage to the reputation of our brands (iii) damage to our relationship with our franchisees; (iv) interruption of our business; and (v) an event of default under our securitized debt agreements if a cybersecurity breach impacts our ability to comply with the terms of securitized debt agreements. We, our franchisees, third-party vendors and others with whom we may do business or interact with may have inadequate cyber liability insurance or coverage terms may be restrictive or insufficient to cover potential losses and remediation costs associated with a cyber incident.\nAs a merchant and service provider of point of sale related services, we and our franchisees are subject to PCI DSS, issued by the Payment Card Industry Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. Despite our cybersecurity measures and our efforts to comply with PCI DSS guidelines, we cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future.\nOur use of personal information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws and regulations, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation and could disrupt our operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act and pending California Privacy Rights Act, which require various processes and protections to be implemented.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business in international markets. Our expansion into and continued operations in international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation. There is no assurance that our international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue. Our international operations are subject to the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, issues with collections, international currency fluctuations, difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, terrorism, civil unrest, global travel risks and differing cultures and consumer preferences.\nWe also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, import/export/customs regulations, anti-boycott regulations, other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that could be time consuming, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We are involved in lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. There have been a growing number of lawsuits in recent years. There also has been a rise in employment-related lawsuits. From time to time, we have been subject to these types of lawsuits. The cost of defending claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims may harm our business and operating results. In addition, the increasingly regulated business environment may result in a greater number of enforcement actions and private litigation. This could subject us to increased exposure to stockholder lawsuits.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness, injury or other food quality, food safety, health or operational concerns as well as claims related to social issues (e.g., allegations of discrimination), the Americans with Disabilities Act and other premises liability. We and our franchisees are also subject to \"dram shop\" laws in some states pursuant to which we and our franchisees may be subject to liability in connection with personal injuries or property damages incurred in connection with wrongfully serving alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person.\nAlthough our franchise agreements require our franchisees to defend and indemnify us, we may be named as a defendant and sustain liability in legal proceedings against franchisees under the doctrines of vicarious liability, agency, negligence or otherwise. Claims against our franchisees may reduce the ability of our franchisees to make payments to us. We may also initiate legal proceedings against franchisees for breach of the terms of their franchise agreements, including underreporting of sales, failure to operate restaurants according to standard operating procedures and payment defaults. These claims also may reduce the ability of franchisees to enter into new franchise agreements with us.\nThird-party claims with respect to intellectual property assets, if decided against us, may result in competing uses or require adoption of new, non-infringing intellectual property, which may in turn adversely affect sales and revenues. We regard our service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. To protect our brands from infringement, we rely on contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and international jurisdictions; however, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us, or assert claims that our rights in our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property assets are invalid or unenforceable. Any such claims could have a material adverse effect on us or our franchisees if such claims were to be decided against us. If our rights in any intellectual property were invalidated or deemed unenforceable, it could permit competing uses\nof intellectual property which, in turn, could lead to a decline in restaurant revenues and sales of other branded products and services (if any). If the intellectual property became subject to third-party infringement, misappropriation or other claims, and such claims were decided against us, we may be forced to pay damages, be required to develop or adopt non-infringing intellectual property or be obligated to acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim. There could be significant expenses associated with the defense of any infringement, misappropriation, or other third-party claims.\nOur delivery initiatives and use of third-party delivery vendors subjects us and our franchisees to a variety of risks related to the delivery of our products by third parties and may not generate expected returns. There can be no assurance that delivery vendors will not take actions that could have a material adverse effect on our brands and or subject us to increased litigation and costs. Our delivery initiatives also introduce new operating procedures to our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants, which could adversely affect the business, brands, and the experience of our guests.\nOur business depends on the proper allocation of our human capital and our ability to attract and retain talented management and other key employees. We have dedicated brand resources for key functions such as marketing, consumer insights and operations and a shared service model for certain other functions such as legal, technology and human resources. There can be no assurance that our allocation of our human capital will effectively meet the needs of our business and brands. Further, our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled employees and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain management and other key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. The departure of a key executive or employee and/or the failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth transition upon such departure may be disruptive to the business and could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nOur failure or the failure of our franchisees to comply with federal, state and local governmental regulations may subject us to losses and harm our brands. We and our franchisees are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime, collective bargaining and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act (which provides civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations, and other areas), the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, collective bargaining and immigration status. There have been several complaints alleging franchisors to be joint employers with franchisees. Although we do not consider ourselves to be joint employers with our franchisees, there can be no assurance that other franchisors will not receive similar complaints in the future which may result in legal proceedings based on the actions of franchisees. Increases in payroll expenses as a result of any federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage or changes to the tip credit may negatively impact our and our franchisees\u2019 profitability. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration, collective bargaining and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages, unionization or increased team member turnover could also impact labor costs. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has impacted our franchisees\u2019 employee costs in some respects. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to food safety and inspection and the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Disruptions within any government agencies could impact the U.S. food industry, which may have an adverse effect on our business. We and our franchisees are also subject to laws and regulations relating to building and zoning requirements. Our and our franchisees' restaurants are also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We cannot assure you that we or our franchisees will not encounter material difficulties or failures, including with respect to obtaining and maintaining required licenses and approvals, which could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain restaurants, we and our franchisees may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state, local and international regulations. The inability to obtain or maintain such licenses or publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of such laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal regulation and certain foreign and state laws, including state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including provisions concerning the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some state franchise laws require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. The failure to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and the franchisees. Changes in, and the cost of compliance with, government regulations could have a material effect on operations.\nFinally, regulatory changes or actions under current or future U.S. political administrations may impact the laws or regulations described above. We cannot predict whether or when any of these potential changes in law might become effective in any jurisdiction nor the impact, if any, of these changes to our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with self-insurance for medical, dental and vision benefits. We self-insure all of our employee medical, dental and vision benefits. We maintain a per claim stop loss coverage but do not maintain coverage at an aggregate level. Our reserves are based on historical loss trends that may not correlate to actual loss experience in the future. If we experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, our reserves may prove to be insufficient and we may be exposed to significant and unexpected losses. For these and other reasons, including our inability to renew stop loss coverage at competitive rates, we are subject to risks associated with self-insurance that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, access to personal medical information is regulated by federal, state and/or local laws as well as by certain third-party agreements. If our security and information systems or the systems of our third-party vendors are compromised, we could be subject to costly litigation or penalties and our reputation and operations could be adversely affected.\nAny inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as an earthquake, tornado, flood or a man-made disaster, including terrorism, civil unrest or a cyber incident, at or affecting our corporate facilities could materially adversely impact our business. Our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support centers. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other natural or man-made disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nDevelopment initiatives outside our core business could negatively impact our brands. Our business expansion into non-traditional restaurant formats, including restaurants with a smaller footprint, restaurants located in non-traditional locations and restaurants that operate on a delivery-only and/or ghost kitchen basis, could create new risks to our brand and reputation.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Franchised Business Model\nRestaurant development plans under development agreements may not be implemented effectively and developed restaurants may not achieve desired results. We rely on franchisees to develop Applebee's and IHOP restaurants. From time to time, our franchisees have failed to fulfill their commitments to build new restaurants in the numbers and within the timeframes required by their development agreements, and we expect that this will continue to varying degrees in the future. Restaurant development and the success of restaurants opened by our franchisees involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022the demand for Applebee\u2019s and IHOP restaurants and the selection of appropriate franchisee candidates;\n\u2022costs of construction, permit issuance and regulatory compliance;\n\u2022the availability of suitable locations and terms for potential development sites, including lease or purchase terms for new locations;\n\u2022the availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third-party landlords, for restaurant development and/or implementation of our business strategy through new remodel programs and other operational changes;\n\u2022delays in obtaining construction permits and in completion of construction;\n\u2022competition for suitable development sites;\n\u2022changes in governmental rules, regulations, and interpretations (including interpretations of the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act); and\n\u2022general economic and business conditions.\nAdditionally, developed restaurants may not achieve desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened. This could result in restaurant closures, which may be significant in number, and may cause our royalty revenues and financial performance to decline. The inability to open new restaurants that achieve and sustain acceptable sales volumes and/or the closure of existing restaurants that do not achieve or sustain acceptable sales volumes may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are significantly franchised; as a result, we are highly dependent upon our franchisees. All IHOP and almost all Applebee\u2019s restaurants are owned and operated by our franchisees. Our dependence on our franchisees could adversely affect us, our brands, and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results are significantly contingent upon the performance of our franchised restaurants because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from royalties that are based on a percentage of gross sales at franchised restaurants. Worsening economic conditions and declining trends in sales, traffic and/or average check could impact the performance of our franchised restaurants, resulting in lower royalty, advertising fund and other payments from franchisees. If declining conditions persist, franchisee profitability and financial health may worsen and franchisees may suffer from financial, personal or other difficulties, including insolvency. Franchisees may also experience financial risks unrelated to the operation of restaurants under our brands, such as a decline in performance of other brands or businesses held by franchisees. Additionally, lenders to our franchisees may be less likely to provide current or prospective franchisees necessary financing on favorable terms, or at all, due to market conditions and our or our franchisees\u2019 operating results. These and other factors could impact franchisees\u2019 ability to make royalty and other payments owed to us when due and franchisees could default on their financial obligations to us. A decrease in franchisee profitability as well as other reasons could also cause franchisees\u2019 failure or inability to meet new restaurant development obligations and other obligations such as maintenance or remodel requirements and rent obligations for certain leases on which we retain contingent liability.\nAdditionally, our franchise agreements have expiration dates. Upon expiration, franchisees are generally required to enter into new franchise agreements in order to extend the franchise relationship. We or the franchisee may or may not elect to enter into these successor franchise agreements based on a number of factors, including a failure to meet our criteria, lack of interest by either party and/or the inability of franchisees to enter into successor franchise agreements. It is expected that, in the ordinary course of business, some franchise agreements will expire without successor franchise agreements. However, a substantial number of franchise agreements are set to expire in 2021 for Applebee\u2019s and 2024 through 2028 for IHOP, and while we have begun efforts to extend the terms of these franchise agreements, we cannot ensure that we and/or our franchisees will enter into successor franchise agreements or extensions once current terms expire. This may result in reduced royalties and other payments due to a decrease in the number of restaurants operating under our brands.\nAs independent third parties, franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants and their employees are not our employees. Accordingly, we do not control their actions. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, having almost all franchisee-operated restaurants may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of all of the restaurants. Franchisees may breach the terms of their franchise agreements in a manner that adversely affects our brands, such as failing to operate restaurants in accordance with our required standards, and we may be limited in our ability to enforce franchise obligations. Franchisees are required to conform to specified product quality standards and other requirements pursuant to their franchise agreements in order to protect our brands and to optimize restaurant performance. If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or customers have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our reputation and brands could suffer, and we could be subject to claims by guests even if we are not legally liable for the franchisee's actions or failure to act. This could result in a material adverse effect on our business. The quality of franchisees\u2019 operations may also be diminished by factors beyond our control, including a lack of investment in enhancing or maintaining acceptable standards for restaurant operations due to financial and other constraints. Franchisees also may fail or be unable to hire or retain qualified managers and other personnel and training of managers and other personnel may be inadequate. These and other such negative factors could reduce franchisees' restaurant revenues, impact payments to us under the franchise agreements and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nVarious other risks associated with the operation of a franchised business model that may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition include:\n\u2022inability or unwillingness of franchisees to participate in implementing changes or to participate in business strategy changes;\n\u2022inability or unwillingness of franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives;\n\u2022inability of franchisees to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints;\n\u2022failure of franchisees to report sales information accurately;\n\u2022greater proportional impact of general and administrative expenses on our business and financial condition; and\n\u2022inability to retain franchisees in the future, both in terms of number and quality, and inability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber, including top performing franchisees.\nWhile we try to maintain positive working relationships with our franchisees, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship inherently subjects us to potential disagreements with our franchisees on matters pertaining to the business and/or our brands. From time to time, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience, poor franchise relations caused by the efforts of one or more of our larger franchisees or an organized franchise association.\nConcentration of Applebee's franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees subjects us to greater risk. As of December 31, 2020, Applebee's franchisees operated 1,531 Applebee's restaurants in the United States. Of those restaurants, the ten largest Applebee's franchisees owned 1,160 restaurants, representing 76% of all franchised Applebee's restaurants in the United States. The largest Applebee's franchisee owned 444 restaurants, representing 29% of all franchised Applebee's restaurants in the United States. The concentration of franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees subjects us to a potentially higher level of risk with respect to such franchisees because their obligations to us, including financial obligations, are greater as compared to those franchisees with fewer restaurants. The risk associated with these franchisees is also greater where franchisees are the sole or dominant franchisee for a particular region of the United States, as is the case for most domestic Applebee's franchised territories. In particular, if any of these franchisees experience financial or other difficulties, the franchisee may default on its obligations under multiple franchise agreements, notes receivable or other agreements, including payments to us and the maintenance and improvement of its restaurants. From time to time, we may work with our franchisees who are experiencing financial difficulties to assess and address their financial health and their ability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. In certain of these situations, we may agree to alternative arrangements with franchisees for the payment of amounts due to us under our franchise and other agreements. We cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful, nor can we assure you that they will result in us receiving all or any of the amounts due to us under our franchise agreements,\nnotes receivable and other agreements. Any franchisee that owns and operates a significant number of Applebee's restaurants and fails to comply with other obligations under the franchise agreement, such as those relating to the quality and preparation of food and maintenance of restaurants, could cause significant harm to the Applebee's brand and subject us to claims by consumers even if we are not legally liable for the franchisee's actions or failure to act. Development rights for Applebee's restaurants are also concentrated among a limited number of existing franchisees. If any of these existing franchisees experience financial difficulties, future development of Applebee's restaurants may be materially adversely affected.\nAn insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent or delay the collection of payments or the exercise of rights under the related franchise agreement. An insolvency proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent or delay us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the related franchise agreement. If a franchisee is subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, a bankruptcy court may prevent the termination of the related franchise and development agreement. In particular, the protection of the statutory automatic stay that arises under Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by or against a franchisee may prohibit us from terminating a franchise agreement previously entered into with a franchisee. Furthermore, a franchisee that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings may reject the franchise agreement in which case we would be limited to a general unsecured claim against the franchisee's bankruptcy estate on account of breach-of-contract damages arising from the rejection. Payments previously made to us by a franchisee that is subject to a bankruptcy proceeding also may be recoverable from us on behalf of the franchisee as a preferential transfer under the United States Bankruptcy Code.\nWe are subject to credit risk from our IHOP franchisees operating under our Previous IHOP Business Model, and a default by these franchisees may negatively affect our cash flows. Prior to 2003, new IHOP restaurants were generally developed by us, and we were involved in all aspects of the construction and financing of the restaurants. We typically identified and leased or purchased the restaurant sites for new company-developed IHOP restaurants, built and equipped the restaurants and then franchised them to franchisees. In addition, we typically financed as much as 80% of the franchise fee for periods ranging from five to eight years and leased the restaurant and equipment to the franchisee over a 25-year period. Therefore, in addition to franchise fees and royalties, the revenues received from an IHOP franchisee operating under the Previous IHOP Business Model may include, among other things, lease or sublease rents for the restaurant property building, rent under an equipment lease and interest income from the financing arrangements for the unpaid portion of the franchise fee under the franchise notes. If any of these IHOP franchisees were to default on their payment obligations to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed under the building property lease/sublease agreement and our notes and equipment contract receivables, as well as outstanding franchise royalties. The additional amounts owed to us by each of these IHOP franchisees subject us to greater credit risk and defaults by IHOP franchisees operating under our Previous IHOP Business Model and may negatively affect our cash flows. Of the 1,518 IHOP domestic franchise restaurants as of December 31, 2020, approximately 620 restaurants have property lease/sublease agreements and/or notes and equipment contract obligations outstanding.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to potential losses that may not be covered by insurance. We and our franchisees may have insufficient insurance coverage to cover all of the potential risks associated with the ownership and operation of restaurants. We and our franchisees may have insufficient funds to cover future unanticipated increases in insurance premiums or losses that are not covered by insurance. Certain extraordinary hazards may not be insurable and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, there is no assurance that any loss incurred will not exceed the limits on the policies obtained, or that claim payments on such policies will be received on a timely basis. Further, there can be no assurance that any such payments, even if obtained on a timely basis, will prevent losses to franchisees or enable timely franchise payments. Accordingly, in cases in which a franchisee experiences increased insurance premiums or must pay claims out-of-pocket, the franchisee may not have the funds necessary to make franchise and other payments to us, and franchisees may be unable to perform other obligations under their franchise agreements.\nIf franchisees and other licensees do not observe the required quality and trademark usage standards, our brands may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn adversely affect our business. We license our intellectual property to our franchisees, product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, advertisers and other third parties. The franchise agreements and other license agreements require that each franchisee or other licensee use our intellectual property in accordance with established or approved quality control guidelines. However, there can be no assurance that the franchisees or other licensees will use the intellectual property assets in accordance with such guidelines. Franchisee and licensee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the governing franchise agreement or other license agreement may reduce the overall goodwill associated with our brands. Franchisees and other licensees may refer to our intellectual property improperly in communications, resulting in the weakening of the distinctiveness of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the franchisees or other licensees will not take actions that could have a material adverse effect on the Applebee's or IHOP intellectual property.\nIn addition, even if the licensee product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, or advertisers observe and maintain the quality and integrity of our intellectual property assets in accordance with the relevant license agreement, any product manufactured by such suppliers may be subject to regulatory sanctions and other actions by third parties which can, in turn, negatively impact the perceived quality of our restaurants and the overall goodwill of our brands, regardless of the nature and type of product involved. Any such sanctions or actions could reduce restaurant revenues and corresponding franchise payments to us.\nOur business strategy may not achieve anticipated results. We expect to continue to apply a business strategy that includes operation of a significantly franchised restaurant system across multiple brands and brand-specific business strategies suited to each brand. There can be no assurance that the business strategy we apply to one franchise system will be suitable or will achieve results similar to the application of such business strategy to another franchise system. In addition, operational improvement, purchasing and other strategic initiatives for any of our brands may not be successful or achieve the desired results, and there can be no assurance that franchisees will respond favorably to such initiatives. Additionally, our strategic initiatives may subject us and our franchisees to new and additional risks. Our business strategy includes the addition of new brands to our restaurant portfolio through mergers and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any such transaction will be successful or produce favorable financial or other results.\nRisks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the restaurant industry, including the highly competitive nature of the industry. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues in the form of (i) royalties based on the gross sales of our franchised restaurants and (ii) gross sales derived from company-operated restaurants. Sales and profitability of these restaurants may be negatively impacted by a number of factors associated with operating in the restaurant industry, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022changes in consumer behavior driven by macro-level shifts in retail, technology, media, e-commerce, global safety and demography which may impact where, when, whether and how often customers visit full-service restaurants;\n\u2022declines in comparable restaurant sales growth rates due to: (i) failure to meet or adequately adapt to changing customer expectations for food type, quality and taste, or to innovate and develop new menu items to retain existing customers and attract new customers; (ii) competitive intrusions in our markets, including competitive pricing initiatives and daypart expansion by competitors; (iii) opening new restaurants that cannibalize the sales of existing restaurants; (iv) failure of national or local marketing to be effective; and (v) natural or man-made disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022negative trends in operating expenses such as: (i) increases in food and other commodity costs or related distribution costs; (ii) increases in labor costs due to minimum wage and other employment laws or regulations, immigration reform, the potential impact of union organizing efforts and tight labor market conditions; and (iii) increases in other operating costs including advertising, utilities, lease-related expenses and credit card processing fees;\n\u2022the highly competitive nature of the restaurant and related industries with respect to, among other things: (i) price, service, location, personnel and the type and quality of food; (ii) the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services, as well as the continued expansion of restaurants into the breakfast daypart; (iii) the entry of major market players in non-competing industries into the food services market; (iv) the decline in the price of groceries which may increase the attractiveness of dining at home versus dining out; and (v) the emergence of new or improved technologies and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by such technology;\n\u2022the inability to increase menu pricing to offset increased operating expenses; and\n\u2022failure to effectively manage further penetration into mature markets.\nFactors outside our control may harm our brands' reputations. The success of our business is largely dependent upon brand recognition and the strength of our franchise systems. Our and our franchisees\u2019 continued success is directly dependent upon maintaining a favorable public view of the Applebee's and IHOP brands. Negative publicity (e.g., crime, scandal, litigation, on-site accidents and injuries or other harm to customers, social issues, and food-borne illness) at a single Applebee's or IHOP location can have a substantial negative impact on all restaurants within the Applebee's or IHOP system. Multi-unit food service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by widespread negative publicity of any type, including through social media, but particularly regarding food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering or preparation, obesity, discrimination or bias, injury or other health concerns with respect to certain foods and actions of our or our franchisees\u2019 managers or employees, regardless of whether such claims are accurate or valid.\nThe risk of food-borne illness or food tampering cannot be completely eliminated. Any outbreak of food-borne illness or other food-related incidents attributed to Applebee's or IHOP restaurants or within the food service industry or any widespread negative publicity regarding the Applebee's or IHOP brands or the restaurant industry in general could harm our reputation.\nEven where such food-related incidents occur solely at restaurants of our competitors or within the industry, our business could be adversely affected by negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally. Our company-owned restaurants and our franchisees may produce or receive through the supply chain sub-standard or non-compliant food or beverage products. In addition, our franchisees\u2019 failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements may subject us to potential losses, even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee's actions or failure to act. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, and each franchisee is required to maintain liability insurance pursuant to its franchise agreements, a liability claim could injure the reputation of all Applebee's or IHOP restaurants, whether or not it is ultimately successful.\nA lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations. The success of our brands depends in large part on restaurant locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Potential declines in neighborhoods where restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. Additionally, restaurant revitalization initiatives may not be completed as and when projected and may not produce the results we expect. We also may be unable to operate effectively in new and/or highly competitive geographic regions or local markets in which our franchisees have limited operating experience.\nWe may experience shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food and other products from third parties or in the availability of utilities. Our and our franchised restaurants are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh produce, food, beverages and other products. Shortages or interruptions in food and beverage supplies may result from a variety of causes, including shortages due to adverse weather, labor unrest, labor shortages, political unrest, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks of food-borne illness, disruption of operation of production facilities, financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) of our distributors or suppliers or other unforeseen circumstances. Such shortages could adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to operate our restaurants and, in turn, affect our and our franchisees\u2019 revenue and profits. Additionally, the inability to secure adequate and reliable supplies or distribution of food and beverage products could limit our ability to make changes to our core menus or offer promotional \"limited time only\" menu items, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategies. Our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants bear risks associated with the timeliness of deliveries by suppliers and distributors as well as the solvency, reputation, labor relationships, freight rates, prices of raw materials and health and safety standards of each supplier and distributor. Other significant risks associated with our suppliers and distributors include improper handling of food and beverage products and/or the adulteration or contamination of such food and beverage products. Disruptions in our relationships with suppliers and distributors may reduce the payments we receive from our franchisees or our pancake and waffle dry mix distributors or the profits generated by our company-operated restaurants. In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities may adversely affect the operations of our and our franchised restaurants.\nAny inability to effectively manage or forecast appropriate inventory levels may adversely affect our business. Effective management of inventory levels depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences. From time to time, we may carry excessive inventory resulting from menu events that vary from forecasted demand which may result in financial loss to us and/or to our franchisees. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may experience inventory shortages which may result in lost revenues.\nA failure to develop and implement innovative marketing and guest relationship initiatives, ineffective or improper use of social media or other marketing initiatives and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our business results. If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results. A failure to sufficiently innovate, develop guest relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests. These efforts may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues or increased employee engagement. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, posting of negative comments about our brands or experiences in our or our franchisees\u2019 restaurants, exposure of personal information, fraud, and use of outdated information. The use, including any inappropriate or otherwise harmful use, of social media vehicles by our franchisees and their employees, guests, our employees or others in the general public could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid Applebee's and IHOP restaurants in favor of alternative options. The food service industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels. Franchise development and system-wide sales depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors we do not control. New information regarding diet, nutrition and health and efforts by advocacy groups to influence consumer eating habits may negatively affect the demand for our food. Various additional factors such as: (i) the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s menu labeling rules, (ii) nutritional guidelines issued by the United States Department of Agriculture and issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by state or local municipalities, (iii) academic studies; or (iv) efforts by environmental, animal welfare and sustainability advocacy groups, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by Applebee's or IHOP restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt Applebee's or IHOP restaurants' menu offerings to keep pace with developments in consumer preferences, which may result in reduced royalty revenues from a decline in demand for our food and fewer guests visiting Applebee\u2019s and IHOP restaurants.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nDeclines in our financial performance have resulted in and could result in future impairment charges. United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require annual (or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant) impairment tests of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Generally speaking, if the carrying value of the asset is in excess of the estimated fair value of the asset, the carrying value will be adjusted to fair value through an impairment charge. Fair values of goodwill and intangible assets are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows based on five-year forecasts of financial results that incorporate assumptions including, among other things, same-restaurant sales trends, future development plans, brand-enhancing initiatives, restaurant closures and an appropriate discount rate. Fair values of long-lived tangible assets are primarily estimated using discounted cash flows over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Significant underachievement of forecasted results or changes in the discount rate assumption could reduce the estimated fair value of these assets below the carrying value, requiring non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of the asset. In the second quarter of 2020, as a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $92.2 million, an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $11.0 million and an impairment of various long-lived assets of $17.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, our total stockholders' deficit was $354.7 million. Any significant impairment write-down of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets in the future could increase the stockholders' deficit. Repurchases of our common stock will also increase the stockholders' deficit. While such a deficit balance does not create an event of default in any of our contractual agreements, the negative perception of such a deficit could have an adverse effect on our stock price and could impair our ability to obtain new financing, or refinance existing indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading volatility and price of our stock. Many factors, in addition to our operating results, may have an impact on the trading volatility and price of our common stock. These factors include general economic and market conditions, publicity regarding us, our competitors, or the restaurant industry generally, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices, trading activity in our common stock, overall liquidity and the impact of our capital allocation initiatives, including any future stock repurchase programs or dividend declarations. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any failure to meet market expectations whether for sales growth, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to decline.\nOur actual operating and financial results in any given period may differ from guidance we provide to the public, including our most recent public guidance. From time to time, in press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and other contexts, we have provided guidance to the public regarding current business conditions and our expectations for our future financial results. We expect that we will provide guidance periodically in the future. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions, expectations and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In providing our guidance, we also make various assumptions with respect to our future business decisions, some of which will change. Our actual financial results, therefore, may vary from our guidance due to our inability to meet the assumptions upon which our guidance is based and the impact on our business of the various risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors and in our public filings with the SEC. Variances between our actual results and our guidance may be material. To the extent that our actual financial results do not meet or exceed our guidance, the trading prices of our securities may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76732, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "DIN"}
