{"cik": "1297336", "company": "ReachLocal Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including declining revenue, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate. We commenced operations in late 2004 in North America, and developed a strategy for taking advantage of what we believe is a shift of local marketing budgets from traditional media formats to digital media formats. Our strategy allowed us to grow rapidly. However, our growth rate slowed over a number of years and in 2015 and 2014 our revenue declined 19.4% and 7.6%, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we exited direct sales in the U.K. market, which represented 6.6% of 2015 revenue and we continue to review our international operations in order to rationalize our operations in underperforming markets. We are introducing products internationally, continuing to refine the structure of our sales force and introducing new go-to-market strategies, and developing new products to attempt to grow our business, but we cannot assure you that our strategy will be successful and that our revenue will not decline further. In particular, although our international salespeople historically were more productive than our North American salespeople, as those markets have matured, our international salespeople\u2019s productivity has declined and may decline further, putting further pressure on our results of operations. As our revenues have declined we have reduced costs to maintain economic viability, but if revenues continue to decline, we may not be able to implement enough additional cost savings to sustain the business.\nYou must also consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter as a company in the rapidly evolving online marketing industry. These risks and difficulties include:\n\u2022\nour limited number of product offerings and the difficulties and risks associated with developing and selling new products and solutions, including, in particular, new subscription and software-as-a-service (SaaS) products;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully executing new sales and go-to-market strategies and approaches, including the realignment of our North American sales force;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully entering new markets, domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the effectiveness of our technology platform, and adapting our technology to new market opportunities and challenges;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing and new competitors, technologies, and products;\n\u2022\nreaching and maintaining profitability;\n\u2022\nmaintaining compliance with debt covenants;\n\u2022\nacquiring additional capital, if necessary;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to attract new clients, many of which have not previously advertised online and may not understand the value to their businesses of our products and services; and\n\u2022\neffectively managing our sales force, personnel and operations.\nFailing to successfully address these challenges or others could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $136.1 million, and we may incur significant net operating losses in the future. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased from $43.7 million as of December 31, 2014 to $18.8 million as of December 31, 2015, which includes the amounts borrowed under our Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital (the \u201cHercules Loan Agreement\u201d) ($10 million of unrestricted cash) and pursuant to the 4.0% Convertible Second Lien Subordinated Notes issued to certain affiliates of VantagePoint Capital Partners (the \u201cVantagePoint Notes\u201d) ($5 million). Although we have significantly reduced, and are attempting to further reduce, our operating expenses, we may not be successful or our operating expenses may increase in the future as we expand our operations. In addition, our business strategy contemplates making substantial investments in new and existing products, which will require significant expenditures. If our expenses don\u2019t decrease according to our plan or revenues are less than expected, we will not be profitable and our liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected. We also expect that a variety of factors, including increased competition and the maturation of our business, may continue to put pressure on our revenue, and we cannot assure you that our revenue will not continue to decline. As a result, you should not consider our historical revenue performance as indicative of our future performance.\nOur Hercules Loan Agreement and VantagePoint Notes contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nBorrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. The Hercules Loan Agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries which are co-borrowers under the loan, and in certain cases, to all of our subsidiaries. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on investments in and cash held at foreign subsidiaries, transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets, and undergoing a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We are also required to maintain minimum cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to a control agreement with Hercules, as administrative agent, in an amount equal to $15.0 million (which decreases to $12.5 million under certain circumstances) at all times. The term loan is secured by substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property.\nIn addition, the Hercules Loan Agreement requires performance within certain trailing-three-month revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets, computed on a monthly basis. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Loan Agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. During 2015 we entered into several amendments to the Hercules Loan Agreement that allowed us to maintain compliance with the term loan\u2019s covenants, including an amendment on August 3, 2015 to reduce the term loan\u2019s covenant thresholds for revenue for the months ending September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and an amendment on November 9, 2015, to waive compliance with the term loan\u2019s revenue and earnings covenant thresholds for November and December 2015. In connection with the November amendment, we paid Hercules a one-time fee of $0.2 million, reset the schedule of prepayment fees, and agreed to amend the Hercules warrant to lower the exercise price and increase the number of shares subject to it. A breach of any of the Hercules Loan Agreement covenants could result in a default under the Hercules Loan Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the term loan to become immediately due and payable and Hercules could exercise remedies against the collateral securing the term loan, including our cash, or could result in the interest-only extension period being unavailable to us.\nThe VantagePoint Notes also include events of default, including any event of default under the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when they mature or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe cannot be certain that the significant steps that we have taken to strengthen our North American market will work.\nCommencing in the fourth quarter of 2013, we realigned our sales infrastructure in North America, which we believe significantly contributed to our 2014 and 2015 revenue declines. In 2015, we further refined the structure of our sales force to combine the best elements of our original sales model and our more recent sales model. We believe the current North American sales model is superior to the prior model, but we cannot be certain that this continued evolution will slow the declines and ultimately return our North American operations to growth.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and our workforce has undergone significant disruption which may adversely affect performance and tenure.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, technical and finance personnel. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. All of our U.S. officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we are unable to attract and retain our executive officers and key employees, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\n2014 and 2015 were very difficult years for our business. Our operating and stock price performance have resulted in a drop in morale within our work force. While we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that our key people are adequately incented to stay with the company, we cannot be certain that such incentives will be sufficient to keep our top performers.\nVolatility or lack of performance in our stock price and limitations imposed by the size of our equity plan may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. In addition, as some of our executive officers become vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options, if our stock price appreciates significantly they may be more likely to leave us as their equity holdings become valuable.\nOur product roadmap relies on developing a total marketing solution, which is a somewhat untested product concept that may not gain market acceptance or may not perform as we intend.\nReachEdge, our lead conversion software, is our initial step towards our goal of offering a total marketing solution. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014 we acquired Kickserv, a business management platform for service businesses that we are beginning to integrate with ReachEdge. The success of this new product strategy is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, such as uncertain customer acceptance, the difficulties of designing a complex software product, integrating our software products with our existing technology and third-party service providers, training our salespeople to sell software products, and gaining market acceptance. We are also still developing our go-to market strategy for our software business, which has different requirements than our traditional media business. Because our software products are complex and incorporate a variety of proprietary and third-party software, they may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. In addition, our customers may use our software products in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers may use this product for important aspects of their business, such as lead generation, lead management, scheduling, and other services, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems, could damage our customers\u2019 businesses and result in financial losses, which would hurt our reputation. As a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us. In addition, our total marketing solution is a relatively new solution for the marketplace and, therefore, wide market acceptance cannot be assured. Substantial components of our software products may be outsourced to third parties. While we believe that our relationships with these third parties are sound, if one of those relationships were to deteriorate, our ability to sell and maintain our software products could be substantially degraded.\nWe purchase most of our media from Google, and our business could be adversely affected if Google takes actions that are adverse to our interests or if we fail to meet advertiser or spend targets necessary for receiving rebates from Google. Similar actions from Yahoo!, Microsoft and other media providers could adversely affect our business, though to a lesser degree.\nMost of our cost of revenue is for the purchase of media, and a substantial majority of the media we purchase is from Google. Google accounts for a large majority of all U.S. searches, and Google\u2019s share in foreign markets is often even greater. As a result, we expect that our business will depend upon media purchases from Google for the foreseeable future. This dependence makes us vulnerable to actions that Google may take to change the manner in which it sells AdWords, as described below, or conducts its business on a number of levels:\n\u2022\nGoogle Can Choose to Change the Terms and Conditions Upon Which it Does Business with Us and our Clients. Google can act unilaterally to change the terms and conditions for our purchase of media or the purchase of Google products, and Google has done so in the past. Future changes by Google to the terms and conditions upon which we purchase media could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nCompetitive Risk. Google offers its products directly to local businesses through an online self-service option. In addition, Google has continued to expand its partner program, which we believe has attracted additional competitors to enter our market. Google enjoys substantial competitive advantages over us, such as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, Google continues to launch products that are targeted directly at SMBs, which Google does not always make available to third parties. While we cannot assess at this time the effect of Google\u2019s offering such products directly to SMBs, the prices charged by Google for direct service are lower than the prices we charge for the same media.\n\u2022\nTechnology Risk. Our technology platform interacts with Google through publicly available application programming interfaces, or APIs. If Google were to discontinue the availability of all or a portion of these APIs to us, we may have to change our technology, incur additional costs or discontinue certain products or services that we currently offer our clients. Any of these changes could adversely affect our ability to provide effective online marketing and reporting solutions to our clients. In addition, Google may decide to alter the amount it charges us for the right to use its APIs, which would decrease our gross margin absent any change in our pricing to our customers.\n\u2022\nEditorial Control. Google closely monitors the experience of end-users, and from time-to-time, its editorial personnel request that companies alter their services based on Google\u2019s determination that aspects of such services could adversely affect the end-user experience and/or avoid providing Google-dependent services to certain types of clients. For example, each of our media products includes TotalTrack, a tracking service powered by our proprietary reverse proxy technology and tracking code. If Google were to determine that the tracking URLs utilized by our TotalTrack service adversely affects the end-user\u2019s experience, Google could require us to alter or suspend the way we implement our tracking solutions. Such a change would significantly decrease our ability to optimize our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns and limit our ability to provide the level of campaign performance reporting that we currently provide to our clients.\n\u2022\nRebate/Incentive Risk. Google retains broad authority with respect to its rebate programs and has, from time to time, canceled rebate programs. During 2014, we entered into a new global agreement with Google that provides rebates based on overall global growth of our spending with Google. We amended the terms of our Google agreement in December 2015, and during the fourth quarter of 2015 we earned a rebate well in excess of the amount we have received in recent quarters. The December 2015 amendment only applies through the end of 2016 and we can provide no assurance that we will qualify for rebates under the current Google agreement or otherwise in the future. Even if we earn rebates from Google in the future, the agreement is subject to broad mutual termination rights and there is no assurance of renewal. Termination or nonrenewal of the Google agreement would negatively affect our cost of revenue materially.\nIn addition, any new developments or rumors of developments regarding Google\u2019s business practices that affect the local online advertising industry may adversely affect our products or create perceptions with our customers or investors that our ability to compete has been impaired. For instance, beginning in February 2016, Google began changing where and how ads are shown next to search results, potentially significantly reducing the number of ad impressions available to advertisers, including our clients.\nThe above risks also apply to other publishers from whom we purchase media, including Yahoo! and Microsoft.\nWe purchase a significant majority of our media from Google, Microsoft and Yahoo! in an auction marketplace. If we are unable to purchase media from any one of these companies, if prices for media significantly increase or if the manner in which the media is sold changes, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to purchase media from Google, Microsoft and Yahoo! at reasonable prices so that we can provide our clients with a reasonable return on the advertising expenditures they make through us. We generally purchase this media in an auction marketplace. Increased competition or other factors may cause the cost of the media that we purchase from Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft to rise. In particular, if our expectation that local SMB advertising will increasingly migrate to the Internet is correct, the marketing budget available to bid in these auctions will increase and the price of media may increase substantially. An increase in the cost of media in these marketplaces without a corresponding increase in our media buying efficiency could result in an increase in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue even if our business expands. In addition, such an increase could result in an increase in the prices we must charge our clients or a decrease in our ability to fulfill our clients\u2019 service expectations. Furthermore, the Internet search companies that operate these media marketplaces may change the operating rules or bidding procedures in ways that decrease the effectiveness of the technology that we use to optimize our purchases or otherwise prevent us from purchasing media at reasonable prices or at all. Any change in our ability to provide effective online marketing campaigns to our clients may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, which may adversely impact our margins and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for online marketing solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, and with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. In particular, some of our competitors offer products similar to ours at a lower price, putting pressure on us to lower our prices or lose clients.\nOur competitors include:\n\u2022\nInternet Online Publishers. We compete with large Internet marketing providers such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft. These providers typically offer their products and services through disparate, online-only, self-service platforms.\n\u2022\nTraditional, Offline Media Companies. We compete with traditional yellow page, newspaper, television and radio companies that, in many cases, have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties.\n\u2022\nLocal SMB Marketing Providers. The market for internet marketing services is highly fragmented and there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services and offer such services at highly competitive prices. Many of these partners also participate in publisher partner programs, which allows them to compete with us more effectively.\n\u2022\nSMB Marketing Technology Providers. We also compete with technology companies providing online marketing platforms focused on the SMB market such as Angie\u2019s List, Groupon, Intuit, Web.com, Wix, and Yelp, and, in some cases, building significant direct sales forces.\n\u2022\nNew Competitors in New Markets. In late 2013 we launched ReachEdge, our lead conversion software-as-a-service, or SaaS, product, and in late 2014, we acquired Kickserv, business management software for service businesses. We are also developing other new subscription and SaaS products designed to provide SMBs additional tools to convert leads to customers, retain customers, and transact with customers. In each case, as we enter new markets we will encounter new competitors.\nMany of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, technical and other resources and, in some cases, the ability to combine their online marketing products with traditional offline media such as newspapers or yellow pages. These companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. In particular, if major Internet search companies such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft decide to devote greater resources to develop and market online advertising offerings directly to SMBs, greater numbers of our clients and potential clients may choose to purchase online advertising services directly from these competitors, particularly if and as the ease of their self-service models increases. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships with and access to larger client bases and are heavily investing in recruiting sales personnel, which might affect our ability to achieve our salespeople hiring targets.\nAs the market for local online advertising increases, we expect new competitors, business models and solutions to emerge, some of which may be superior to ours. We also believe that the marketplace for online media is more transparent than other media marketplaces. Our competitors may use information available to them to price their products at a discount to the prices that we currently offer. Clients and potential clients might adopt competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our solutions, even if our online marketing and reporting solutions are more effective than those offered by our competitors, if we are not able to differentiate our products and convince clients that our products are more effective than our competitors\u2019 offerings. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to effectively develop and sell additional products and solutions.\nWe invest in the development of new products and solutions with the expectation that we will be able to effectively offer them to our clients. We are developing, and may in the future develop or acquire, other products and solutions that address new segments of local companies\u2019 marketing activities. We are also developing subscription and SaaS products, such as ReachEdge and Kickserv, which present different challenges from those we have faced in the past. Our future revenue depends in part on our ability to stay competitive with our product and service offerings, including providing integrated solutions to our clients. Our ability to develop and launch new products on our expected timelines, or at all, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, such as our decreased product and technology spending, the difficulties of designing complex software products, achieving desired functionality and integrating the new products with our existing technology.\nThe sale of new or additional features, products and services, the value or utility of which may be different from our current products and services or less easily understood by our clients, may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and increased operating expenses, as well as additional training of our salespeople and education for our SMB clients. New product launches require the investment of resources in advance of any revenue generation. If new products fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never realize a return on this investment. If these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. Many SMBs have modest advertising budgets. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our SMB clients will increase their aggregate spending as a result of the introduction of new products and services or that the successful introduction of new products or services will not adversely affect sales of our current products and services through cannibalization of our current products or disharmony created by consumer offerings that could be perceived as in competition with our current customers. Any such adverse impact on our current media products could also adversely affect our publisher rebates.\nWe may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to operate or expand our business. In addition, some of our product development initiatives may require substantial additional capital resources before they begin to generate material revenue. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. The Hercules Loan Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional capital without Hercules\u2019 consent or payment in full. If we do not have funds available to enhance our solutions, maintain the competitiveness of our technology or pursue business opportunities, we may not be able to service our existing clients or acquire new clients, which would have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nClient dissatisfaction with our products, complaints, negative publicity or litigation related to our sales tactics, customer service or other business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand.\nClient dissatisfaction with our products, client complaints or negative publicity, including third-party media outlets, about our products, technology, personnel or customer service, could severely diminish confidence in and the use of our products. Our products, as well as those of our competitors, are regularly reviewed, and those reviews are regularly shared, by our clients. Negative reviews, or reviews in which our competitors\u2019 products are rated more highly than ours, could negatively affect our brand and reputation. From time to time, our clients have expressed dissatisfaction, including dissatisfaction with our customer service, our sales and billing practices and the way our products perform. If we do not handle client complaints effectively, or otherwise adequately address clients\u2019 concerns, our brand and reputation may suffer, we may lose our clients\u2019 confidence and they may choose to stop working with us. For example, we experienced negative publicity in the United Kingdom, which adversely impacted our business in that region and contributed to our decision to exit the market in 2015. We have also faced legal claims regarding our business practices in both the United Kingdom and the United States and may face additional claims in the future. Complaints, negative publicity or legal claims related to our products, our sales tactics or our customer service could materially and adversely impact our reputation and brand, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in managing or growing our international operations, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently have international sales operations in Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil, Austria and Mexico, and campaign support services in India. Revenue from international operations outside North America accounted for 34.9%, 38.3% and 33.5% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We exited the United Kingdom market in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continue to review our international operations in order to rationalize our operations in overseas markets we determine to be underperforming and to optimize operations in our primary markets. We may continue to incur losses or fail to enter new markets successfully.\nOur ability to operate internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources, the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future and competitive environments with which we are unfamiliar. Our international operations may not prove to be successful in certain or any markets. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets. Our current and any future international expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. Furthermore, in many international markets, we would not be the first entrant, and greater competition may exist with stronger brand recognition than we have faced in our current markets. Different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws in foreign countries may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nOur international operations may also fail to succeed due to other risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in developing a network of clients in one or more international markets;\n\u2022\nlegal, political or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to market products and services or otherwise do business in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements, including regulation of internet services, privacy and data protection, banking and money transmitting, and selling, that may limit or prevent the offering of our products in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ninternational intellectual property laws that may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property or permit us to successfully defend ourselves or our intellectual property in international lawsuits;\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions, which could make it more difficult to terminate underperforming salespeople;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar, which can increase costs of international expansion;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences, including the difficulty of repatriating money;\n\u2022\nlack of infrastructure to adequately conduct electronic commerce transactions; and\n\u2022\nprice controls or other restrictions on foreign currency.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to continue or expand our international operations and replicate our business model, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately recruit, train and retain our salespeople would impede our strategy and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain or grow revenue and achieve profitability will depend, in part, on the size and effectiveness of our direct sales force. During 2015, we refined the structure of our North American sales force to combine the best elements of our original sales model and our 2014 sales model. In addition, we are now standardizing our international sales models to use localized versions of our North American sales model. However, if many of our salespeople do not perform well in their new roles, or are unhappy with the new structure, we may experience greater than anticipated attrition. If our salespeople attrition is greater than anticipated, our business will be harmed. We also have certain long-tenured salespeople with significant client bases and losses of one or more of them would negatively impact our business. In addition, as more companies seek to capitalize on the shift to online media, competition for knowledgeable and qualified online media sales personnel will increase, and hiring salespeople may be more difficult than it has been historically. Moreover, employees that we hire from our competitors have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims of breach of noncompetition and non-solicitation obligations owed to their former employers, which could impact our ability to attract and hire high-quality candidates and potentially subject us to litigation. If we are unable to effectively recruit, train and retain salespeople, we may not be able to grow our sales force, our revenue may suffer or our costs may increase.\nOne of our international growth strategies has been to enter new international markets through franchise or reseller arrangements, but that strategy is subject to risks.\nAs we expand into other international markets, in addition to entering markets directly, we may enter through a franchisee or a reseller (as we did in New Zealand and Eastern Europe and are currently operating in Singapore). The success of this strategy will depend on a number of factors, including whether our franchisees and resellers have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives, and the potential impact on us if they experience operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise, or are costly to exercise. Difficulties of one or more of our international franchisee or reseller arrangements could result in losses stemming from related strategic investments, delay penetration into and/or negatively affect our brand in certain international markets, and distract management and absorb product development resources. For example, in July 2012, the Company entered into a franchise agreement with OxataSMB B.V. permitting it to operate and resell our services under the ReachLocal brand in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia. At the same time, we entered into a market development loan agreement with OxataSMB pursuant to which we agreed to provide financing to OxataSMB of up to \u20ac2.9 million ($3.7 million), of which \u20ac1.45 million ($1.9 million) was immediately advanced and \u20ac0.92 million ($1.2 million) was advanced in August 2013. The OxataSMB operations did not perform as contemplated, and as a result, the Company recorded a $3.3 million impairment of the loan receivable and related interest from OxataSMB and a $1.6 million provision for bad debt related to the trade receivable from OxataSMB. Ultimately we terminated OxataSMB\u2019s franchise agreement in the fourth quarter of 2014 and have not been repaid any amounts under the loan.\nMore consumers are using devices other than personal computers to access the Internet and accessing new platforms to make search queries. If we are unable to effectively reach consumers on the Internet on behalf of our customers, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones and tablets, has increased dramatically in the past few years. Mobile search advertising is growing very rapidly and may offer lower conversion rates for our customers, which if not offset by lower costs, may make search engine marketing less attractive for our customers. In addition, the lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices may alter consumers\u2019 use of the Internet, including search engines and other websites where we publish advertisements on behalf of customers. For example, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via \u201capps\u201d tailored to particular devices or niches, or via social media platforms, which could affect our ability to deliver advertising results to our clients if we are unable to effectively reach consumers via those apps.\nThe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on advertising budgets, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of advertising. In addition, as we increase our international footprint, we will become more sensitive to economic conditions outside of North America. We believe that the economic conditions remain challenging in North America and internationally, which have adversely affected our business.\nTo the extent that economic difficulties continue, or worldwide economic conditions materially deteriorate, our existing and potential clients may no longer consider investment in our online marketing solutions a necessity, or may elect to reduce advertising budgets. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending. In particular, online marketing advertising solutions may be viewed by some of our existing and potential clients as a lower priority and may be among the first expenditures reduced as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. These developments could cause us to respond by temporarily reducing hiring or taking other measures and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Our foreign operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income (or loss). If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, however, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenue, operating expenses and net income (or loss). For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we do business resulted in a reduction in 2015 revenue of $25.9 million, principally driven by a 16% reduction in the average value of the Australian dollar relative to the prior year. As exchange rates vary, sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. In addition, approximately 30% of our cash balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the value of such holdings will increase or decrease along with the weakness or strength of the U.S. dollar, respectively. We continue to review potential hedging strategies that may reduce the effect of fluctuating currency rates on our business, but there can be no assurances that we will implement such a hedging strategy or that once implemented, such a strategy would accomplish our objectives or not result in losses.\nIf we fail to stabilize our client base, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business depends in large part on maintaining and expanding our client base. To do so, we must convince prospective clients of the benefits of our technology platform and existing clients of the continuing value of our products and services. As the online media options for SMBs have proliferated and our sales force has shrunk, our number of Active Clients has fallen from 23,900 as of December 31, 2013 to 20,800 as of December 31, 2014 and 17,500 as of December 31, 2015. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding our client base in the future.\nSMB marketing and advertising campaigns are often sporadic and difficult to predict, as they may be driven by seasonal promotions or business dynamics, evolving product and service offerings, available budgets and other factors. Some SMBs advertise only periodically, such as to promote sales or special offers. Because we need to address these business considerations of our clients, we do not require clients to enter into long-term obligations to purchase our products and services. Many cancel soon after completing their initial contract terms and some cancel early. We must continually add new clients both to replace clients who choose to cancel or not to renew their advertising campaigns and to grow our business beyond our current client base. A client\u2019s decision to cancel or not to renew may be based on a number of factors, including dissatisfaction with our products and services, inability to continue operations and spending levels or because their campaigns were event-driven or otherwise intentionally limited in scope or duration. If our clients increasingly fail to fulfill their contracts or increasingly do not renew their advertising campaigns with us, or if we are unable to attract new clients in numbers greater than the number of clients that we lose, our client base will decrease and our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated by our national brands, agencies and resellers. If we are not able to maintain relationships with them, our sales may suffer and it may contribute to further revenue declines.\nWe distribute our products and services through a separate sales force for national brands with operations in multiple local markets, as well as select third-party agencies and resellers. More generally, because national brands, agencies and resellers typically represent an aggregated group of SMB clients, if our relationship with one or more of these persons or companies were restricted or terminated, our sales would decrease and our revenue would be adversely affected, potentially materially. In addition, our strategy of distributing our products and services to our clients through our Direct Local channel and through our National Brands, Agencies and Resellers channel may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our Direct Local sales efforts may compete with our third-party agency and resellers and, to the extent different third-party agencies and resellers target the same clients, they may also come into conflict with each other. While we have certain policies in place to address these potential conflicts, there can be no assurance that these channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our relationship with existing third-party agencies and resellers or adversely affect our ability to attract new third-party agencies and resellers. In the event that any of our relationships with existing third-party agencies and resellers are terminated or we are unable to attract new third-party agencies and resellers as a result of these distribution channel conflicts, our sales may suffer and our revenue may decline.\nIf SMBs increasingly opt to perform advertising tasks on their own, their demand for our products and services would decrease, negatively affecting our revenue.\nLarge Internet marketing providers such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft offer online advertising products and services through self-service platforms. As SMBs become more familiar with and experienced in interacting online, they may prefer to actively manage their own Internet presence and their demand for our products and services may decrease. We cannot predict the evolving experiences and preferences of SMBs, which may become more fully integrated into digitized modes of commerce and communication, and cannot assure you that we can develop our products and services in a manner that will suit their needs and expectations faster or more effectively than our competitors, or at all. If we are not able to do so, our results of operations would suffer.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nunilateral actions taken by Google or other media providers;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in advertising budgets and media pricing;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in salespeople hiring;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which SMBs migrate their advertising spending online;\n\u2022\nthe timing and stage of product and technology development;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and manage SaaS products;\n\u2022\nthe impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the relative strength of the US Dollar to the currencies in the countries in which we do business and its impact on our consolidated revenues and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions on our revenue and expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing of and our ability to enter new markets and manage expansion in new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to appropriately set the price of non-media products;\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses;\n\u2022\nthe attraction and retention of qualified employees and key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our reputation;\n\u2022\nthe effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting our business.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance. In addition, our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors.\nOur expense reduction initiatives may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in the size and complexity of our business. This growth has placed significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. However, during the past few years we have implemented a number of expense reduction initiatives, which may make it more difficult for us to continue to maintain, improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure. Expense constraints could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our clients, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. If we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur ability to introduce new solutions and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop new solutions, features and enhancements to our marketing system. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop our solutions internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our products depends upon the quality, availability, policies and prices of certain third-party service providers.\nWe rely on third parties to provide technology and services that are integrated into our solutions. Examples include our call tracking and recording services, and certain aspects of our software products. In certain geographies, we rely on a single service provider for some of these services. In the event the provider were to terminate our relationship or stop providing these services, our ability to provide the affected products could be impaired. We may not be able to find an alternative provider in time to avoid a disruption of our services or at all, and we cannot be certain that such provider\u2019s services would be compatible with our products without significant modifications or cost, if at all. Our proxy servers, which underlie key elements of our tracking services, require the use of various domains and IP address blocks. If domain registrars, website hosting companies or Internet service providers determined that our use of such domains and IP blocks were in violation of their terms of service or internet policies, such companies could elect to block our traffic. For example, several website hosting companies have blocked traffic from our reverse proxy servers for a group of our SMB clients, resulting in our inability to provide our full tracking services to those clients. Our ability to address or mitigate these risks may be limited. The failure of all or part of our tracking services could result in a loss of clients and associated revenue and could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on bandwidth providers, data centers and other third parties for key aspects of the process of providing online marketing solutions to our clients, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could harm our ability to operate our business and damage our reputation.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, including data center, software as a service, cloud computing Internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers. Any disruption in the services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict. We exercise little control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services could negatively impact our relationship with our clients and adversely affect our brand and our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.\nWe rely on a number of financial services providers, both domestically and internationally, for banking, payment processing and other financial transaction support and any interruption in the services provided by these institutions could harm our ability to operate our business.\nWe rely on a number of financial services providers, both domestically and internationally, for banking, payment processing and other financial transaction support. If one or more of our financial services providers reduces some or all of the services available to us due to our financial position or otherwise, it could significantly harm our business by requiring us to change current processes to less efficient models or expend considerable resources to migrate to a different provider. For example, during the first quarter of 2016, one of our primary banking partners reduced the services available to us and one of our primary payment processors gave us notice of their intent to terminate the relationship. We have been in discussions with alternate financial service providers and believe that we will not have an interruption of service, but if no alternative financial service provider is available or we cannot migrate in time, we could have difficulty collecting payments from our clients or could fail to remain in compliance with the covenants under our Hercules Loan Agreement.\nRapid technological changes may render our lead generation and conversion solutions obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our solutions to our clients.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our technology platform. The Internet, access to the Internet and the online marketing and advertising industry are rapidly changing. Our competitors are constantly developing new products and services in online marketing and advertising. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that clients can easily and effectively use. If competitors introduce new solutions embodying new technologies, or if new industry practices emerge, our existing technology may become obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\nenhance our existing solutions;\n\u2022\ndevelop new solutions and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective clients; and\n\u2022\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nDeveloping our online marketing and reporting solutions and the underlying technology entail significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt our technology platform and network infrastructure to client requirements or emerging industry practices. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced solutions, our clients may forego the use of our solutions in favor of those of our competitors.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our offerings and markets and grow our business in response to changing technologies, client demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the company that we acquired, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us. We may also inherit liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, intellectual property disputes, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities. In addition, we may borrow to complete an acquisition, which would increase our costs, or issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Historically, we have primarily grown organically, rather than through acquisitions. As a result, we have somewhat limited experience in identifying and executing acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions which could harm our operating results.\nWe make strategic investments from time to time and if they are unsuccessful, it could harm our financial condition.\nWe have made strategic investments in the past, such as the market development loan to OxataSMB, a franchisee, and may make additional similar or different strategic investments in the future. Such investments may not prove profitable or successful for us and may result in the partial or total loss of our invested capital. For example, the OxataSMB operations did not perform as contemplated, and as a result, at December 31, 2013, the Company recorded a $3.3 million impairment of the OxataSMB loan receivable and related interest and a $1.6 million provision for bad debt related to a trade receivable from OxataSMB. In addition, strategic investments may involve future commitments to provide further capital and we cannot assure you any such further investments will be desirable if, and when made, or will prove profitable over the long term.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage will likely be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential intellectual property or client data. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting the Los Angeles area, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high quality customer service, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a client\u2019s data, our service may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our service.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of clients\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. Our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud.\nIf our security measures are breached in the future as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our clients\u2019 data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients.\nWe provide services to clients in regulated industries (such as healthcare, financial and legal) in the United States and internationally. Clients in these regulated industries often have additional country-specific statutory and customer-specific contractual requirements. If we are not able to meet these changing requirements we could face litigation and could lose customers in those industries.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments we accept. If we fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may incur additional fees, fines and ultimately, the revocation of the right to use the credit card company, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA majority of our clients\u2019 campaigns were paid for using a credit card or debit card. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe we are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which incorporates Visa\u2019s Cardholder Information Security Program, MasterCard\u2019s Site Data Protection standard, and American Express\u2019 Data Security Operating Policy and Discover Information Security & Compliance (DISC) program. However, there is no guarantee that we will maintain such compliance or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment system. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our clients. A failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would result in significantly higher credit card-related costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to charge sales tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales to customers located in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax.\nWe have not historically collected, or had imposed upon us, sales or other transaction taxes related to the products and services we sell, except for certain corporate level taxes and transaction level taxes outside of the United States. However, sales of our ReachEdge and Kickserv products are taxable in many state, local, and foreign jurisdictions, of which one or more may seek to impose additional sales or other transaction tax obligations on us in the future. A successful assertion by any state, local jurisdiction or country in which we do business that we should be collecting sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales, create increased administrative burdens or costs, discourage clients from purchasing products or services from us, decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations. The imposition of new laws requiring the collection of sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services (or the introduction of new products or services that are subject to existing transaction taxes) could create increased administrative burdens or costs, discourage clients from purchasing products or services from us, decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe intended tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are intended to reduce our worldwide effective tax rate. The application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nOur corporate structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our intercompany arrangements allocate income to such entities in accordance with arm\u2019s-length principles and commensurate with functions performed, risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets. We believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the U.S. statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In particular, there is uncertainty in relation to the U.S. tax legislation in terms of the future corporate tax rate but also in terms of the U.S. tax consequences of income derived from intellectual property related income earned overseas in low tax jurisdictions.\nOur existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax benefits which we intend to eventually derive could be undermined if we are unable to adapt the manner in which we operate our business and due to changing tax laws.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nBecause our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property, including our proprietary technology, the protection of our intellectual property rights is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patent applications, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions, to safeguard our intellectual property. These afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our online marketing and reporting solutions, technology, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. In particular, because we sell our solutions internationally, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur proprietary technology is not currently protected by any issued patents, and policing our rights to such technology may be hindered if we are unable to obtain any patents. In addition, the type and extent of patent claims that may be issued to us in the future is uncertain, and any patents that are issued may not contain claims that permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology. In light of the costs of obtaining patent protection, at times we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later on prove to be highly important. To the extent that the various technologies underlying any patent applications are determined to be business methods, the law around these types of patents is rapidly developing, and pending changes may impact our ability to protect our technology and proprietary use thereof through patents.\nWe have registered ReachLocal and other trademarks as trademarks in the United States and in certain other countries. Some of our trade names are not eligible to receive trademark protection. Also, trademark protection may not be available, or sought by us, in every country in which our technology and products are available online. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, or purchase our trademarks and confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to client confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term ReachLocal or our other trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our patent rights, trade secrets and domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our operating results.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nCompanies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently litigate or threaten litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Other parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. These types of litigations may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore our own issued and pending patents, if any, may provide little or no deterrence. In addition, we have been and could in the future become involved in disputes over the use of keywords by our clients, to the extent such clients\u2019 competitors allege the use of such keywords on our technology platform violates such competitors\u2019 trademark rights. We cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights; cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Over time, we expect that we will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows or as our presence and visibility within the industry increases.\nWe could lose clients if we or our media partners fail to detect click-through or other fraud on advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to our clients.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks or actions on our third-party publishers\u2019 websites. We may lose clients, or in the future, we may have to refund revenue that our clients have paid to us and that was later attributed to, or suspected to be caused by, click-through fraud. Click-through fraud occurs when an individual clicks on an ad displayed on a website or an automated system is used to create such clicks with little to no intent of viewing the underlying content. If fraudulent clicks are not detected, the affected clients may become dissatisfied with our campaigns, which in turn may lead to loss of clients and the related revenue.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws and regulations could have a significant impact on online advertising services depending on how these laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced. It is also clear that the laws and regulations are intending to regulate behavioral targeting, the availability of which could become highly limited are eliminated entirely. Our product suite does not rely heavily on the use of behavioral targeting, but we do offer a display remarketing product, which involves showing a consumer an ad for the website of a client that the consumer has previously visited.\nIn addition, a number of proposals are pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. For example, a revision to the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive is currently being considered by European legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for data processors and significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that would impose new obligations in areas such as privacy, data protection and data breach notifications. Some of the proposed changes to U.S. and European law could require that we obtain prior consent before using cookies or other tracking technologies or provide a \u201cdo not track\u201d mechanism in certain circumstances.\nWe have in the past relied on adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of personally identifiable information by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. As a result of the October 6, 2015 European Union Court of Justice, or ECJ, opinion in the Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner case, the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Framework is no longer deemed to be a valid method of compliance with restrictions set forth in the Data Protection Directive (and member states\u2019 implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of data outside of the EEA. We are currently relying on other methods to our customers to enable compliant data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. and are monitoring further developments in this area.\nThese existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nWe process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store and process personal information and other user data, including credit card information for certain users. There are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or negative publicity and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties with whom we work, such as our publishers or our providers of telephony services, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our users\u2019 information at risk and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our services may utilize \u201copen source\u201d software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nSome of our services may utilize software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License. Some of those licenses may require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create using the open source software, that we provide notices with our products and that we license any modifications or derivative works under an open source license or rights of further use to third parties. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. Although we take steps to ensure that our software engineers properly isolate our proprietary software they design from open source software components, we may not control the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not inappropriately incorporated open source software into our proprietary technologies. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to obtain a judgment against us based on allegations that we had not complied with the terms of any applicable open source license, we could be subject to liability for copyright infringement damages and breach of contract. In addition, we could be enjoined from selling our services that contained the open source software and required to make the source code for the open source software available, to grant third parties certain rights of further use of our software or to remove the open source software from our services, which could disrupt our distribution and sale of some of our services.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet is evolving, and unfavorable changes could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth in use of the Internet and online services. The application of existing laws to the Internet and online services governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy has not yet been settled. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and operating results. Other laws and regulations that have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, that may affect our business include those covering user privacy, data protection, spyware, \u201cdo not email\u201d lists, access to high speed and broadband service, pricing, taxation, tariffs, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, export of encryption technology, electronic contracting, click-fraud, acceptable content, search terms, lead generation, behavioral targeting, consumer protection, and quality of products and services. Any changes in regulations or laws that hinder growth of the Internet generally or that decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications, commercial and advertising medium could adversely affect our business. See also Part 1, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\u201d\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nShares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 19, 2010 at a price of $13.00 per share, and our common stock has subsequently traded as high as $28.39 and as low as $0.55. In addition, at times during the past year, trading volumes have declined substantially as compared to earlier periods. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nour capital and liquidity position and ability to access additional capital, if necessary;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our solutions;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the recent distress in the financial markets has also resulted in extreme volatility in security prices.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by stockholders could depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of March 23, 2016, approximately 55% of our common stock is held by our directors, officers and entities affiliated with our directors, including approximately 43% beneficially owned by VantagePoint Capital Partners (including approximately 450,000 shares issuable upon conversion of the VantagePoint Notes) and approximately 9% beneficially owned by Rho Ventures. Such shares have not been subject to lock-up agreements since November 2010. VantagePoint and Rho Ventures were our two primary venture capital investors and have owned their shares for a considerable length of time. If either VantagePoint or Rho Ventures decides to exit its investment in us, it could negatively impact the price of our common stock. During February and March of 2014, Rho Ventures sold an aggregate of approximately 187,000 shares of our common stock.\nIf there are substantial sales of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 6.9 million shares subject to outstanding options and RSUs under our 2004 Stock Plan, our Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and inducement awards, are potentially eligible for sale in the public market in the future. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. The number of analysts covering our company has decreased from a maximum of nine to two currently and if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nIf we are unable to continue to comply with the NASDAQ Global Select Market\u2019s continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could have an adverse effect on the liquidity and market price of such shares.\nNASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements require, among other requirements, that we maintain at least $15 million of public float and that the minimum bid price of our common stock not fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Although as of March 23, 2016, we are in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, our public float fell below $15 million in December 2015 and our common stock has traded below $1.00 in the recent past. If we fail to meet either of these requirements, or others, for more than 30 consecutive trading days, we will have 180 days to satisfy such requirement for a period of at least 10 trading days. If we fail to regain compliance during such period, we could be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nIf we fail to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the market liquidity and market price of our common stock will be harmed. If the stock were to trade it would likely trade on the OTC \u201cpink sheets,\u201d which provide significantly less liquidity than does NASDAQ. As a result, the liquidity of our common stock would be impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold, but also through delays in the timing of transactions, reduction in security analysts\u2019 and news media\u2019s coverage, and lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be attained. In addition, our common stock would become subject to the low-priced security or so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities.\nInvestment funds managed by VantagePoint Capital Partners own a substantial amount of our stock and have significant influence over our business. In the aggregate, insiders own a majority of our outstanding stock.\nAs of March 23, 2016, VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of our early venture capital investors, beneficially owned approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock (including approximately 450,000 shares issuable upon conversion of the VantagePoint Notes). As a result, VantagePoint has significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. VantagePoint\u2019s significant ownership also could affect the market price of our common stock by, for example, delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Alan Salzman, the Chief Executive Officer of VantagePoint, serves as a member of our board of directors.\nAs of March 23, 2016, our current directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the president (in absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending the bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, our board of directors has approved the transaction.", "PERMNO": 93400, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RLOC"}
