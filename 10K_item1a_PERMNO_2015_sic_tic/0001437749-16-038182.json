RISK FACTORS\nStatements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere that are forward-looking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the Company\u2019s actual results of operations. Certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and, in the future, could affect the Company\u2019s actual results are discussed below. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made due to new information or future events. Investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the Company\u2019s business and any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere. Any of the following risks or others discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Company\u2019s other SEC filings could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions pose financial, management and other risks and challenges.\nThe Company routinely explores acquiring other businesses and assets. During fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Novus, ProteinSimple, and CyVek, and in fiscal 2016, we acquired Cliniqa Corporation and Zephyrus BioSciences. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, and availability of capital. When we do identify and consummate acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. There can be no assurance that the Company will engage in any additional acquisitions or that the Company will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits. In addition, acquisitions financed with borrowings could make the Company more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our amortizable intangible assets, including goodwill and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets (including goodwill or assets acquired via acquisitions) include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. We have recorded and may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to protect and maintain its intellectual property, including trade secrets. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. The Company attempts to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements, but those agreements can be breached, and if they are, there may not be an adequate remedy. If trade secrets become publicly known, the Company could lose its competitive position.\nThe Company also attempts to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process. As of June 30, 2016, we owned or exclusively licensed 76 granted U.S. patents and approximately 70 pending patent applications. We cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted. It is possible that, if patents are granted to us, others will design around our patented technologies. Further, other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable. We may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nWe may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact our business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate. The Company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others. Since the Company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products, it is possible that products of the Company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties.\nThe Company has been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that the Company is infringing their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits are expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s focus from other business concerns. If the Company is found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, it could be required to cease certain activities, alter its products or processes or pay licensing fees. This would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, it may be unable to sell some of its products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. In addition, if the Company does not prevail, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company has entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility. The burden of this additional debt could adversely affect the Company, make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent it from funding its expansion strategy.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Advanced Cell Diagnostics on August 1, 2016, the Company entered into a new revolving credit facility, governed by a Credit Agreement dated July 28, 2016. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $400 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. As of August 26, 2016, the Company had drawn $250 million under the Credit Agreement.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such as:\n\u25a0\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;\n\u25a0\nincreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and competitive conditions; and\n\u25a0\nincreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to increases in interest rates.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, the Company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. Our ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements. The implementation of the new ERP system requires the investment of significant financial and human resources. We completed the first phase of implementation in July of 2016. During this initial implementation, which covered most of our operations and accounting systems at our headquarters in Minneapolis, we experienced some disruption in our shipping and invoicing activities we believe will impact revenues in the short term. As we continue expanding the use of our new ERP system to additional locations, we may experience further difficulties. Any further disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting involving the effectiveness of the control environment and risk assessment, information, communication, and monitoring processes resulting in a lack of effective controls over general information technology controls (GITC) for certain applications. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause usto fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nThe Company is subject to risk associated with global operations.\nThe Company engages in business globally, with approximately 37% of the Company\u2019s sales revenue in fiscal 2016 coming from outside the U.S. This subjects the Company to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.\nThe application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in the Company\u2019s business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company incurs additional legal compliance costs associated with its global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S.\nThe Company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets, which may cause additional operational and legal risk.\nThe Company\u2019s efforts to grow its businesses depend, to a degree, on its success in developing market share in additional geographic markets including, but not limited to, China. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than the Company\u2019s other markets. For example, a recent incident involving a Chinese university student who died after seeking treatment for a rare form of cancer from a treatment center identified through an internet search has led to a government investigation and a temporary halt to certain cancer treatments until more comprehensive safety regulations can be implemented, leading to lower sales growth in certain products offered by the Company. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the Company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although the Company implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which the Company outsources certain aspects of its business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with the Company\u2019s internal policies. Any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by the Company\u2019s internal policies, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and result in significant fines or penalties.\nThe Company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates and changes to the strength of foreign governments and economic conditions.\nApproximately 23% of the Company\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2016 were made through its foreign subsidiaries, which transact their sales in foreign currencies. Any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could, therefore, negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. In June of 2016, Britain voted to exit the European Union. The uncertainty over the consequences of that decision has negatively impacted the value of the British pound and has led to some disruption in economic activity in the UK and in the Eurozone region. The Company maintains its European headquarters and shipping facilities in the UK. It is also unclear how and whether the British vote to depart the European Union will impact our ability to conduct business cost effectively from our UK headquarters. Moreover, the financial crisis faced by several Eurozone countries, and the ongoing economic instability in that region, may lead to reduced spending on health care and research by Eurozone governments, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s European sales, as well as its revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production, sales and marketing, and management personnel are critical to the Company\u2019s success. The Company\u2019s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. The Company also operates in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong, making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations. The Company\u2019s growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees. As the Company integrates acquisitions and evolves its corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces, some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing. The failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in economic conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions. Research and development spending by the Company\u2019s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The Company\u2019s clinical controls products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market, which relies largely on government healthcare-related policies and funding. Changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. The U.S. and global economies recently experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover. In Japan, government investment in biotechnology research remains weak. Such downturns, and other reductions or delays in governmental funding, could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the Company\u2019s products. The Company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings.\nThe industry segments in which we operate are very competitive, more so recently due to consolidation trends.\nThe Company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates. Competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers\u2019 needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational, and research and development resources than the Company. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on the Company. Moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. The entry into the market by manufacturers in China, India and other low-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors\u2019 actions may impact the Company\u2019s future sales and earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment.\nOne element of the Company\u2019s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases. As a result, the Company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs. New product development requires planning, designing and testing at both technological and manufacturing-process levels and may require significant research and development expenditures. There can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that the Company may seek to develop in the future, will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance. There can also be no assurance that the Company\u2019s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in a more timely and cost effective manner than the Company. If the Company does not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies, the Company\u2019s technologies will become outdated, rendering the Company\u2019s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. To the extent the company fails to introduce new and innovative products, the Company may lose market share to its competitors, which may be difficult or impossible to regain.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by various US federal, state and international agencies. Laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the Company\u2019s operations including design, development, manufacturing, labeling, selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders. Any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the Company\u2019s operations and ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of the Company\u2019s products. If the Company fails to comply with any of these regulations, it may become subject to fines, penalties or actions that could impact development, manufacturing and distribution and/or increase costs or reduce sales. The approval process applicable to clinical control products and certain immunoassay kits that may be developed by the Company may take a year or more. Delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the Company, and negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions. From time to time, new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments.\nThe Company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products.\nThe Company\u2019s internal quality control, packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the Company\u2019s sales. Since certain Company products must comply with Food and Drug Administration Quality System Regulations and because in all instances, the Company creates value for its customers through the development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason, particularly at the Minneapolis facility, could adversely affect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. While the Company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks, and while insurance coverage may reimburse, in whole or in part, for losses related to such disruptions, the Company\u2019s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions.\nThe design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls, litigation or alerts relating to the Company\u2019s products. A recall could result in significant costs and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation which could reduce demand, particularly for certain of its regulated products.\nDisruptions in the supply and cost of raw materials could reduce the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow, and ability to meet customers\u2019 needs.\nThe Company\u2019s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, some of the Company\u2019s products are available only from a single supplier. If such suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to supply these materials for any reason, such failures could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s product sales and business. In addition, price increases for raw materials could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nIncreased exposure to product liability claims could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nProduct liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products offered by the Company\u2019s customers. Currently these risks are primarily borne by the Company\u2019s customers. As the Company\u2019s products and services are further integrated into customers\u2019 production processes, the Company may become increasingly exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of its products or services is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. There can be no assurance that a future product liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company would not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business or the results of operations. The Company\u2019s business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of any insurance coverage that it may have. In addition, product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly, divert management\u2019s attention, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and demand for its products.\nAny such product liability claims brought against the Company could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage. Although the Company carries product liability insurance, it cannot be certain that current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe Company may incur losses as a result of its investments in ChemoCentryx, Inc. and other companies in which it does not have a majority interest, the success of which is largely out of the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company\u2019s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the Company\u2019s business. These strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected.\nThe Company has an approximate 14% equity investment in ChemoCentryx, Inc. (CCXI) that is valued at $28.6 million on the Company\u2019s June 30, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet. CCXI is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancers. The development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking. CCXI is dependent on a limited number of products, must achieve favorable clinical trial results, obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products. CCXI has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability.\nThe ownership of CCXI shares is very concentrated, the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares. These factors make it possible that the Company could experience future dilution or lose its original $29.5 million investment in CCXI. At August 26, 2016, the market value of the Company\u2019s investment in CCXI was approximately $31.8 million.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company\u2019s computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\nThe integrity and protection of the Company\u2019s own data, and that of its customers and employees, is critical to the Company\u2019s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to market its products and services to customers. Although the Company\u2019s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company\u2019s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business.\nWe are now subject to regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d which may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nWith our acquisitions of ProteinSimple and CyVek in fiscal 2015, we now manufacture and sell products that may be covered under the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) rule regarding \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d We are now required to determine whether these products contain conflict minerals, and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country. Under the regulations, we are required to file a report with the SEC by May 31, 2017, to disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country. Complying with this regulation could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.", "PERMNO": 75694, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TECH"}
