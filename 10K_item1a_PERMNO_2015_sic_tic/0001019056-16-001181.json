{"cik": "1163199", "company": "FNB BANCORP/CA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks associated with the business of banking generally, as described above under Item 1 (Description of Business), the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, future prospects and stock price can be adversely impacted by certain risk factors, as set forth below, any of which could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from the recent results or from the Company\u2019s anticipated future results.\nExtensive Regulation of Banking. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance in all material respects with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the conduct of its business. Because the Company\u2019s business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to it are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that these laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance much more difficult or expensive, restrict the Company\u2019s ability to originate, broker or sell loans, further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by the Company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or future prospects.\nGovernmental Fiscal and Monetary Policies. The business of banking is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Such policies are beyond the control of the Company. The Company is particularly affected by the policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in relation to the supply of money and credit in the United States, and the target federal funds rate.\nThe instruments of monetary policy available to the Board of Governors can be used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, and this can and does have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Federal monetary policy may also affect the longer-term inflation rate which directly affects the national and local economy.\nThe Effects of Legislation in Response to Credit Conditions. Legislation passed at the federal level and/or by the State of California in response to conditions affecting credit markets could cause the Company to experience higher credit losses if such legislation reduces the amount that borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts with the Bank. Such legislation could also result in the imposition of limitations upon the Bank\u2019s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or make foreclosure less economically feasible. Such events could result in increased loan losses and require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and thereby adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, profitability and stock price.\nGeographic Concentration. All of the banking offices of the Company are located in the Northern California Counties of San Mateo, Santa Clara and San Francisco. The Company and the Bank conduct business primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in this area. Our success depends upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets, and adverse economic conditions could reduce our growth rate, or affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally impact our financial condition and results of operations. Economic conditions in the State of California are subject to various uncertainties at this time, including the budgetary and fiscal difficulties facing the State government.\nCompetition. Increased competition in the market areas served by the Bank may result in reduced loans and deposits. Ultimately, the Bank may not be able to compete successfully against current and future bank and non-bank competitors.\nMany competitors offer the banking services that are offered by the Bank in its service area. These competitors include national and super-regional banks, finance companies, investment banking and brokerage firms, credit unions, government-assisted farm credit programs, other community banks and technology-oriented financial institutions offering online services. In particular, the Bank\u2019s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances, such as Internet-based banking services that cross traditional geographic bounds, enable more companies to provide financial services.\nThe Effects of Changes to FDIC Insurance Coverage Limits and Assessments. FDIC insurance assessments are uncertain and increased premiums may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures. In such event, the FDIC would take control of failed banks and guarantee payment of deposits up to applicable insured limits from the Deposit Insurance Fund. Insurance premium assessments to insured financial institutions may increase as necessary to maintain adequate funding of the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nDespite the increase in deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor, some depositors may reduce the amount of deposits held at the Bank if concerns regarding bank failures arise, which could affect the level and composition of the Bank\u2019s deposit portfolio and thereby directly impact the Bank\u2019s funding costs and net interest margin. The Bank\u2019s funding costs may also be adversely affected in the event that activities of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury to provide liquidity for the banking system and improvement in capital markets are curtailed or are unsuccessful. Such events could reduce liquidity in the markets, thereby increasing funding costs to the Bank or reducing the availability of funds to the Bank to finance its existing operations and thereby adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, profitability and stock price.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds.\nInterest rates are sensitive to many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Our portfolio of securities is subject to interest rate risk and will generally decline in value if market interest rates increase, and generally increase in value if market interest rates decline.\nTechnology and Technological Change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology will enable efficiency and meeting customers\u2019 changing needs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to retain and compete for customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact of the long-term aspect of our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nDependence on Key Officers and Employees. We are dependent on the successful recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel. Our ability to implement our business strategies is closely tied to the strengths of our executive officers who have extensive experience in the banking industry but who are not easily replaced.\nIn addition, business banking, one of the Company\u2019s principal lines of business, is dependent on relationship banking, in which the Bank personnel develop professional relationships with small business owners and officers of larger business customers who are responsible for the financial management of the companies they represent. If these employees were to leave the Bank and become employed by a local competing bank, we could potentially lose business customers. In addition, we rely on our customer service staff to effectively serve the needs of our consumer customers. We actively recruit for all open positions and management believes that its relations with employees are good.\nGrowth strategy. The Company continues to pursue a growth strategy which depends primarily on generating an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels. We may not be able to sustain our growth strategy without establishing new branches or developing new products. We may attempt to expand by opening new branch offices or acquiring other financial institutions or branch offices or through a purchase, in whole or in part, of other financial institutions. This expansion may require significant investments in equipment, technology, personnel and site locations. We cannot assure you of our success in implementing our growth strategy either through expansion of our existing branch system or through mergers and acquisitions, and there may be significant increases in our noninterest expenses, without any corresponding balance sheet growth. Mergers and acquisitions may not add to the growth of the Bank\u2019s loans, deposits or the Bank\u2019s profitability due to integration problems, collateral differences, changes in business conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances.\nCommercial loans. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 7% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans, which could have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans. Commercial lending is dependent on borrowers making payments on their loans and lines of credit in accordance with the terms of their notes. Worsening economic conditions could make it difficult for many commercial borrowers to make their required loan payments. This credit risk is increased when there is a concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the mobility of collateral, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. The availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.\nIn addition, unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business. If the Bank is required to repossess equipment or pursue collection efforts under personal guarantees, there could be a substantial decrease in value of collateral, if any, increased legal costs, and an increased risk of loss on the amount outstanding.\nReal Estate Values. A large portion of the loan portfolio of the Company is dependent on the performance of our real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2015, real estate (including construction loans) served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately 93% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio.\nA substantial decline in the economy in general, coupled with a continued decline in real estate values in the Company\u2019s primary operating market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, and the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans. Real estate values have declined, due in part to reduced construction lending, tighter underwriting requirements, and reduced borrower ability to make payments. Real estate loans may pose collection problems, resulting in increased collection expenses, and delays in the ultimate collection of these loans. In addition, acts of nature, including fires, earthquakes and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for inherent loan defaults and non-performance, but its allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses. In addition, future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect the Company and therefore the Company\u2019s operating results. The Company\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, and these losses current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company\u2019s loans and the allowance for loan and lease losses. Although we believe that the Company\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover inherent future losses, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan and lease losses or that the regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nOther Real Estate Owned (\u201cOREO\u201d). Real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures is expected to be sold and is recorded at its fair value less estimated costs to sell (fair value). The amount, if any, by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) are charged to the allowance for loan or lease losses, if necessary. The Company\u2019s earnings could be materially and adversely affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including legal expenses, personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments, and other expenses associated with property ownership. Also, any further decrease in market prices of real estate in our market areas may lead to additional OREO write downs, with a corresponding expense in our income statement. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our OREO totaled $1,026,000 and $763,000, respectively.\nEnvironmental Liabilities. In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigations or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we could become subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nDilution of Common Stock. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 4,541,680 were outstanding at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to its 1997, 2002 and 2008 Stock Option Plans, at December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding options to purchase a total of 465,414 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2015, 404,766 shares of common stock remained available for grants under the 2008 Stock Option Plan.\nThe issuance of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s newly issued common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The market for the Company\u2019s common stock is limited, making the ability to raise funds in the future through a stock offering more difficult.\nCybersecurity Losses. The Company is subject to certain operations risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system or cybersecurity failures and customer or employee fraud. The Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for such risks, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by the Company\u2019s internal controls, uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the Company is dependent on network and computer systems. If these systems and their back-up systems were to fail or were breached, the Company could be adversely affected. The company cannot be certain that the continued implementation of safeguards will eliminate the risk of vulnerability to technological difficulties or failures or ensure the absence of a breach of information or security, including as a result of a cybersecurity breach. The bank regulatory agencies have recently emphasized cybersecurity as a critical challenge facing the financial services industry in light of the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks. The Company and the Bank will continue to enhance their information security programs consistent with regulatory requirements, including reliance on the services of various vendors who provide data processing and communications services to the financial services industry. Nonetheless, if information security is compromised or other technology difficulties or failures occur at the Bank or with one of its vendors, information may be lost or misappropriared, services and operations may be interrupted and the Bank could be exposed to claims from its customers.\nBusiness Confidence Uncertainty. Terrorist activities in the future and the actions taken by the United States and its allies in combating terrorism on a worldwide basis could adversely impact the Company and the extent of such impact is uncertain. Even more so, the problems in the mortgage and credit markets, the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as large write-offs at some major financial institutions have had a negative impact on the entire financial services industry. Such events have had an adverse effect on the economy in the Company\u2019s market areas.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Risk. The failure of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of San Francisco or the national Federal Home Loan Bank System may have a material negative impact on our earnings and liquidity.\nEven though the FHLB of San Francisco has announced it does not anticipate that additional capital will be necessary, nor does it believe that its capital level is inadequate to support realized losses in the future, the FHLB of San Francisco could require its members, including the Bank, to contribute additional capital in order to return the FHLB of San Francisco to compliance with capital guidelines.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank held $5.2 million of common stock in the FHLB of San Francisco. Should the FHLB of San Francisco fail, we anticipate that our investment in the FHLB\u2019s common stock would be \u201cother than temporarily\u201d impaired and may have limited value.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Bank maintained a line of credit with the FHLB of San Francisco with a maximum borrowing capacity of $332,836,000, of which $317,377,000 was available. Advances under the line of credit are secured by a blanket collateral agreement, a pledge of our FHLB common stock and certain other qualifying collateral, such as commercial and mortgage loans. The Bank is highly dependent on the FHLB of San Francisco as the primary source of wholesale funding for immediate liquidity and borrowing needs. The failure of the FHLB of San Francisco or the FHLB system in general, may materially impair our ability to meet our growth plans or to meet short and long term liquidity demands.", "PERMNO": 16672, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNBG"}
