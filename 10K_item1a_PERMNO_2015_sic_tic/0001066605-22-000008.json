RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a material impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nCompany Risks\nOperational Risks\nWe depend on attracting, integrating, developing, managing, and retaining qualified consultants and senior leaders.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, integrate, manage and retain quality consultants with the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our clients\u2019 needs and achieve our operational and financial goals. Our ability to hire and retain qualified consultants could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, disparity in compensation relative to our competitors, modifications to our total compensation philosophy or competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire, develop and retain qualified consultants, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our future success also depends upon our ability to integrate newly hired consultants successfully into our operations and to manage the performance of our consultants. Failure to successfully integrate newly hired consultants or to manage the performance of our consultants could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income. There is also a risk that unanticipated turnover in senior leadership could stall company activity, interrupt strategic vision or lower productive output which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to prevent our consultants from taking our clients with them to another firm.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain strong, long-term relationships with our clients. Although we work on building these relationships between our firm and our clients, in many cases one or two consultants have primary responsibility for a client relationship. When a consultant leaves one executive search firm and joins another, clients who have established relationships with the departing consultant may move their business to the consultant\u2019s new employer. We may also lose clients if the departing consultant has widespread name recognition or a reputation as a specialist in executing searches in a specific industry or management function. If we fail to retain important client relationships when a consultant departs our firm, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain our professional reputation and brand name.\nWe depend on our overall professional reputation and brand name recognition to secure new engagements and hire qualified consultants. Our success also depends on the individual reputations of our consultants. We obtain many of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients. A client who is dissatisfied with our work can adversely affect our ability to secure new engagements. If any factor, including poor performance, hurts our reputation we may experience difficulties in competing successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants. Failure to maintain our professional reputation and brand name could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our clients may restrict us from recruiting their employees, we may be unable to fill or obtain new executive search assignments.\nClients frequently require us to refrain from recruiting certain of their employees when conducting executive searches on behalf of other clients. These restrictions generally remain in effect for no more than one year following the commencement of an engagement. However, the specific duration and scope of the off-limits arrangements depend on the length of the client relationship, the frequency with which the client engages us to perform searches, the number of assignments we have performed for the client and the potential for future business with the client.\nClient restrictions on recruiting their employees could hinder us from fulfilling executive searches. Additionally, if a prospective client believes that we are overly restricted from recruiting the employees of our existing clients, these prospective clients may not engage us to perform their executive searches. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe rely heavily on information management systems.\nOur success depends upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage substantial amounts of information. To achieve our goals, we must continue to improve and upgrade our information management systems. We may be unable to license, design and implement, in a cost-effective and timely manner, improved information systems that allow us to compete effectively. In addition, business process reengineering efforts may result in a change in software platforms and programs. Such efforts may result in an acceleration of depreciation expense over the shortened expected remaining life of the software and present transitional problems. Problems or issues with our proprietary search system or other factors may result in interruptions or loss in our information processing capabilities which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are investing in new technology and intellectual property for the introduction of new products and services to our clients. Our inability to successfully implement these new technologies, products and services could negatively affect our business and profitability.\nWe continue to invest in new technology and intellectual property to enhance the products and services we offer to penetrate new markets and increase our client base. The development of new technology and intellectual property is subject to a number of risks including customer acceptance and obsolescence. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and effective development and market acceptance, and can be negatively impacted by various factors such as quality issues or other deficiencies and the risk that our competitors beat us to market with similar or more well-regarded products and services. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully develop new technology and intellectual property and effectively manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. If our new products and services are not successfully implemented or received by our clients, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our professional reputation, could be adversely affected.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe face the risk of liability in the services we perform.\nWe are exposed to potential claims with respect to the executive search process. A client could assert a claim for violations of off-limits arrangements, breaches of confidentiality agreements or professional malpractice. The growth and development of our consulting services brings with it the potential for new types of claims. In addition, candidates and client employees could assert claims against us. Possible claims include failure to maintain the confidentiality of the candidate\u2019s employment search or for discrimination or other violations of the employment laws or malpractice. In various countries, we are subject to data protection laws impacting the processing of candidate information. We maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and coverage that we believe are adequate; however, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover all claims or that coverage will always be available. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nData security, data privacy and data protection laws, such as GDPR, and other evolving regulations and cross-border data transfer restrictions, may limit the use of our services and adversely affect our business.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. As a result, we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, which may require us to make changes to our approach to services, solutions and/or products so as to enable the Company and/or our clients to meet new legal requirements. Although we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business, ongoing efforts to comply with GDPR and other rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws in countries such as Brazil and China, or states in the U.S. such as California, may increase the complexity of our compliance operations, entail substantial expenses, and divert resources from other initiatives and projects. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could lead to more onerous obligations in our contracts, limiting our storage, transfer and processing of data and, in some cases, make it more difficult and costly to meet client expectations, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, due to the uncertainty and potentially conflicting interpretations of these laws, it is possible that such laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws or satisfactorily protect\npersonal information could result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, any of which could inhibit sales of our services, solutions and/or products in certain locations.\nThere may be adverse tax, legal, and other consequences if the independent contractor classification of our on-demand independent talent is challenged.\nWe consider the on-demand talent available through On-Demand Talent primarily as independent contractors. In general, any time a court or administrative agency determines that we or our clients have misclassified an on-demand consultant as an independent contractor, we or our clients could incur tax and other liabilities for failing to properly withhold or pay taxes on the consultant\u2019s compensation as well as potential wage and hour and other liabilities depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.\nWe may become subject to administrative inquiries and audits concerning the taxation and classification of our on-demand consultants. There is often uncertainty in the application of worker classification laws, and consequently there is risk to us and to clients that independent contractors could be deemed to be misclassified under applicable law. The tests governing whether a service provider is an independent contractor or an employee are typically highly fact sensitive and vary by governing law. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are also subject to change as well as to divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability.\nA misclassification determination, allegation, claim, or audit involving our on-demand consultants creates potential exposure for clients and for us, including but not limited to reputational harm and monetary exposure arising from or relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages, and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to minimum wage and overtime); claims for employee benefits, social security contributions, and workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance; claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws; claims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity; and other claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability. Such claims could result in monetary damages (including but not limited to wage-based damages or restitution, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, and punitive damages), interest, fines, penalties, costs, fees (including but not limited to attorneys\u2019 fees), criminal and other liability, assessment, injunctive relief, or settlement, all of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks could pose a risk to our systems, networks, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Furthermore, the Company's remote work arrangements may make it more vulnerable to targeted activity from cybercriminals and may increase the risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches. We have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and client-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, lost data, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action which could result in a negative impact to our results of operations.\nIndustry and General Economic Risks\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, has and could continue to adversely impact or cause disruption to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy, may further disrupt financial markets and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues.\nCOVID-19 has spread to almost every country around the globe, including the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\nWith infections reported throughout the world, certain governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, vaccine mandates, testing requirements, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of the pandemic. Additional, potentially more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future, including as a result of resurgences of COVID-19 through variant strains. We temporarily closed our offices and shifted our workforce to remote operations to ensure the safety of our employees. In addition, certain of our customers have closed or reduced their operations during this pandemic.\nThe global pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Beginning in the 2020 second quarter, we experienced a decline in demand for our executive search and consulting services, a lengthening of the executive search process due to a slow-down in client decision making and an inability to execute in-person consulting engagements, which negatively impacted our results of operations. In 2021, our results of operations were not materially impacted by the pandemic, however, the extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic, and actions taken in response to the pandemic, on economic activity; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working remotely; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our clients\u2019 offices and facilities. Restrictions inhibiting our employees\u2019 and clients' ability to access those offices and facilities, has disrupted, and are expected to continue to disrupt, our ability to provide our services and solutions. These disruptions have, and may continue to, result in, among other things, a decline in demand for our executive search and consulting services due to temporary and permanent workforce reductions; a lengthening of the executive search process due to a slow-down in client decision making; an increase in executive searches placed on hold due to delays in planned work by our clients; an inability to execute in-person consulting engagements; prolonged disruptions in business operations for offices in areas most impacted by the pandemic, including the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, China and Brazil; terminations of client contracts and losses of revenue.\nManagement expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will continue to be impacted to some degree by the pandemic and actions taken in response to the pandemic, but the significance of the impact of the pandemic on our business and the duration for which it may have an impact will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to: the duration and severity of the pandemic; future resurgences and emergences of new variant strains of the COVID-19 virus; the impact of the pandemic, and actions taken in response to the pandemic, on economic activity; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; restrictions inhibiting our employees\u2019 ability to access our offices; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working remotely; and the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions. During the 2020 second quarter, the sustained economic downturn resulted in the impairment of the goodwill in our Europe and Asia Pacific reporting units. We also evaluated the recoverability of our intangible and other long-lived assets during the 2020 second quarter and determined that no impairment was necessary. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic for additional potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets. In 2021, we did not identify any triggering events for the impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a material effect on us. The ultimate effect that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations is not presently known to us or may present unanticipated risks that cannot be determined at this time.\nWe face aggressive competition.\nThe global executive search industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with other large global executive search firms, smaller specialty firms and, more recently with Internet-based firms and social media. Specialty firms may focus on regional or functional markets or on particular industries to a greater extent than we do. Some of our competitors may possess greater resources, greater name recognition and longer operating histories than we do in particular markets or practice areas, or be willing to reduce their fees or agree to alternative pricing practices in order to attract clients and increase market share. Our competitors may be further along in the development and design of technological solutions to meet client requirements.\nThere are limited barriers to entry into the search industry and new search firms continue to enter the market. Executive search firms that have a smaller client base than we do may be subject to fewer off-limits arrangements. In addition, our clients or prospective clients may decide to perform executive searches using in-house personnel. Also, as Internet-based firms continue to evolve, they may develop offerings similar to or more expansive than ours, thereby increasing competition for our services or more broadly disrupting the executive search industry. As a result, we may not be able to continue to compete\neffectively with existing or potential competitors and we may not be able to implement our leadership strategy effectively. Our inability to meet these competitive challenges could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net revenue and operating expenses may be affected by adverse economic conditions including inflation.\nDemand for our services is affected by global economic conditions and the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions in which we operate. During periods of slowed economic activity many companies hire fewer permanent employees, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If unfavorable changes in economic conditions occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Accelerated and pronounced economic pressures, such as the recent inflationary cost pressures, may negatively impact our expense base by increasing the costs we have to pay, including for services and employees.\nA significant currency fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.\nWith our operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, we conduct business using various currencies. In 2021, approximately 40% of our net revenue was generated outside the United States. As we typically transact business in the local currency of our subsidiaries, our profitability may be impacted by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to access additional credit could be limited.\nBanks can be expected to strictly enforce the terms of our credit agreement. Although we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility, a deterioration of economic conditions may negatively impact our business resulting in our failure to comply with these covenants, which could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility or from other borrowing facilities in the future. In such circumstances, we may not be able to secure alternative financing or may only be able to do so at significantly higher costs.\nGeneral Risks\nOur multinational operations may be adversely affected by social, political, regulatory, legal and economic risks.\nWe generate substantial revenue outside the United States. We offer our services through a network of offices in 26 countries around the world. Our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations, maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure, among other things, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations. We are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political, legal and economic conditions inherent in our operations, which could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we conduct business in countries where the legal systems, local laws and trade practices are unsettled and evolving. Commercial laws in these countries are sometimes vague, arbitrary and inconsistently applied. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for us to determine at all times the exact requirements of such local laws. If we fail to comply with local laws, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In addition, the global nature of our operations poses challenges to our management, and financial and accounting systems. Failure to meet these challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe recent military incursion by Russia into Ukraine could adversely impact macroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability and result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S. and the international community in a manner that adversely affects our operations in Russia and the broader region, including to the extent that any such sanctions restrict our ability to conduct business and/or to utilize the banking system. Although our operations in Russia represent an immaterial amount of our total revenue in 2021, further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, including Europe and Asia Pacific, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, or changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient profits to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets.\nWe establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is insufficient evidence that we will be able to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets. We reassess our ability to realize deferred tax assets as facts and circumstances dictate. If after future assessments of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets we determine that a lesser or greater allowance is required, we record a reduction or increase to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination. The uncertainty surrounding the future realization of our net deferred tax assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to align our cost structure with net revenue.\nWe must ensure that our costs and workforce continue to be in proportion to demand for our services. Failure to align our cost structure, including potential cost increases due to inflationary pressures, and headcount with net revenue could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we perform assessments of the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually, and we review our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. These events and circumstances include a significant change in business climate, attrition of key personnel, changes in financial condition or results of operations, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, competition, and other factors. In performing these assessments, we must make assumptions regarding the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. These assumptions include estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, discount rates, and other variables. If the fair market value of one of our reporting units or other long-term assets is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, we would be required to record an impairment charge. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to execute and integrate future acquisitions, if any, could negatively affect our business and profitability.\nOur future success may depend in part on our ability to complete the integration of acquisition targets successfully into our operations, including our recent acquisition of BTG. The process of executing and integrating an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of management attention;\n\u2022failure to successfully further develop the acquired business;\n\u2022amortization of intangible assets, adversely affecting our reported results of operations;\n\u2022inability to retain and/or integrate the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022inability to properly integrate businesses resulting in operating inefficiencies;\n\u2022inability to establish uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and other systems, procedures and policies in a timely manner;\n\u2022inability to retain the acquired company\u2019s clients;\n\u2022exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition; and\n\u2022inability to generate revenues to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with an acquired business.\nIf our acquisitions are not successfully executed and integrated, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our professional reputation, could be adversely affected.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions that make an acquisition of us difficult and expensive.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and the Delaware laws make it difficult and expensive for someone to acquire us in a transaction which is not approved by our Board of Directors. Some of the provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include:\n\u2022limitations on stockholder actions; and\n\u2022the ability to issue one or more series of preferred stock by action of our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions could discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium over the then-current market price for the common stock.", "PERMNO": 86827, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "HSII"}
