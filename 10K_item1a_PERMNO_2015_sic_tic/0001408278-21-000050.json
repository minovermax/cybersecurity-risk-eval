{"cik": "1408278", "company": "Synacor, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, including the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with any other documents we file with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact Synacor's operations\nThe spread of the COVID-19 throughout the world has also created global economic uncertainty and reduced optimism about the nearer term economic outlook, which has caused our partners, service providers and current or potential customers to closely monitor their costs, reduce their spending budgets and, in some cases, delay payments to us. Although Synacor does not sell directly to consumers, certain of Synacor\u2019s advertising revenue included in our Portal & Advertising segment relates to businesses and industries that have been temporarily shut down or otherwise negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Synacor is continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business closely. Beginning in March 2020, sharp declines in advertising expenditures as result of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a decline in revenue and lower margins in our Portal & Advertising segment. This reduction in revenue and lower margins in our Portal & Advertising segment continued into the third quarter of 2020, with recovery beginning in the 2nd half of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2020. Although we have seen recovery in the past two quarters, there is not guarantee that this will continue in future periods. In addition, while there has been relatively minimal impact on our Software & Services segment thus far, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact this business segment during future periods.\nIn addition, as a result of the pandemic, Synacor has implemented a work from home policy for all of its employees other than a small portion of its personnel who provide on-site technical support to Synacor\u2019s customers. Being in an industry where telecommuting is very common, Synacor has generally been able to perform all normal business activities with minimal impact on productivity. However, Synacor\u2019s work from home policy and travel restrictions have adversely impacted our sales and marketing staff who provide international and regional support. The potential further need to limit our operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beyond Synacor's announced restructuring plan may further reduce productivity or make developing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships more difficult.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts Synacor\u2019s results in future periods will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result, Synacor\u2019s sales cycle, revenues, profitability, cash flows and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected.\nA loss of any significant Portal and Advertising customer could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our efforts to provide a compelling consumer experience that increases consumer engagement with our Managed Portals. We have made and will continue to make investments in features and functionality for our technology that are designed to drive consumer engagement. If the expenses that we incur in connection with these activities do not result in increased consumer engagement that in turn results in revenue increases that exceed these expenses, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have diversified our product portfolio and our customer base, we continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of Managed Portal customers. For 2019, revenue attributable to one customer exceeded 10% of our total revenue, and accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue. For 2020, no customer had revenue that exceeded 10% of our total revenue, however, our top two customers accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue.\nOur contracts with our Managed Portals and Advertising customers generally have an initial term of approximately two to three years from the launch of their Managed Portals and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. If a key contract is not renewed or is otherwise terminated, or if revenue from a significant customer declines because of competitive or other reasons, including the customer\u2019s desire to reprioritize or deemphasize monetization of the portal, our revenue would decline and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be impaired. In addition to the loss of recurring and fee-based revenue, we would also lose significant revenue from the related search and digital advertising services that we provide. In addition to the decline of revenue, we may have to impair our long-lived assets, to the extent that such assets are used exclusively to support these customers, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nOur search advertising partner, Google, accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, and any loss of, or diminution in, our business relationship with Google would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on traffic on our Managed Portals to generate search and digital advertising revenue, a substantial portion of which is derived from text-based links to advertisers\u2019 websites as a result of internet searches. We have a revenue-sharing relationship with Google under which we include a Google-branded search tool on our Managed Portals. When a consumer makes a search request using this tool, we deliver it to Google, and Google returns search results to us that include advertiser-sponsored links. If the consumer clicks on a sponsored link, Google receives payment from the sponsor of that link and shares a portion of that payment with us. We then typically share a portion of that payment with the applicable customer. Google may terminate our agreement if we experience a change in control, if we enter into an agreement providing for a change in control, if we do not maintain certain search and digital advertising revenue levels or if we fail to conform to Google\u2019s search and advertising policies. Google may from time to time change its existing, or establish new, methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality of internet traffic. Any changes in these methodologies, metrics and advertising technology platforms could decrease the advertising rates that we receive and/or the amount of revenue that we generate from digital advertisements. If advertisers were to discontinue their advertising via internet searches, if Google\u2019s revenue from search-based advertising were to decrease, if Google\u2019s share of the search revenue were to increase or if our agreement with Google were to be terminated for any reason or renewed on less favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, consumers\u2019 increased use of search tools other than the Google-branded search tool we provide would have similar effects.\nOur Managed Portals solutions has suffered a loss of users, which may adversely affect our Portal business.\nThe number of active portal users has declined consistently for several years, and may further contract in the future. While we work with our customers to have their consumers\u2019 homepages set to our Managed Portals, a consumer may easily change that setting, which would likely decrease the use of our Managed Portals. Similarly, consumers who change their device\u2019s operating system, or internet browser, or acquire new consumer electronics devices may no longer have our Managed Portals set as their default homepage, and unless they change it back to our Managed Portals, their usage of our Managed Portals would likely decline and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the number of people who access the internet through devices other than PCs, including tablets, smartphones and connected TVs, has increased dramatically and is projected to continue to increase. Individuals are increasingly accessing the internet through apps other than internet browsers. Our Managed Portals include our responsive desktop and mobile web products and also our mobile native iOS and Android apps. If consumers do not use our mobile products at all or use these products less frequently than previously, our financial results could be negatively affected. Additionally, as new devices and new apps are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing new versions of our apps and other solutions for use on these alternative devices and apps, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such apps and solutions. If users of these devices and apps do not widely adopt the apps and other solutions we develop, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nConsumer tastes continually change and are unpredictable, and sales of our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions may decline if we fail to enhance our service and content offerings to achieve continued consumer acceptance.\nOur business depends on aggregating and providing services and content that our customers will place on our Managed Portals, including television programming, news, entertainment, sports and other content that their consumers find engaging, and premium services and paid content that their consumers will buy. Accordingly, we must continue to invest resources in licensing efforts, research and development and marketing to enhance our service and content offerings, and we must make decisions about these matters well in advance of product releases to implement them in a timely manner. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing content providers and websites and the availability of other news, entertainment, sports and other services and content.\nIf our services are not responsive to the requirements of our customers or the preferences of their consumers, or the services are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Even if our services and content are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a subsequent shift in the preferences of our customers or their consumers could cause a decline in the popularity of our services and content that could reduce our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for content that is critical to our business, and our business could suffer if we do not continue to obtain high-quality content at a reasonable cost.\nWe license the content that we aggregate on our Managed Portals from numerous third-party content providers, and our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain and enter into new relationships with these and other content providers. In some cases, we are required under our contracts, to provide our customers\u2019 consumers access to certain types of content. In the future, some of our content providers may not give us access to high-quality content, may fail to adapt to changes in consumer tastes or may increase the royalties, fees or percentages that they charge us for their content, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Our rights to the content that we offer to our customers and their consumers are not exclusive, and the content providers could license their content to our competitors. Our content providers could even grant our competitors exclusive licenses. In addition, our customers are not prohibited from entering into content deals directly with our content providers. Any failure to enter into or maintain satisfactory arrangements with content providers would adversely affect our ability to provide a variety of attractive services and products to our customers. Our reputation and operating results could suffer as a result, and it may be more difficult for us to develop new relationships with potential customers.\nMany of our customers are high-speed internet service providers, and consolidation within the cable and telecommunications industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant revenue from high-speed internet service and communications providers, including our search and digital advertising revenue generated by online consumer traffic on our Managed Portals. The cable and telecommunications industries have experienced consolidation over the past several years, and we expect that this trend will continue. As a result of consolidation, some of our customers may be acquired by companies with which we do not have existing relationships and which may have relationships with one of our competitors or may have the in-house capability to perform the services we provide. As a result, such acquisitions could cause us to lose customers and the associated revenue. Under our agreements with some of our customers, they may have the right to terminate the agreement if we are acquired by one of their competitors.\nWe may not maintain acceptable website performance for our Managed Portals and Advertising customers, which may negatively impact our relationships with our customers and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA key element to our continued growth is the ability of our customers\u2019 consumers in all geographies to access our Managed Portals and other offerings within acceptable load times. We refer to this as website performance. We may in the future experience platform disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our technology simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks.\nIn some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve website performance, especially during peak usage times, and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. If our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions are unavailable when consumers attempt to access them or do not load as quickly as they expect, consumers may seek other alternatives to obtain the information for which they are looking, and may not use our products and services as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our relationships with our customers. We expect to continue to make investments to maintain and improve website performance. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur sales cycles and the contracting process with new customers are long and unpredictable and may require us to incur expenses before executing a customer agreement, which makes it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate additional revenue and cash flows from those customers.\nWe market our services and products directly to high-speed internet service and communications providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and directly and indirectly to enterprises, and governmental and nonprofit organizations. New customer relationships typically take time to obtain and finalize because of the burdensome cost of migrating from an existing solution to our platform. Due to operating procedures in many organizations, a significant time period may pass between selection of our services and products by key decision-makers and the signing of a contract. The length of time between the initial customer sales call and the realization of significant sales is difficult to predict and can range from several months to several years. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and when we will begin to generate revenue and cash flows from these potential new customers.\nAs part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses in the form of compensation and related expenses and equipment acquisition before executing a definitive agreement with a prospective customer so that we may be ready to launch shortly following execution of a definitive agreement. If conditions in the marketplace or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive agreement will be executed, and we will be unable to recover any expenses incurred before a definitive agreement is executed, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely, to a significant degree, on indirect sales channels for the distribution of our Software products, and disruption within these channels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe use a variety of indirect distribution methods for our offerings, including channel partners, such as cloud service providers, distributors, and value added resellers. A number of these partners in turn distribute our offerings via their own networks of channel partners with whom we have no direct relationship. These relationships allow us to offer our technologies to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able through our direct sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our channel partners or a partner in its distribution network violate applicable law or regulatory requirements or misrepresent the functionality of our offerings, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to potential liability. Furthermore, our channel partners may offer their own products and services that are competitive with our offerings or may not distribute and market our offerings effectively. Our existing channel partner relationships do not, and any future channel partner relationships may not, afford us exclusive marketing or distribution rights. In addition, if a channel partner is acquired by a competitor or its business units are reorganized or divested, our revenue derived from that partner may be adversely impacted.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technologies requires significant time and resources. If we fail to devote sufficient resources to support and expand our network of channel partners, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, because we rely on channel partners for the indirect distribution of our technologies, we may have little or no contact with the ultimate end-users of our technologies, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our software, support ongoing customer requirements, estimate end-user demand, respond to evolving customer needs and obtain renewals from end-users. If our indirect distribution channel is disrupted, we may be required to devote more resources to distribute our offerings directly and support our customers, which may not be as effective and could lead to higher costs, reduced revenue and growth that is slower than expected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020 our cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $54.7 million. A failure to achieve or maintain profitability may adversely affect our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of our pre-tax cumulative losses, we have established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset, which includes our net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited.\nOur services and products may become less competitive or even obsolete if we fail to respond to technological developments.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to modify or enhance our services and products to meet customer and consumer needs, to add functionality and to address technological advancements that would improve their performance. For example, if our smartphone and tablet products fail to capture the increased search activity on such devices or if our services and products do not adapt to the increasing video usage on the internet or to take into account evolving developments in social networking, then they could begin to appear obsolete. Similarly, if we fail to develop new ways to deliver content and services through apps other than traditional internet browsers, consumers could seek alternative means of accessing content and services.\nTo remain competitive, we will need to develop new services and products and adapt our existing ones to address these and other evolving technologies and standards. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying new opportunities or in developing or marketing new services and products in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, our product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price levels necessary for profitability. If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing services and products or if we are unable to develop new services and products that keep pace with rapid technological developments or changing industry standards, our services and products may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive, and our business will be harmed.\nOur Zimbra Email/Collaboration solution was developed as an open-source software product. As such, it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of which may have greater resources than we have, to compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone may modify and redistribute the existing open source software and use it to compete with us. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. In addition, some of these competitors may make their open source software available for free download and use on an ad hoc basis or may position their open source software as a loss leader. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure and/or the availability of open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nAs a result of the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete, our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to the various factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nInternational operations are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from, and have operations, outside of the United States. Revenue from customers outside of the United States was 30% of total revenue in 2020. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings internationally, particularly in Asia, Canada, Latin America and Europe.\nAs the international markets in which we operate continue to grow, we expect that competition in these markets will intensify. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local markets. Some of our domestic competitors who have substantially greater resources than we do may be able to more quickly and comprehensively develop and grow in international markets. International expansion may also require significant financial investment including, among other things, the expense of developing localized products, the costs of acquiring foreign companies and the integration of such companies with our operations, expenditure of resources in developing customer and content relationships and the increased costs of supporting remote operations.\nOther risks of doing business in international markets include the increased risks and burdens of complying with different legal and regulatory standards, difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations, recruiting and retaining talented direct sales personnel, limitations on the repatriation of funds and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates, varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure and our ability to enforce contracts and our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur agreements with some of our customers contain penalties for non-performance, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have entered into service level agreements with many of our customers. These agreements generally call for specific system \u201cup times\u201d and 24 hours per day, seven days per week support and include penalties for non-performance. We may be unable to fulfill these commitments due to circumstances beyond our control, which could subject us to substantial penalties under those agreements, harm our reputation and result in a reduction of revenue or the loss of customers, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our agreements with customers contain penalties for certain types of non-performance which, if not timely rectified, could result in substantial financial penalties to us.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models, subject us to additional expenses and expose us to increased liability.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business.\nGlobally, new and emerging laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in Europe, state laws in the U.S. on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), potential U.S. federal legislation regarding consumer privacy, as well as industry self-regulatory codes create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. For example, the CCPA may precipitate additional privacy regulation by federal, state and local governments, which may increase our compliance costs and strain our technical capabilities, and such regulations may conflict with each other making it impossible to comply with all such regulations. Ensuring compliance with such laws is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our business practices fail to comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy regulations, our privacy policies or other related obligations (including in our agreements with customers), or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other subscriber data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, loss of access to data transfer mechanisms, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, or, terminate their agreements with us, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nSystem failures, security breaches, computer viruses or capacity constraints could harm our business and financial performance.\nThe provision of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Such interruptions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer malware, computer hacking attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruptions if the operators of the facilities have financial difficulties. Although we maintain insurance to cover a variety of risks, the scope and amount of our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions to our online operations. Any system failure or disruption and any resulting losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot all of our data centers are on full second-site redundancy, only certain customers require this capability. We regularly back-up our systems and store the system back-ups. If we were forced to relocate to an alternate site and to rely on our system back-ups to restore the systems, we could experience significant delays in restoring the functionality of our platform and could experience loss of data, which could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to expand our business, and the loss of key officers or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, finance, marketing and creative personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, marketing and media companies, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we were to be unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business could suffer.\nVolatility or lack of performance in the trading price of our common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become, or will become, vested in Company stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their options have significantly declined in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the trading price of our common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nThe protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on copyright and service mark enforcement, contractual restrictions and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with certain parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure and distribution of our proprietary information. Additionally, we have applied for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property. We have registered several marks and filed many other trademark applications in the United States and internationally. We have not applied for copyright protection in any jurisdiction including in the United States. However, if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization, and, our business may suffer from the piracy of our technology and the associated loss in revenue.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be costly and divert management resources, either of which could harm our business. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings with respect to protecting our intellectual property; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings with respect to protecting our intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nAny claims from a third party that we are infringing upon its intellectual property, whether valid or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses or force us to curtail some services or products.\nCompanies in the internet and technology industries tend to own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have been subject to claims that the presentation of certain licensed content on our Managed Portals infringes certain patents of various third parties, none of which have resulted in material direct settlement or payments by us or any determination of infringement by us, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of further intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services and products to others and may require that we procure substitute products or services for our customers.\nIn the case of any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for the infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these consequences could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, we typically have contractual obligations to our customers to indemnify and defend them with respect to third-party intellectual property infringement claims that arise from our customers\u2019 use of our products or services. Such claims, whether valid or not, could harm our relationships with our customers, could result in us or our customers having to enter into licenses with the claimants and could cause us to incur additional costs or experience reduced revenue. Such claims could also subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation as well as diverting management attention and resources. Satisfying our contractual indemnification obligations could also give rise to significant liability, and thus harm our business and our operating results.\nWe are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings with respect to third party claims that we or our customers\u2019 use of our products and services are infringing upon their intellectual property; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings with respect to such claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nAny unauthorized disclosure or theft of personal information we gather could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation.\nWe collect, and have access to, personal information of subscribers, including names, addresses, account numbers, credit card numbers and email addresses. There are numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and guidelines around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, destruction and security of personal information and other subscriber data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. Ensuring compliance with such laws is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our business practices fail to comply.\nUnauthorized disclosure of such personal information, whether through breach of our systems by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information we possess, our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by subscribers or our customers. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe growth of the market for our services and products depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure.\nOur business strategy depends on continued internet and high-speed internet access growth. Any downturn in the use or growth rate of the internet or high-speed internet access would be detrimental to our business. If the internet continues to experience significant growth in number of users, frequency of use and amount of data transmitted, the internet infrastructure might not be able to support the demands placed on it and the performance or reliability of the internet may be adversely affected. The success of our business therefore depends on the development and maintenance of a sound internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, such as routers, for providing reliable internet access and services. Consequently, as internet usage increases, the growth of the market for our products depends upon improvements made to the internet as well as to individual customers\u2019 networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion. In addition, any delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to govern increased levels of internet activity or increased governmental regulation may have a detrimental effect on the internet infrastructure.\nThe market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete effectively, our sales may decline and our business may be harmed.\nCompetition in the market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies and customer and subscriber requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. Our competitors may develop solutions that are similar or superior to our technology. Our primary competitors include high-speed internet service providers with internal information technology staff capable of developing solutions similar to our technology. Other competitors include: Google; Verizon Media; and MSN, a division of Microsoft. Advantages some of our existing and potential competitors hold over us include the following:\n\u2022significantly greater revenue and financial resources;\n\u2022stronger brand and consumer recognition;\n\u2022the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of services and products;\n\u2022ability to offer their products at significantly lower prices or at no cost;\n\u2022more extensive proprietary intellectual property from which they can develop or aggregate content without having to pay fees or paying significantly lower fees than we do;\n\u2022pre-existing relationships with content providers that afford them access to content while blocking the access of competitors to that same content;\n\u2022pre-existing relationships with high-speed internet service providers that afford them the opportunity to convert such providers to competing services and products;\n\u2022lower labor and development costs; and\n\u2022broader global distribution and presence.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the internet continues to evolve, and new laws and regulations could significantly harm our financial performance.\nOver time, we expect state, federal and international legislative bodies to continue to enact more stringent laws and regulations relating to the internet. The adoption or modification of laws related to the internet could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, increasing our costs and administrative burden.\nDue to the increasing popularity and use of the internet, many laws and regulations relating to the internet are being debated at the international, federal and state levels, which are likely to address a variety of issues such as:\n\u2022user privacy and expression;\n\u2022ability to collect and/or share necessary information that allows us to conduct business on the internet;\n\u2022export compliance;\n\u2022pricing and taxation;\n\u2022fraud;\n\u2022advertising;\n\u2022intellectual property rights;\n\u2022consumer protection;\n\u2022protection of minors;\n\u2022content regulation;\n\u2022information security; and\n\u2022quality of services and products.\nSeveral federal laws that could have an impact on our business have been adopted. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 reduces the liability of online service providers of third-party content, including content that may infringe copyrights or rights of others, but requires strict compliance with certain provisions to qualify for the safe harbor provisions; the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors under the age of 13; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.\nIt could be costly for us to comply with existing and potential laws and regulations, and they could harm our marketing efforts and our attractiveness to advertisers by, among other things, restricting our ability to collect demographic and personal information from consumers or to use or disclose that information in certain ways. If we were to violate these laws or regulations, or if it were alleged that we had, we could face private lawsuits, fines, penalties and injunctions and our business could be harmed.\nFinally, the applicability to the internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could also increase our costs of doing business, discourage internet communications, reduce demand for our services and expose us to substantial liability.\nRisks Related to the Offer and Merger\nWhether or not the Offer and Merger are completed, the announcement and pendency of the Offer and Merger could impact or cause disruptions in our businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and operating results.\nWhether or not the Offer and Merger are completed, the announcement and pendency of the Offer and Merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact our businesses and operating results. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees, and customers, channel partners, vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships us, or delay or defer decisions concerning our products or services or seek alternatives to the products or services offered by us. These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Offer and Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, operating results or prospects if the Offer and Merger are not completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completing the Offer and Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, or otherwise pursue actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would be beneficial to us. Additionally, the attention of our management may be directed toward completion of the Offer and Merger and transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to our businesses, which could negatively affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nFailure to complete the Offer and Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock as well as adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nCompletion of the Offer and Merger is subject to several conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way. The Offer and Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or, even if satisfied, that no event of termination will take place. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Offer and Merger will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.\nIf the Offer and Merger are not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline from current market prices. The failure to complete the Offer and Merger also may result in negative publicity and negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees, collaborators, customers, regulators and other business partners. In the event that the Offer and Merger are not completed for any reason, the holders of our common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the Offer and Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and the holders of our common stock will continue to own their shares of our common stock. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the Offer and Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nAdditionally, we have incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed Offer and Merger, even if the Offer and Merger are not completed. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated or the proposed Offer and Merger are not completed, these Offer and Merger related costs may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of the Merger Agreement may deter alternative business combinations and could deter a potential competing acquirer that may be willing to pay more to effect an alternative transaction with us.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are generally not permitted to solicit or discuss takeover proposals with third parties, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement also provides for the payment by us of a termination fee of $3.5 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances in connection with a competing third party acquisition proposal for the Company. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our stockholders and may discourage a third party from pursuing an acquisition proposal. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we cannot assure our stockholders we will be able to negotiate a transaction with another acquiror on terms comparable to the terms of the Offer and Merger, or that we will avoid the termination fee associated with the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, the target of lawsuits related to the Offer and Merger, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Offer and Merger from being completed.\nLawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements, such as has occurred for the Company with respect to the Offer and Merger. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Offer and Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Offer and Merger from being completed, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership among our directors and officers and their respective affiliates could limit our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key corporate decisions, such as an acquisition of our company.\nOur directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates, beneficially own or directly or indirectly control (including by voting proxy), as of March 26, 2021, approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock (including exercisable options). These stockholders, if they were to act together, would have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, if they act together, would have the ability to influence significantly the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the trading price of our common stock by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\n\u2022preventing the election of directors who are nominated by our stockholders; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of stockholders or others.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party will not make an unsolicited takeover proposal in the future or take other action to acquire control of us or to otherwise influence our management and policies. Considering and responding to any future proposal is likely to result in significant additional costs to us, and future acquisition proposals, other stockholder actions to acquire control and the litigation that often accompanies them, if any, are likely to be costly and time-consuming and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan.\nAdditionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors, may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce their reliance on the services we provide or decide to do business with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts, including:\n\u2022our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022our directors may only be removed for cause, and only with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;\n\u2022only our board of directors and not our stockholders will be able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022only our chairman of the board, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors, and not our stockholders, are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders will be able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions and other provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in our control. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction could cause stockholders to lose a substantial premium over the then-current trading price of their shares. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions such stockholders desire.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in February 2012 at a price of $5.00 per share through the close of business on March 31, 2021, our trading price has ranged from $0.79 to $18.00. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to the various factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as:\n\u2022variations in our financial performance;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new services and products, strategic alliances, asset acquisitions, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022announcements of acquisitions of, or mergers with companies\n\u2022announcements regarding our existing customer contracts;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022adoption or modification of laws, regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business or announcements relating to these matters.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class actions filed against them. Such a suit filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention.", "PERMNO": 13280, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SYNC"}
