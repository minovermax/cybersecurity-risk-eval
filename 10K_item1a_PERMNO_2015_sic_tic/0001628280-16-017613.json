RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nDeterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nVolatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:\n\u2022\nconsumers may shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely affecting the results of our Consumer Foods operations;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual and fine dining, which may adversely affect our Commercial Foods operations;\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our result of operations;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension contributions; and\n\u2022\nit may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us.\nOur existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nAs of May 29, 2016, we had a substantial amount of debt. We have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt. Our level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.\nAdditionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable. Any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt.\nWe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan, or SCAE Plan.\nDuring fiscal 2014, we announced our Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan, or SCAE Plan, which was an expansion of the scope of the plan to integrate Ralcorp. The SCAE Plan includes steps to optimize the entire organization\u2019s supply chain network and to improve selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies. Although the divestiture of the Private Brands business was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we will continue to implement portions of the SCAE Plan, including work related to optimizing our supply chain network and pursue cost reductions through our selling, general and administrative functions and productivity improvements. The successful design and implementation of the SCAE Plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers, business partners, and other stakeholders. In addition, the SCAE Plan may not advance our business strategy as expected. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the SCAE Plan, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the SCAE Plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the complexity of the SCAE Plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the SCAE Plan. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization\u2019s attention from existing core businesses, integrating financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIncreases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits.\nWe use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume, reduced margins, and profitability. We have experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (wheat, corn, and oats), oils, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until\nwe utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\nIncreased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.\nThe food industry is highly competitive, and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition. Our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. We sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients. Our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nChanges in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us.\nDuring fiscal 2016, our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenues. There can be no assurance that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, government action, or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.\nOur customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. These consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.\nIf we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, our profitability could decrease.\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile input costs. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. We have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\nAdditionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other national, state, and local government agencies. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the Food Safety Modernization Act and their respective regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, and safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent is required to be established. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. As previously disclosed, among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2016 related to the Company's 2007 peanut butter recall, was an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in Georgia and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice. We cooperated with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and the Department of Justice in regard to the investigation, and in May 2015, our subsidiary, ConAgra Grocery Products, entered into a plea agreement with the government, pursuant to which it agreed to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor under the Food, Drug & Cosmetics Act. The plea agreement is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.\nAny damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMaintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities; the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat; our research and development efforts; or our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials,\npackaging, energy use, and waste management. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.\nInflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties.\nOur facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. Our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, wheat, and potatoes. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber attacks, security problems, and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to\nbuild and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation risks, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information.\nThe inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about the Company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation. In addition, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges. Any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.\nAs of May 29, 2016, we had goodwill of $4.53 billion and other intangibles of $1.28 billion. The net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). The net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable), net of accumulated amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. Amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as the inability to quickly replace lost co-manufacturing business, increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.\nThe termination or expiration of current co-manufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur businesses periodically enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products. The terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time. Volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product's life cycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other factors, none of which are under our direct control. Our future ability to enter into co-manufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed, and a decrease in current co-manufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume.\nArdent Mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture.\nThe benefits that are expected to result from our Ardent Mills joint venture will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction, Ardent Mills' ability to successfully integrate the ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a going-forward basis. It is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all, and if we do, it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits. If, for example, we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings, or if there are unforeseen integration costs, or if Ardent Mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future, the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability.\nOur acquisition activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, effective\nand immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. Any of these factors could affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. We may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability.\nOur divestiture activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. Any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employee, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Proposed Spinoff of our Lamb Weston Business\nThe proposed spinoff of our Lamb Weston business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us if not completed.\nOn November 18, 2015, we announced plans to pursue the separation of ConAgra Foods, Inc. into two public companies: Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston. The transaction, expected to be structured as a spinoff of the Lamb Weston business to the shareholders of ConAgra Foods, Inc. in the fall of calendar 2016, is expected to be tax free to the Company and its shareholders. The proposed spinoff is subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions that could delay, prevent, or otherwise adversely affect the spinoff. Completion of the spinoff will be contingent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, authorization and approval of our board of directors,\nreceipt of governmental and regulatory approvals of the transactions contemplated by the spinoff, receipt of a tax opinion regarding the tax-free status of the spinoff, execution of intercompany agreements, and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the SEC. For these and other reasons, the spinoff may not be completed as expected during 2016, if at all.\nIn pursuing the proposed spinoff, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nexecution of the proposed spinoff will require significant time and attention from management, which may postpone the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\ncompletion of the spinoff will require strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations, which could lead to a disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and to complete the proposed spinoff;\n\u2022\ncompletion of the spinoff may require certain management and procedural redundancies as we prepare for the separation of the Lamb Weston business from Conagra Brands, which may result in operating inefficiencies; and\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the spinoff, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees, whether or not it is completed.\nIf the spinoff is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spinoff.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff.\nAlthough we believe that separating our Lamb Weston business from Conagra Brands will provide financial, operational, managerial, and other benefits to us and our stockholders, the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and we may not realize the intended benefits of the spinoff. In addition, we will incur one-time costs in connection with the spinoff that may exceed our estimates and negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve. If we do not realize these assumed benefits, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, if the proposed spinoff is completed, our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the Lamb Weston business from Conagra Brands. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility.\nIf the proposed spinoff of our Lamb Weston business is completed, the trading price of our common stock will decline.\nWe expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spinoff to be lower than immediately preceding the spinoff, as the trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our Lamb Weston business.\nFollowing the spinoff, the value of your common stock in: (a) the Company and (b) the Lamb Weston business may collectively trade at an aggregate price less than what the Company's common stock might trade at had the spinoff not occurred.\nThe common stock of: (a) the Company and (b) the Lamb Weston business that you may hold following the spinoff may collectively trade at a value less than the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock might have traded at had the spinoff not occurred. Reasons for this potential difference include the future performance of either the Company or the Lamb Weston business as separate, independent companies, and the future stockholder base and market for the Company\u2019s common stock and those of the Lamb Weston business and the prices at which these shares individually trade.\nThe spinoff could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe spinoff is conditioned on our receipt of an opinion from our tax advisors, in form and substance satisfactory to us, that the distribution of shares of our Lamb Weston business in the spinoff will qualify as tax-free to the Lamb Weston business, the Company, and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, and other members of our consolidated tax reporting group. The opinion will rely on, among other things, various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the Company and the Lamb Weston business which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such advisor in its opinion. The opinion will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code or that any such challenge would not prevail.", "PERMNO": 56274, "SIC": 2000, "TIC": "CAG"}
