RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risks\nOur businesses are subject to a number of inherent risks. We believe that the primary risks affecting our businesses and an investment in our common units are:\n\u2022 a complex regulatory and tax environment involving rules and regulations, some of which are outdated relative to today's complex financial activities and some of which are subject to political influence, which could restrict our operations or the operations of our funds and portfolio companies and subject us to increased compliance costs and administrative burdens, as well as restrictions on our business activities;\n\u2022 the potential enactment of legislation that would preclude us from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules. If this or any similar legislation or regulation were to be enacted and to apply to us, we would incur a material increase in our tax liability;\n\u2022 poor performance by our funds due to market conditions, political environments, monetary and fiscal policy or other conditions beyond our control;\n\u2022 the reputational harm that we would experience as a result of inappropriately addressing conflicts of interest, poor performance by the investments we manage or the actual or alleged failure by us, our employees, our funds or our portfolio companies to comply with applicable regulations in an increasingly complex political and regulatory environment;\n\u2022 potential variability in our period to period earnings due primarily to mark-to-market valuations of our funds' investments. As a result of this variability, the market price of our common units may be volatile and subject to fluctuations;\n\u2022 the increasing demands of the investing community, including the potential for fee compression and changes to other terms, which could materially adversely affect our revenues; and\n\u2022 an investment in our common units is not an investment in our underlying funds. Moreover, there can be no assurance that projections respecting performance of our underlying funds or unrealized values will be achieved.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nOur businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to our taxation, taxation of our investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on alternative asset managers), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions. Ongoing developments in the U.S. and global financial markets following the unprecedented turmoil in the global capital markets and the financial services industry in late 2008 and early 2009 continue to illustrate that the current environment is still one of uncertainty and instability for investment management businesses. While there has been significant recovery in the capital markets since\nthen, particularly in the equity markets, concerns over falling oil prices towards the end of 2014, concerns over increasing interest rates, particularly short-term rates, increases in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar, sluggish economic expansion in non-U.S. economies, including continued concerns over growth prospects in China and emerging markets, growing debt loads for certain countries and uncertainty about the consequences of the U.S. and other governments withdrawing monetary stimulus measures, all highlight the fact that economic conditions remain unpredictable. These and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy have resulted in, and may continue to result in, adverse consequences for many of our funds, each of which could adversely affect the business of such funds, restrict such funds' investment activities and impede such funds' ability to effectively achieve their investment objectives.\nDifficult economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results by causing:\n\u2022 decreases in the market value of securities and debt instruments held by some of our funds;\n\u2022 illiquidity in the market, which could adversely affect transaction volumes and the pace of realization of our funds' investments or otherwise restrict the ability of our funds to realize value from their investments, thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate incentive or other income;\n\u2022 our assets under management to decrease, lowering management fees payable by our funds; and\n\u2022 increases in costs or reduced availability of financial instruments that finance our private equity and real estate funds.\nWhile the adverse effects of late 2008 and early 2009 have greatly diminished, global financial markets have continued to experience volatility at various times since, including in response to the downgrade by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (\"S&P\") in August 2011 of the long-term credit rating of U.S. Treasury debt from AAA to AA+ and the Federal Reserve's communication in May 2013 that it could slow the pace of asset purchases. Although credit spreads have tightened and all-in financing costs are below those prevailing prior to the recession, there is concern that the favorability of market conditions may be dependent on continued monetary policy accommodation from central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve. Economic activity and employment in developed economies remain below levels implied by pre-recession trends and financial institutions have not provided debt financing in amounts and on terms commensurate with that provided prior to 2008, particularly in Europe. Continued weakness could result in lower returns than we anticipated at the time certain of our investments were made.\nDuring periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which we invest may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. During such periods, these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations and be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including expenses payable to us. Negative financial results in our funds' portfolio companies may reduce the value of our portfolio companies and the investment returns for our funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In addition, such conditions would increase the risk of default with respect to credit-oriented or debt investments. Our funds may be affected by reduced opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments, by lower than expected returns on investments made prior to the deterioration of the credit markets, and by the fact that we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital, which could adversely affect our ability to raise new funds and thus adversely impact our prospects for future growth.\nPolitical and regulatory conditions, including the effects of negative publicity surrounding the financial industry in general and proposed legislation, could adversely affect our businesses or cause a material increase in our tax liability.\nAs a result of market disruptions and highly publicized financial scandals in recent years, regulators and investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and the businesses in which we operate both in the United States and outside the United States will be subject to new or additional regulations. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the Commission, the CFTC or other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. See \"-Regulatory changes in the United States and regulatory compliance failures could adversely affect our reputation, businesses and operations.\"\nOn several occasions in recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would repeal the exception from taxation as a corporation currently available to certain publicly traded partnerships. Legislation was introduced in the last Congress that, if enacted in the form proposed, would cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and subject us to U.S. corporate income tax on our net corporate taxable income. If this or any similar legislation or regulation were to be enacted and to apply to us, we would incur a material increase in our tax liability and our cash available for distribution would be reduced, which could reduce the value of our common units. Over the past years, members of the U.S. Congress have also proposed amendments to the Code, and the rules and regulations thereunder that, if enacted, would raise the tax on carried interest and treat carried interest as ordinary income as well as change the tax treatment of investment managers and investment structures. A number of similar legislative proposals have been introduced in state legislatures. If this or any similar legislation or regulation were to become law, our effective tax rate could increase significantly. In addition, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, has identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for the next Congress. If this or any similar legislation or regulation were to become law, our effective tax rate could increase significantly, and such legislation could materially increase the amount of taxes that we, our professionals and other key personnel would be required to pay. See \"-Risks Related to U.S. Taxation.\"\nCongress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational entities. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, the Obama administration has announced proposals for potential reform to the U.S. federal income tax rules for businesses, including reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations, anti-inversion rules, reducing the top marginal rate on corporations and subjecting entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes to an entity-level income tax similar to the corporate income tax. Several of these proposals for reform, if enacted by the United States or by other countries in which we or our affiliates invest or do business, could adversely affect our investment returns. Whether these or other proposals will be enacted by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of any such proposed legislation. See \"-Risks Related to U.S. Taxation.\"\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors. If we were unable to raise such capital, we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments, which would materially reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to alternative managers, including\nprivate funds and hedge funds, to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds' performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds depends on our funds' performance. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future funds. If we were unable to successfully raise capital, our revenue and cash flow would be reduced, and our financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, while our existing owners have committed substantial capital to our funds, there can be no assurance that there will be further commitments to our funds, and any future investments by them in our funds or other alternative investment categories will likely depend on the performance of our funds, the performance of their overall investment portfolios and other investment opportunities available to them.\nWe depend on our Co-Founders, senior professionals and other key personnel, and our ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to our success and our growth prospects.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of our Co-Founders, senior professionals and other key personnel. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our senior professionals and other key personnel and our ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds' investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds' investment opportunities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with our investors. Therefore, if any of our senior professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors.\nThe departure or bad acts for any reason of any of our senior professionals, or a significant number of our other investment professionals, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives, cause certain of our investors to withdraw capital they invest with us or elect not to commit additional capital to our funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals could also trigger certain \"key man\" provisions in the documentation governing certain of our funds, which would permit the investors in those funds to suspend or terminate such funds' investment periods or, in the case of certain funds, permit investors to withdraw their capital prior to expiration of the applicable lock-up date. We do not carry any \"key man\" insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our senior professionals, and we do not have a policy that prohibits our senior professionals from traveling together. See \"-Employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\"\nWe anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals both to grow our businesses and to replace those who depart. However, the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive, both in the United States and internationally, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or we may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and attract investment professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability or result in an increase in the portion of our performance fees that we grant to our investment professionals. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred equity compensation expenses of $83.2 million (including in connection with our initial public offering) and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the future as we increase the use of equity compensation awards to attract, retain and compensate employees.\nOur failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\nAs we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds' investment activities. Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund may give rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to trade in the securities of such company. We may also cause different private equity funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. We may also cause different funds that we advise to purchase different classes of securities in the same portfolio company. For example, in the normal course of business our Tradable Credit funds acquire debt positions in companies in which our private equity funds own common equity securities. A direct conflict of interest could arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a company were to develop insolvency concerns, and we would have to carefully manage that conflict. Certain funds in different groups may invest alongside each other in the same security. The different investment objectives or fund terms of such funds may result in a potential conflict of interest. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us, our funds and their portfolio companies. Though we believe we have appropriate means and oversight to resolve these conflicts, our judgment on any particular allocation could be challenged. While we have developed general guidelines regarding when two or more funds can invest in different parts of the same company's capital structure and created a process that we employ to handle such conflicts if they arise, our decision to permit the investments to occur in the first instance or our judgment on how to minimize the conflict could be challenged. If we fail to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. We compete with a number of private equity funds, specialized funds, hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional asset managers, real estate development companies, commercial banks, investment banks, other investment managers and other financial institutions, as well as sovereign wealth funds. Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including:\n\u2022 a number of our competitors in some of our businesses have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022 some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors' funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022 several of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our funds, particularly our funds that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio investments to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds than us, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;\n\u2022 some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do;\n\u2022 our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment; and\n\u2022 other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nWe may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment valuations, structures and terms offered by our competitors. Alternatively, we may experience decreased profitability, rates of return and increased risks of loss if we match investment valuations, structures and terms offered by our competitors. Moreover, if we are forced to compete with other investment managers on the basis of price when fundraising, we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee and carried interest terms. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds, and not on the level of our fees or carried interest relative to those of our competitors. However, there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee or carried interest reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our businesses, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nLastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many of our funds seek to exploit.\nPoor performance of our funds would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay performance fees previously paid to us and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWe derive revenues in part from:\n\u2022 management fees, which are based generally on the amount of capital committed to or invested in our funds;\n\u2022 performance fees, based on the performance of our funds; and\n\u2022 returns on investments of our own capital in the funds we sponsor and manage.\nWhen any of our funds perform poorly, either by incurring losses or underperforming benchmarks, as compared to our competitors or otherwise, our investment record suffers. As a result, our performance\nfees may be adversely affected and, all else being equal, the value of our assets under management could decrease, which may, in turn, reduce our management fees. Moreover, we may experience losses on investments of our own capital as a result of poor investment performance, including investments in our own funds. If a fund performs poorly, we will receive little or no performance fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from our own principal investment in such fund. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance or otherwise, a fund does not achieve total investment returns that exceed a specified investment return threshold over the life of the fund or other measurement period, we may be obligated to repay the amount by which performance fees that were previously distributed or paid to us exceeds amounts to which we were entitled. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in our closed-end funds may decline to invest in future closed-end funds we raise as a result of poor performance. Our fund investors and potential fund investors continually assess our funds' performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds and avoid excessive redemption levels depends on our funds' performance. Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and, ultimately, our management fee income. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue.\nARCC's management fee comprises a significant portion of our management fees and a reduction in fees from ARCC could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the management fees we received from ARCC comprised approximately 41% of our management fees (including 20% attributable to ARCC Part I Fees). The investment advisory agreement we have with ARCC categorizes the fees we receive as: (a) base management fees, which are paid quarterly and generally increase or decrease based on ARCC's total assets, (b) fees based on ARCC's net investment income (before ARCC Part I Fees and ARCC Part II Fees), which are paid quarterly (\"ARCC Part I Fees\") and (c) fees based on ARCC's net capital gains, which are paid annually (\"ARCC Part II Fees\"). We classify the ARCC Part I Fees as management fees because they are paid quarterly, are predictable and recurring in nature, are not subject to repayment (or clawback) and are generally cash-settled each quarter. If ARCC's total assets or its net investment income were to decline significantly for any reason, including without limitation, due to mark-to-market accounting requirements, the poor performance of its investments or the failure to successfully access or invest capital, the amount of the fees we receive from ARCC, including the base management fee and the ARCC Part I Fees, would also decline significantly, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, because the ARCC Part II Fees are not paid unless ARCC achieves cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation), ARCC's Part II Fees payable to us are variable and not predictable.\nOur investment advisory and management agreement with ARCC renews for successive annual periods subject to the approval of ARCC's board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of ARCC's outstanding voting securities. In addition, as required by the Investment Company Act, both ARCC and its investment adviser have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. Termination or non-renewal of this agreement would reduce our revenues significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees. Although our investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been\na general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In September 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners Association (\"ILPA\") published a set of Private Equity Principles (the \"Principles\") which were revised in January 2011. The Principles were developed to encourage discussion between limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms. Certain of the Principles call for enhanced \"alignment of interests\" between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including proposed guidelines for fees and performance income structures. We promptly provided ILPA with our endorsement of the Principles, representing an indication of our general support for the efforts of ILPA. Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our funds. More recently institutional investors have been allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies as well as attempting to reduce management and investment fees to external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals or rebates. We cannot assure holders of our common units that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new businesses could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. For more information about our fees see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nInvestors in our funds may be unwilling to commit new capital to our funds as a result of our decision to become a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nSome investors in our funds may have concerns that as a public company our attention will be bifurcated between investors in our funds and the public unitholders, resulting in potential conflicts of interest. Some investors in our funds may believe that as a public company, we will strive for near-term profit instead of superior risk-adjusted returns for investors in our funds over time or grow our assets under management for the purpose of generating additional management fees without regard to whether we believe there are sufficient investment opportunities to effectively deploy the additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address such concerns or to convince investors in our funds that our status as a public company will not affect our longstanding priorities or the way we conduct our businesses. A decision by a significant number of investors in our funds not to commit additional capital to our funds or to cease doing business with us altogether could inhibit our ability to achieve our investment objectives and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRapid growth of our businesses, particularly outside the United States, may be difficult to sustain and may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.\nOur assets under management have grown significantly in the past, and we are pursuing further growth in the near future, both organic and through acquisitions. Our rapid growth has placed, and planned growth, if successful, will continue to place, significant demands on our legal, accounting and operational infrastructure, and has increased expenses. The complexity of these demands, and the expense required to address them, is a function not simply of the amount by which our assets under management has grown, but of the growth in the variety and complexity of, as well as the differences in strategy between, our different funds. In addition, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments.\nOur future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, we face significant challenges:\n\u2022 in maintaining adequate financial, regulatory (legal, tax and compliance) and business controls;\n\u2022 in implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 in training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our businesses on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nIn addition, pursuing investment opportunities outside the United States presents challenges not faced by U.S. investments, such as different legal and tax regimes and currency fluctuations, which require additional resources to address. To accommodate the needs of global investors and strategies we must structure investment products in a manner that addresses tax, regulatory and legislative provisions in different, and sometimes multiple, jurisdictions. Further, in conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, we are often faced with the challenge of ensuring that our activities are consistent with U.S. or other laws with extraterritorial application, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). Moreover, actively pursuing international investment opportunities may require that we increase the size or number of our international offices. Pursuing non-U.S. fund investors means that we must comply with international laws governing the sale of interests in our funds, different investor reporting and information processes and other requirements. As a result, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing complexity and sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting and regulatory situations. This growth has required, and will continue to require, us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding international operations effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow this part of our businesses, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control our expenses.\nWe may enter into new lines of business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend, if market conditions warrant, to grow our businesses by increasing assets under management in existing businesses and expanding into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our partnership agreement will permit us to enter into new lines of business, make strategic investments or acquisitions and enter into joint ventures. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. In addition, consistent with our past experience, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers.\nAttempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special risks, including some or all of the following:\n\u2022 the required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022 the assumption of liabilities in any acquired business;\n\u2022 the disruption of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022 entry into markets or lines of business in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022 increasing demands on our operational and management systems and controls;\n\u2022 compliance with additional regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 potential increase in investor concentration; and\n\u2022 the broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, we cannot identify for holders of our common units all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and their investment that may result from any attempted expansion.\nIf we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on the selective development or acquisition of asset management businesses, advisory businesses or other businesses complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners and (f) our ability to properly manage conflicts of interest. Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business, financial results and the market price for our common units may be adversely affected.\nExtensive regulation in the United States affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The Commission oversees the activities of our subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Advisers Act\"). Since the first quarter of 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") as well as the Commission has overseen the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary Ares Investor Services LLC as a registered broker-dealer. We are subject to audits by the Defense Security Service to determine whether we are under foreign ownership, control or influence. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could be subject to regulatory action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. For example, in 2013 the Commission amended Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act to impose \"bad actor\" disqualification provisions that ban an issuer from offering or selling securities pursuant to the safe harbor in Rule 506 if the issuer, or any other \"covered person,\" is the subject of a criminal, regulatory or court order or other \"disqualifying event\" under the rule which has not been waived by the Commission. The definition of a \"covered person\" under the rule includes an issuer's directors, general partners, managing members and executive officers; and promoters and persons compensated for\nsoliciting investors in the offering. Accordingly, our ability to rely on Rule 506 to offer or sell securities would be impaired if we or any \"covered person\" is the subject of a disqualifying event under the rule and we are unable to obtain a waiver.\nThe Commission has indicated that investment advisors who receive transaction-based compensation for investment banking or acquisition activities relating to fund portfolio companies may be required to register as broker-dealers. Specifically, the Commission staff has noted that if a firm receives fees from a fund portfolio company in connection with the acquisition, disposition or recapitalization of such portfolio company, such activities could raise broker-dealer concerns under applicable regulations related to broker dealers. If we receive such transaction fees and the Commission takes the position that such activities render us a \"broker\" under the applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, we could be subject to additional regulation. If receipt of transaction fees from a portfolio company is determined to require a broker-dealer license, receipt of such transaction fees in the past or in the future during any time when we did not or do not have a broker-dealer license could subject us to liability for fines, penalties or damages.\nSince 2010, states and other regulatory authorities have begun to require investment managers to register as lobbyists. We have registered as such in a number of jurisdictions, including California, Illinois and New York. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of U.S. and foreign securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of our relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers or registered broker-dealers. The regulations to which our businesses are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in our funds and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our common unitholders. Even if a sanction imposed against us, one of our subsidiaries or our personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us.\nOur publicly traded investment vehicles are subject to regulatory complexities that limit the way in which they do business and may subject them to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.\nOur publicly traded investment vehicles operate under a complex regulatory environment. Such companies require the application of complex tax and securities regulations and may entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, regulations affecting our publicly traded investment vehicles generally affect their ability to take certain actions. For example, each of our publicly traded vehicles has elected to be treated as a REIT or RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To maintain their status as a RIC or a REIT, such vehicles must meet, among other things, certain source of income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. ARCC and our publicly traded closed-end funds are subject to complex\nrules under the Investment Company Act, including rules that restrict certain of our funds from engaging in transactions with ARCC or the closed-end funds. Under the regulatory and business environment in which it operates, ARCC must periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments in excess of its repayments to grow. This results from ARCC being required to generally distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income to maintain its RIC status, combined with regulations under the Investment Company Act that, subject to certain exceptions, generally prohibit ARCC from issuing and selling its common stock at a price below net asset value per share and from incurring indebtedness (including for this purpose, preferred stock), if ARCC's asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals less than 200% after such incurrence.\nFailure to comply with \"pay to play\" regulations implemented by the Commission and certain states, and changes to the \"pay to play\" regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our businesses.\nIn recent years, the Commission and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. In June 2010, the Commission approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment Advisers Act regarding \"pay to play\" practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser's employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the Commission to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \"pay to play\" practices by investment advisers.\nSimilar rule-making and investigations have also occurred in New York. In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the \"N.Y. Attorney General\") commenced an industry-wide investigation into pay-to-play allegations and undisclosed conflicts of interest at public pension funds, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund. As a consequence of the N.Y. Attorney General's investigation, the N.Y. Attorney General adopted a Public Pension Fund Reform Code of Conduct (the \"Reform Code of Conduct\") for U.S. public pension funds. This Reform Code of Conduct, among other things, restricts the use of third-party intermediaries and placement agents with respect to the solicitation of funds from U.S. public pension funds. In 2010, we agreed to adopt the Reform Code of Conduct, acknowledging that the Reform Code of Conduct would enhance transparency in fundraising activities before public pension funds on a national basis. As a signatory to the Reform Code of Conduct, we may be at a disadvantage to other fund sponsors that are not similarly restricted from engaging third-party solicitors, notwithstanding that many states and public pension funds have adopted similar restrictions.\nAs we have a significant number of public pension plans that are investors in our funds, these rules could impose significant economic sanctions on our businesses if we or one of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan. In addition, such investigations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the new Basel III capital standards is uncertain.\nIn June 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international trade body comprised of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from 27 countries, including the United States and the European Union, announced the final framework for a comprehensive set of capital and liquidity standards, commonly referred to as \"Basel III,\" for internationally active banking organizations and certain other types of financial institutions. These new standards, which will be fully phased in by 2019, will require banks to hold more capital, predominantly in the form of common equity, than under the current capital framework. Implementation of Basel III will require implementing regulations and guidelines by member countries. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking regulators announced the adoption of final regulations to implement Basel III for U.S. banking organizations, subject to various transition periods. The EU implemented Basel III in June 2013 CRD IV. Compliance with the Basel III standards may result in significant costs to banking organizations, which in turn may result in higher borrowing costs for the private sector and reduced access to certain types of credit.\nRegulatory changes in the United States and regulatory compliance failures could adversely affect our reputation, businesses and operations.\nIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant new regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including oversight and regulation of systemic market risk (including the power to liquidate certain institutions); authorizing the Federal Reserve to regulate nonbank institutions that are deemed systemically important; generally prohibiting insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company; any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of any of these types of entities, regardless of geographic location, from conducting proprietary trading or investing in or sponsoring a \"covered fund,\" which includes private equity funds and hedge funds (i.e. the Volcker Rule); and imposing new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while several key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, many aspects will be implemented by various regulatory bodies over the next several years. While we already have several subsidiaries registered as investment advisers subject to Commission examinations and another subsidiary registered as a broker-dealer subject to Commission and FINRA examinations, the imposition of any additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a ten voting-member Financial Stability Oversight Council (the \"Council\"), an interagency body chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, to identify and manage systemic risk in the financial system and improve interagency cooperation. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council has the authority to review the activities of certain nonbank financial firms engaged in financial activities that are designated as \"systemically important,\" meaning, among other things, evaluating the impact of the distress of the financial firm on the stability of the U.S. economy. If we were designated as such, it would result in increased regulation of our businesses, including the imposition of capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management standards, credit exposure reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions and annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.\nIn October 2011, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the \"Volcker Rule.\" In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring \"covered funds,\" which include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other proprietary activities. The effects of the Volcker Rule are uncertain but it is in any\nevent likely to curtail various banking activities that in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets as well as our business. The final Volcker Rule became effective on April 1, 2014 and is subject to a conformance period (ending July 21, 2016). It contains exemptions for certain \"permitted activities\" that would enable certain institutions subject to the Volcker Rule to continue investing in covered funds under certain conditions. Although we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect our fundraising to any significant extent, there is uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and its practical implications, and there could be adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition.\nIn March 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published revised guidance regarding expectations for banks' leveraged lending activities. This guidance, in addition to proposed Dodd-Frank risk retention rules circulated in August 2013, could further restrict credit availability, as well as potentially restrict the activities of our Tradable Credit Group, which supports many of its portfolio investments from banks' lending activities. This could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to our funds and their portfolio companies. See \"-Our use of leverage to finance our businesses exposes us to substantial risks\" and \"Risks Related to Our Funds-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of returns on those investments.\"\nPursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, regulation of the U.S. derivatives market is bifurcated between the CFTC and the Commission. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has jurisdiction over swaps and the Commission has jurisdiction over security-based swaps. As part of its Dodd Frank Act related rule-making process, the CFTC made changes to its rules with respect to the registration and oversight of CPOs. Previously, the CPO registration rules had applied to the operator of a fund invested in \"commodity interests,\" meaning that the fund entered into futures or options with respect to commodities. As a result of the CFTC's revisions to these rules, all swaps (other than security-based swaps) are now included in the definition of commodity interests. As a result, funds that utilize swaps (whether or not related to a physical commodity) as part of their business model may fall within the statutory definition of a commodity pool. If a fund qualifies as a commodity pool, then, absent an available exemption, the operator of such fund is required to register with the CFTC as a CPO. Registration with the CFTC renders such CPO subject to regulation, including with respect to disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct.\nCertain of our funds may from time to time, directly or indirectly, invest in instruments that meet the definition of a \"swap\" under the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC's rules promulgated thereunder. As a result, such funds may qualify as commodity pools, and the operators of such funds may need to register as CPOs unless an exemption applies. The operators of our funds may therefore seek to rely on no-action relief or claim an exemption from registration as a CPO with the CFTC, including pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3). CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) provides an exemption from CPO registration for the operator of a fund, or pool, if (among other things) that pool's trading in commodity interest positions (including both hedging and speculative positions, and positions in security futures) is limited so that either (i) no more than 5% of the liquidation value of the pool's portfolio is used as initial margin, premiums and required minimum security deposits to establish such positions, or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of the pool's trading in such positions does not exceed 100% of the pool's liquidation value. If the operators of our funds are able to rely on an exemption from CPO registration pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), then unlike a registered CPO, the fund's operator would not be required to provide prospective investors with a CFTC compliant disclosure document, nor would it be required to provide investors with periodic account statements or certified annual reports that satisfy the requirements of CFTC rules applicable to registered CPOs. As an alternative to the exemption from registration, the operators of one of more of our funds may register as CPOs with the CFTC, in which case such operators may seek to avail themselves of certain disclosure, reporting and record-keeping relief under CFTC Rule 4.7.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the Commission and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules relating to the regulation of the derivatives market. Such rules require or will require the registration of certain market participants, the clearing of certain derivatives contracts through central counterparties, the execution of certain derivatives contracts on electronic platforms, as well as reporting and recordkeeping of derivatives transactions. The Dodd Frank Act also provides expanded enforcement authority to the CFTC and Commission. While certain rules have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing. In particular, the CFTC has finalized most of its rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Commission has proposed several rules regarding security-based swaps but has only finalized a small number of these rules. We cannot therefore yet predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business.\nUnder CFTC rules, an entity may be required to register as a MSP if it has substantial swaps positions or has substantial counterparty exposure from its swaps positions. If any of our funds were required to register as an MSP, it could make compliance more expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, if any of our funds qualify as \"special entities\" under CFTC rules, it could make it more difficult for them to enter into derivatives transactions or make such transactions more expensive.\nThe CFTC has issued final rules imposing reporting and recordkeeping requirements on swaps market participants. Such rules are currently effective and could significantly increase operating costs. These additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements may require additional compliance resources and may also have a negative effect on market liquidity, which could negatively impact commodity prices and our ability to hedge our price risks.\nPursuant to a rule finalized by the CFTC in December 2012, certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of index credit default swaps are now subject to mandatory clearing, unless an exemption applies. As of February 2014, many of these interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps are also now subject to mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. In December 2014, the CFTC announced that its Subcommittee on Foreign Exchange Markets submitted a report to the CFTC's Global Markets Advisory Committee regarding a potential clearing mandate for foreign exchange non-deliverable forwards. At this time, the CFTC has not proposed any rules designating other classes of swaps for mandatory clearing, but it may do so in the future. Mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use, and exposes us to the credit risk of the clearing house through which any cleared swap is cleared. In addition, with respect to any uncleared swaps that we enter into, the CFTC or applicable federal banking regulatory authorities may impose credit support documentation and margin requirements. At this time, rules with respect to the margining of uncleared swaps are in proposed form and therefore the application of those rules to us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has also issued proposed rules to set position limits for futures, options, and swap contracts in certain commodities. These position limits will likely be aggregated among all entities under common control, unless an exemption applies, which could affect our ability and the ability for our funds to enter into derivatives transactions. Additionally, while the CFTC's proposal would only apply to derivatives on certain energy, metal and agricultural commodities, it is possible that the CFTC may expand such requirements to other types of contracts in the future. It is uncertain at this time, though, whether, when, and to what extent the CFTC's position limits rules will become final and effective.\nThe CFTC has finalized rules requiring collateral used to margin cleared swaps to be segregated in a manner different from that applicable to the futures market and has finalized other rules allowing parties to an uncleared swap to require that any collateral posted as initial margin be segregated with a third party custodian. Collateral segregation may impose greater costs on us when entering into swaps.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFTC expanded anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority, including authority over disruptive trading practices and insider trading. Several investigations have\ncommenced in the United States related to manipulation of the foreign exchange, LIBOR and indices markets. It is possible that new standards will emerge from these proceedings that could impact the way that we trade.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to adopt and disclose policies requiring, in the event the company is required to issue an accounting restatement, the clawback of related incentive compensation from current and former executive officers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the Commission and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower.\nThe Commission requires investment advisers registered or required to register with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150.0 million in private fund assets under management to periodically file reports on Form PF. We have filed, and will continue to file, quarterly reports on Form PF, which has resulted in increased administrative costs and requires a significant amount of attention and time to be spent by our personnel.\nMany of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, such as the Council and the Federal Reserve.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of the Dodd-Frank Act or any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses, including the changes described above, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our funds. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability.\nRegulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our businesses.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate outside the United States. In the United Kingdom, Ares Management Limited and Ares Management UK Limited are subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (which replaced the U.K. Financial Services Authority in April 2013).\nIn March 2013, the Financial Services Authority published the FCA Rules for the FCA's regulation and supervision of the LIBOR. In particular, the FCA Rules include requirements that (1) an independent LIBOR administrator monitor and survey LIBOR submissions to identify breaches of practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior, and (2) firms submitting data to LIBOR establish and maintain a clear conflicts of interest policy and appropriate systems and controls. These requirements may cause LIBOR to be more volatile than it has been in the past, which may adversely affect the value of investments made by our funds. On February 3, 2014, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited took responsibility for administering LIBOR, following regulatory authorization by the FCA. It is uncertain whether corresponding changes will be made to the EURIBOR although there is proposed EU legislation\nto govern benchmarks such as LIBOR and EURIBOR in order to enhance their robustness and reliability. The precise scope and timeline is unknown but if agreement is reached in 2015, new legislation could come into force in 2016.\nEuropean Union legislation could impact our business in the United Kingdom and in other EU member states where we have operations. The following measures are of particular relevance to our business.\nThe Directive and CRD IV legislation could restrict the ability of banks and AIFs managed in the EU to invest in securitization vehicles including collateralized loan obligations operated by us unless either the \"originator\", \"original lender\" or \"sponsor\" (as those terms are defined in the legislation) retains a prescribed interest in the securitization concerned. Where such securitization arrangements are managed by Ares-affiliated undertakings, this risk retention requirement will, at present, need to be held by an appropriately (EU) authorized and regulated entity affiliated with us (i.e. as \"sponsor\"). The holding of that retention on our affiliate's balance sheet is likely to increase that entity's regulatory capital requirement and will accordingly adversely affect return on equity.\nThe EU Regulation on OTC derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories (commonly known as EMIR will require the mandatory clearing of certain over-the counter (\"OTC\") derivatives through central counterparties. This mandatory clearing obligation is expected to begin to come into force in stages from early 2015 and will apply to \"financial counterparties\" (which includes, for example, an investment firm authorized under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive or an EEA or non-EEA AIF managed by an investment fund manager authorized under the Directive) that enters into an eligible derivative transaction with another financial counterparty or a non-financial counterparty whose OTC derivative exposures exceed a prescribed clearing threshold. An OTC derivative trade will be eligible if it meets certain pre-defined eligibility criteria (such as levels of standardization and liquidity). A central counterparty will typically require the posting of initial and valuation margin in respect of cleared transactions. In addition, EMIR will require certain parties to non-centrally cleared OTC derivative transactions to mitigate their risks by posting prescribed types and values of initial and variation margin. These margin requirements could increase the cost to us and our funds when transacting in eligible OTC derivatives.\nOn January 29, 2014 the European Commission published a proposal for a new regulation dealing with structural measures to improve the resilience of EU credit institutions. Provisions in the proposed regulation would prohibit systemically important EU banks from acquiring, owning, sponsoring or having an exposure to an alternative investment fund that is leveraged. It is not clear whether the phrase \"have an exposure to\" was intended to be confined to restricting equity exposures, but it is understood that systemically important EU banks would continue to be able to lend to funds. This is the so-called \"Barnier rule\", which is the European equivalent of the Volcker rule (see \"-Regulatory changes in the United States and regulatory compliance failures could adversely affect our reputation, business and operations\"). Draft compromise texts from the European Council and the European Parliament suggest there might not be a Volcker-rule equivalent but rather mandatory structural separation of deposit taking activities from other banking activities. The precise scope of this proposed regulation and its timescale for coming into force is currently uncertain, but, if agreed between EU institutions, it is likely that provisions of this regulation could come into force in phases from January 2017. The final proposals may affect our ability to raise capital in our funds from EU banks.\nOur other European and Asian operations and our investment activities worldwide are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary by country. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the regulations of certain foreign countries in conducting our asset management activities.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel,\npermissions to carry on particular activities. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of foreign (as well as U.S.) securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information and market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions or prohibitions on our activities and damage to our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us. In addition, increasing global regulatory oversight of fundraising activities, including local registration requirements in various jurisdictions and the addition of new compliance regimes, could make it more difficult for us to raise new funds or could increase the cost of raising such funds.\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\nThe Directive was enacted in July 2011 and took effect on July 22, 2013. The Directive applies to (a) AIFMs established in the EEA that manage EEA or non-EEA AIFs, (b) non-EEA AIFMs that manage EEA AIFs and (c) non-EEA AIFMs that market their AIFs to professional investors within the EEA.\nBeginning July 22, 2013, the Directive imposed new operating requirements on EEA AIFMs. AIFMs must comply with all the requirements of the Directive, including becoming appropriately authorized by their home-country regulator. EEA AIFMs and non-EEA AIFMs seeking to market an AIF within the EEA need to comply with the Directive's disclosure and transparency requirements and, in the case of non-EEA AIFMs, jurisdiction specific private placement regimes (which have been modified as a result of the Directive).\nThe full scope of the Directive may also be extended to non-EEA AIFMs that wish to market an AIF within the EEA pursuant to a pan-European marketing passport (instead of under national private placement regimes). Whether this will occur and the timescale for such changes is currently uncertain and is contingent on an opinion that the European Securities and Markets Authority is expected to deliver in 2015. Certain of the jurisdiction specific private placement regimes may also be removed at this point.\nThe operating requirements imposed by the Directive include, among other things, rules relating to the remuneration of certain personnel, minimum regulatory capital requirements, restrictions on the use of leverage, restrictions on early distributions relating to portfolio companies (so-called \"asset stripping\" rules), disclosure and reporting requirements to both investors and home state regulators, the independent valuation of an AIF's assets and the appointment of an independent depository to hold assets. As a result, the Directive could in the future have an adverse effect on our businesses by, among other things, increasing the regulatory burden and costs of doing business in or relating to EEA member states, imposing extensive disclosure obligations on, and asset stripping rules with respect to, companies, if any, in which any of our funds invest that are located in EEA member states, significantly restricting marketing activities within the EEA, potentially requiring certain of our funds to change their compensation structures for key personnel, thereby affecting our ability to recruit and retain these personnel, and potentially disadvantaging our funds as investors in private companies located in EEA member states when compared to non-AIF/AIFM competitors that may not be subject to the requirements of the Directive, thereby potentially restricting our funds' ability to make investments in such companies.\nThe Directive allows AIFMs to invest in securitizations on behalf of the alternative investment funds they manage only if the originator, sponsor or original lender for the securitization has explicitly disclosed that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest of not less than 5% of the nominal value of the securitized exposures or of the tranches sold to investors and certain due diligence undertakings are made. AIFMs that discover after the assumption of a securitization exposure that the retained interest does not meet the requirements, or subsequently falls below 5% of the economic risk, are required to take such corrective action as is in the best interests of investors. It remains to be seen how this\nrequirement will be addressed by AIFMs should these circumstances arise. These requirements, along with other changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of securitizations, may negatively affect the value of investments made by our funds.\nThe Directive could also limit our operating flexibility and our investment opportunities, as well as expose us and/or our funds to conflicting regulatory requirements in the United States (and elsewhere). The final scope and requirements of the Directive remain subject to enactment of EU secondary legislation and national implementing legislation in certain EU member states where implementation has been delayed.\nSolvency II\nSolvency II sets out stronger capital adequacy and risk management requirements for European insurers and reinsurers and, in particular, dictates how much capital such firms must hold against their liabilities and introduces a risk-based assessment of those liabilities. Solvency II came into force on January 1, 2010 but is only required to be implemented by firms on January 1, 2016. Solvency II imposes, among other things, substantially greater quantitative and qualitative capital requirements for insurers and reinsurers as well as other supervisory and disclosure requirements. We are not subject to Solvency II; however, many of our European insurer or reinsurer fund investors will be subject to this directive, as applied under applicable domestic law and are already taking steps to implement the requirements. Solvency II may impact insurers' and reinsurers' investment decisions and their asset allocations. In addition, insurers and reinsurers will be subject to more onerous data collation and reporting requirements. As a result, Solvency II could have an adverse indirect effect on our businesses by, among other things, restricting the ability of European insurers and reinsurers to invest in our funds and imposing on us extensive disclosure and reporting obligations for those insurers and reinsurers that do invest in our funds. The final details and requirements of the subsidiary regulations pursuant to the Solvency II directive remain uncertain and are subject to change as a result of enactment both of related EU legislation and national implementing legislation in EU member states.\nRegulations governing ARCC's operation as a business development company affect its ability to raise, and the way in which it raises, additional capital.\nAs a business development company, ARCC operates as a highly regulated business within the provisions of the Investment Company Act. Many of the regulations governing business development companies have not been modernized within recent securities laws amendments and restrict, among other things, leverage incurrence, co-investments and other transactions with other entities within the Ares Operating Group. Certain of our funds may be restricted from engaging in transactions with ARCC and its subsidiaries.\nAs a business development company registered under the Investment Company Act, ARCC may issue debt securities or preferred stock and borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \"senior securities,\" up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, ARCC is permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of its assets declines, it may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, it may be required to sell a portion of its investments and, depending on the nature of its leverage, repay a portion of its indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Business development companies may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances, one of which is during an approximately one-year period after obtaining stockholder approval for such issuance in accordance with the Investment Company Act. ARCC's stockholders have, in the past, approved such issuances so that during the subsequent 12-month period, ARCC may, in one or more public or private offerings of its common stock, sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share,\nsubject to certain conditions including parameters on the level of permissible dilution, approval of the sale by a majority of its independent directors and a requirement that the sale price be not less than approximately the market price of the shares of its common stock at specified times, less the expenses of the sale. ARCC may ask its stockholders for additional approvals from year to year. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.\nWe are subject to risks in using prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents.\nMany of our funds depend on the services of prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new regulation of the derivatives market. In particular, some of our funds utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these funds with these counterparties.\nOur funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, our risk-management models may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.\nAlthough we have risk-management models and processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, most of our funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker's, custodian's or counterparty's unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, our funds' cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker's, custodian's or counterparty's own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. If our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. The CFTC is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.\nThe counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, the consolidation and elimination of\ncounterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties, and our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. In addition, counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing.\nA portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow is variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our common units to decline.\nA portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow is nevertheless variable, primarily due to the fact that the performance fees that we receive from certain of our funds can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition, the investment returns of most of our funds are volatile. We may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds' investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of our common units and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period. It may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the price of our common units or increased volatility in the price of our common units generally.\nThe timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain and will contribute to the volatility of our results. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. We recognize revenue on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds, and a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue, which could increase the volatility of our results.\nWith respect to our funds that generate carried interest, the timing and receipt of such carried interest varies with the life cycle of our funds. During periods in which a relatively large portion of our assets under management is attributable to funds and investments in their \"harvesting\" period, our funds would make larger distributions than in the fund-raising or investment periods that precede harvesting. During periods in which a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower carried interest distributions. Moreover, we receive carried interest payments only upon realization of investments by the relevant fund, which contributes to the volatility of our cash flow.\nWith respect to our funds that pay an incentive fee, the incentive fee is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. In many cases, we earn this incentive fee only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular threshold. Some of our funds also have \"high water marks\" with respect to the investors in these funds. If the high water mark for a particular investor is not surpassed, we would not earn an incentive fee with respect to such investor during a particular period even if such investor had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods. If such an investor experiences losses, we will not be able to earn an incentive fee from such investor until it surpasses the previous high water mark. The incentive fees we earn are, therefore, dependent on the net asset value of investors' investments in the fund, which could lead to significant volatility in our results. Finally, the timing and amount of incentive fees generated by our closed-end funds are uncertain and will contribute to\nthe volatility of our net income. Incentive fees depend on our closed-end funds' investment performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited.\nBecause a portion of our revenue, net income and cash flow can be variable from quarter to quarter and year to year, we do not plan to provide any guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual operating results. The lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in the price of our common units.\nWe may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. We make investment decisions on behalf of investors in our funds that could result in substantial losses. This may subject us to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, we may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over portfolio investments. In addition, we and our affiliates that are the investment managers and general partners of our funds, our funds themselves and those of our employees who are our, our subsidiaries' or the funds' officers and directors are each exposed to the risks of litigation specific to the funds' investment activities and portfolio companies and, in the case where our funds own controlling interests in public companies, to the risk of shareholder litigation by the public companies' other shareholders. Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators relating to our having engaged, or our funds having engaged, in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.\nLegal liability could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our businesses. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our businesses.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals, especially our senior professionals. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our investment management business and our authority over the assets managed by our investment management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees could adversely affect investors in our funds and us. Our businesses often require that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which our funds may invest. If our employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our businesses and our reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact our ability to raise future funds.\nFraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our portfolio companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our businesses.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commission have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the FCPA. In addition, the United Kingdom has recently significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery law, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the \"UK Bribery Act\"). The UK Bribery Act prohibits companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom and their employees and representatives from giving, offering or promising bribes to any person, including non-UK government officials, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting bribes from any person. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies may be held liable for failing to prevent their employees and associated persons from violating the UK Bribery Act. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA and UK Bribery Act, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our common units.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies in which our funds invest. For example, failures by personnel at our portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions or other legal and regulatory requirements could expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Such misconduct could negatively affect the valuation of a fund's investments and consequently affect our funds' performance and negatively impact our businesses.\nOur use of leverage to finance our businesses exposes us to substantial risks.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had no amounts drawn under our Credit Facility and $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We may choose to finance our businesses operations through further borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our existing and future indebtedness exposes us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage, including those discussed below under \"-Risks Related to Our Funds-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\" The occurrence of any of these risks could cause us to suffer a decline in the credit ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies, which would cause the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility to increase and could result in other material adverse effects on our businesses. We depend on financial institutions extending credit to us on terms that are reasonable to us. There is no guarantee that such institutions will continue to extend credit to us or renew any existing credit agreements we may have with them, or that we will be able to refinance outstanding facilities when they mature.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility will mature in April 2019 and the senior notes mature in October 2024. As these borrowings and other indebtedness mature (or are otherwise repaid prior to their scheduled maturities), we may be required to either refinance them by entering into new facilities or issuing additional debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing equity, which would dilute existing common unitholders. We could also repay these borrowings by using cash on hand, cash provided by our continuing operations or cash from the sale of our assets, which could reduce distributions to our common unitholders. We may be unable to enter into new facilities or issue debt or equity in the future on attractive terms, or at all. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be LIBOR-based obligations. As a result, an increase in short-term interest rates will increase our interest costs if such borrowings have not been hedged into fixed rates.\nThe risks related to our use of leverage may be exacerbated by our funds' use of leverage to finance investments. See \"Risks Related to Our Funds-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of returns on those investments.\"\nOperational risks, including cyber security risks, may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. We also face operational risk from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds. In particular, our Tradable Credit Group, and to a lesser extent our Private Equity Group, is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. New investment products we may introduce could create a significant risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to identify or control the relevant risks in the investment strategies employed by such new investment products.\nWe face various security threats, including cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties outside of Ares. Although we have not yet been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of our network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nIn addition, we operate in a business that is highly dependent on information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, particularly our growth internationally, and the cost of maintaining the systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to the information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we depend on our headquarters in Los Angeles, where a substantial portion of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our businesses. An earthquake or other disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption. Although we have disaster recovery programs in place, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nFinally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our businesses, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our funds' operations and could impact our reputation, adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow.\nRisks Related to Our Funds\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units.\nThe historical performance of our funds is relevant to us primarily insofar as it is indicative of performance fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future and our reputation and ability to raise new funds. The historical and potential returns of the funds we advise are not, however, directly linked to returns on our common units. Therefore, holders of our common units should not conclude that positive performance of the funds we advise will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in common units. However, poor performance of the funds we advise would likely cause a decline in our revenues and would therefore likely have a negative effect on our operating results and returns on our common units. An investment in our common units is not an investment in any of our funds. Also, there is no assurance that projections in respect of our funds or unrealized valuations will be realized.\nMoreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these or from any future funds we may raise, in part because:\n\u2022 market conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions we may experience in the future;\n\u2022 our funds' rates of returns, which are calculated on the basis of net asset value of the funds' investments, reflect unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022 our funds' returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, including the availability of debt capital on attractive terms and the availability of distressed debt opportunities, and we may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u2022 the historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed, which may have little or no realized investment track record;\n\u2022 our funds' historical investments were made over a long period of time and over the course of various market and macroeconomic cycles, and the circumstances under which our current or future funds may make future investments may differ significantly from those conditions prevailing in the past;\n\u2022 the attractive returns of certain of our funds have been driven by the rapid return of invested capital, which has not occurred with respect to all of our funds and we believe is less likely to occur in the future;\n\u2022 investors in our common units will not benefit from any value that was created in our funds prior to our becoming a public company if such value was previously realized;\n\u2022 in recent years, there has been increased competition for private equity investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future;\n\u2022 our track record with respect to our Real Estate debt funds is relatively short as compared to our other funds; and\n\u2022 our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests. In addition, future returns will be affected by the applicable risks described elsewhere in this report, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets can be subject to significant subjectivity, and the values of assets may never be realized.\nMany of the investments in our funds are illiquid and thus have no readily ascertainable market prices. We value these investments based on our estimate, or an independent third party's estimate, of their fair value as of the date of determination. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and in many cases fair value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived. We estimate the fair value of our investments based on third-party models, or models developed by us, which include discounted cash flow analyses and other techniques and may be based, at least in part, on independently sourced market parameters. The material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows, the appropriateness of discount rates used, and, in some cases, the ability to execute, the timing of and the estimated proceeds from expected financings. The actual results related to any particular investment often vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of these estimates and assumptions. In addition, because many of the illiquid investments held by our funds are in industries or sectors which are unstable, in distress or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments.\nWe include the fair value of illiquid assets in the calculations of net asset values, returns of our funds and our assets under management. Furthermore, we recognize performance fees from affiliates based in part on these estimated fair values. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate greatly from period to period. Also, they may vary greatly from the prices that would be obtained if the assets were to be liquidated on the date of the valuation and often do vary greatly from the prices we eventually realize; as a result, there can be no assurance that such unrealized valuations will be fully or timely realized.\nIn addition, the values of our investments in publicly traded assets are subject to significant volatility, including due to a number of factors beyond our control. These include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of these companies or other companies in their industries, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions or government regulations, changes in management or capital structure and significant acquisitions and dispositions. Because the market prices of these securities can be volatile, the valuation of these assets will change from period to period, and the valuation for any particular period may not be realized at the time of disposition. In addition, because our funds often hold large positions in their portfolio companies, the disposition of these securities often takes place over a long period of time, which can further expose us to volatility risk. Even if we hold a quantity of public securities that may be difficult to sell in a single transaction, we do not discount the market price of the security for purposes of our valuations.\nAlthough we frequently engage independent third parties to perform the foregoing valuations, the valuation process remains inherently subjective for the reasons described above.\nIf we realize value on an investment that is significantly lower than the value at which it was reflected in a fund's net asset values, we would suffer losses in the applicable fund. This could in turn lead to a decline in asset management fees and a loss equal to the portion of the performance fees from affiliates reported in prior periods that was not realized upon disposition. These effects could become applicable to\na large number of our investments if our estimates and assumptions used in estimating their fair values differ from future valuations due to market developments. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Segment Analysis\" for information related to fund activity that is no longer consolidated. If asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values, fund investors could lose confidence which could, in turn, result in difficulties in raising additional investments.\nMarket values of debt instruments and publicly traded securities that our funds hold as investments may be volatile.\nThe market prices of debt instruments and publicly traded securities held by some of our funds may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control, including actual or anticipated changes in the profitability of the issuers of such securities, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts, inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, financings, refinancings, securities issuances, acquisitions and dispositions. The value of publicly traded securities in which our funds invest may be particularly volatile as a result of these factors. In addition, debt instruments that are held by our funds to maturity or for long terms must be \"marked-to-market\" periodically, and their values are therefore vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and the changes in the general state of the credit environment, notwithstanding their underlying performance. Changes in the values of these investments may adversely affect our investment performance and our results of operations.\nOur funds depend on investment cycles, and any change in such cycles could have an adverse effect on our investment prospects.\nCyclicality is important to our businesses. Weak economic environments have tended to afford us our best investment opportunities and our best relative investment performance. For example, the relative performance of our high yield bond strategy has typically been strongest in difficult times when default rates are highest, and our distressed debt and control investing funds have historically found their best investment opportunities during downturns in the economy when credit is not as readily available. Conversely, we tend to realize value from our investments in times of economic expansion, when opportunities to sell investments may be greater. Thus, we depend on the cyclicality of the market to sustain our businesses and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over extended periods. Any prolonged economic expansion or recession could have an adverse impact on certain of our funds and materially affect our ability to deliver attractive investment returns or generate incentive or other income.\nDependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nSome of our funds and their investments rely on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. If our funds or the companies in which our funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could adversely affect the financial resources of our funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real estate assets transactions.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate investments because other potential buyers, including operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of the asset. In addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance investments often includes high yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. Availability of capital from the high yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility, and there may be times when we are unable to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. Finally, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our funds' investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes, subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, as has been discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our businesses and financial results. See \"-Our funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States.\"\nIn the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could reduce the performance and investment income earned by us. Similarly, our funds' portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain financing for their operations. If the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In addition, if the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWhen our funds' existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have not generated sufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. A persistence of the limited availability of financing for such purposes for an extended period of time when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our funds' existing portfolio investments becomes due could have a material adverse effect on these funds.\nOur direct lending and tradable credit funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund's net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund's net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. In addition, as a business development\ncompany registered under the Investment Company Act, ARCC is permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. ARCC's ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least 200% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed private equity investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of a portfolio company's or real estate asset's total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of a portfolio company's capitalization. Additionally, the debt positions acquired by our funds may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject us to the greatest risk of loss.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. Furthermore, the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022 subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from the investment;\n\u2022 allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of our fund's equity investment in it;\n\u2022 give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity's ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u2022 limit the entity's ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u2022 limit the entity's ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u2022 limit the entity's ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nAs a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, a number of investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009. Similarly, the leveraged nature of the investments of our real estate funds increases the risk that a decline in the fair value of the underlying real estate or tangible assets will result in their abandonment or foreclosure.\nMany of our funds invest in assets that are high risk, illiquid or subject to restrictions on transfer and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities ever or for a considerable period of time.\nMany of our funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Our funds generally cannot sell these securities publicly unless either their sale is registered under applicable securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available. Accordingly, our funds may be forced, under certain conditions, to sell securities at a loss. The ability of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of these investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets. For example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability of the portfolio company in which such investment is held to complete an initial public offering. Even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time. Moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, often entails our having representation on our funds' public portfolio company boards, our funds can effect such sales only during limited trading windows, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. As such, we may fail to realize any profits from our investments in the funds that hold these securities for a considerable period of time or at all, and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments.\nCertain of our funds utilize special situation and distressed debt investment strategies that involve significant risks.\nCertain of our funds in our Tradable Credit and Private Equity Groups invest in obligors and issuers with weak financial conditions, poor operating results, substantial financing needs, negative net worth and/or special competitive problems. These funds also invest in obligors and issuers that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. In such situations, it may be difficult to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of these obligors and issuers. Additionally, the fair values of such investments are subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and significant price volatility if they are publicly traded securities, and are subject to significant uncertainty in general if they are not publicly traded securities. Furthermore, some of our funds' distressed investments may not be widely traded or may have no recognized market. A fund's exposure to such investments may be substantial in relation to the market for those investments, and the assets are likely to be illiquid and difficult to sell or transfer. As a result, it may take a number of years for the market value of such investments to ultimately reflect their intrinsic value as perceived by us.\nA central feature of our distressed investment strategy is our ability to effectively anticipate the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as debt and/or equity offerings, restructurings, reorganizations, mergers, takeover offers and other transactions, that we believe will improve the condition of the business. Similarly, we perform significant analysis of the company's capital structure, operations, industry and ability to generate income, as well as market valuation of the company and its debt, and develop a strategy with respect to a particular distressed investment based on such analysis. In furtherance of that strategy our funds seek to identify the best position in the capital structure in which to invest. If the relevant corporate event that we anticipate is delayed, changed or never completed, or if our analysis or investment strategy is inaccurate, the market price and value of the applicable fund's investment could decline sharply.\nIn addition, these investments could subject a fund to certain potential additional liabilities that may exceed the value of its original investment. Under certain circumstances, payments or distributions on certain investments may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, a preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control of the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed, or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In the case where the investment\nin securities of troubled companies is made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in bankruptcy, our funds may become involved in substantial litigation.\nCertain of the funds or accounts we advise or manage are subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, and our businesses could be adversely affected if certain of our other funds or accounts fail to satisfy an exception under the \"plan assets\" regulation under ERISA.\nCertain of the funds and accounts we advise or manage are subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. For example, we currently manage some of our funds or accounts as \"plan assets\" under ERISA. With respect to these funds or accounts, this results in the application of the fiduciary responsibility standards of ERISA to investments made by such funds or accounts, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, and the possibility that certain transactions that we enter into, or may have entered into, on behalf of these funds or accounts, in the normal course of business, might constitute or result in, or have constituted or resulted in, non-exempt prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. A non-exempt prohibited transaction, in addition to imposing potential liability upon fiduciaries of an ERISA plan, may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the Code upon a \"party in interest\" (as defined in ERISA) or \"disqualified person\" (as defined in the Code) with whom we engaged in the transaction. Some of our other funds or accounts currently qualify as venture capital operating companies (\"VCOCs\") or rely on another exception under the \"plan assets\" regulation under ERISA and therefore are not subject to the fiduciary requirements of ERISA with respect to their assets. However, if these funds or accounts fail to satisfy the VCOC requirements for any reason, including as a result of an amendment of the relevant regulations by the U.S. Department of Labor, or another exception under the \"plan assets\" regulation under ERISA, such failure could materially interfere with our activities in relation to these funds or accounts or expose us to risks related to our failure to comply with the applicable requirements.\nOur funds may be liable for the underfunded pension liabilities of their portfolio companies.\nUnder ERISA, members of certain \"controlled groups\" of \"trades or businesses\" may be jointly and severally liable for contributions required under any member's tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and under certain other benefit plans. Similarly, if any member's tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan were to terminate, underfunding at termination would be the joint and several responsibility of all controlled group members, including members whose employees did not participate in the terminated plan. Similarly, joint and several liability may be imposed for certain pension plan related obligations in connection with the complete or partial withdrawal by an employer from a multiemployer pension plan. Depending on a number of factors, including the level of ownership held by our funds in a particular portfolio company, a fund may be considered to be a member of a portfolio company's \"controlled group\" for this purpose, and thus may be liable for the underfunded pension liabilities of such portfolio company.\nIn Sun Capital Partners III L.P. v. New England Teamster and Trucking Industry Pension Fund, the First Circuit Court of Appeal held that a fund was engaged in a \"trade or business\" with a portfolio company for purposes of the ERISA rules and was thus liable for underfunded pension liabilities. If this decision is applied generally to private equity investing, our funds could be exposed to liability for certain benefit plan contributions, a liability that could be significant if the portfolio company's pension plan is significantly underfunded.\nOur funds' performance, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest.\nOur performance and the performance of our funds are significantly impacted by the value of the companies in which our funds have invested. Our funds invest in companies in many different industries, each of which is subject to volatility based upon economic and market factors. The credit crisis between mid-2007 and the end of 2009 caused significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by our funds\nand the recent global economic recession had a significant impact in overall performance activity and the demands for many of the goods and services provided by portfolio companies of the funds we advise. Although the U.S. economy has registered five consecutive years of growth in real GDP, there remain many obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as high unemployment, global geopolitical events, risks of inflation or deflation and high debt levels, both public and private. These factors and other general economic trends are likely to affect the performance of portfolio companies in many industries and, in particular, industries that anticipated that the GDP in developed economies would quickly return to pre-crisis trend. The performance of our funds, and our performance, may be adversely affected if our fund portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends.\nThe performance of our investments with underlying exposure to the commodities markets is also subject to a high degree of business and market risk, as it is dependent upon prevailing prices of commodities such as oil, natural gas and coal. Prices for oil and natural gas, for example, are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as level of consumer product demand, the refining capacity of oil purchasers, weather conditions, government regulations, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, foreign supply of such commodities and overall economic conditions. It is common in making investments with underlying exposure to the commodities markets to deploy hedging strategies to protect against pricing fluctuations but such strategies may or may not protect our investments.\nIn respect of real estate, even though the U.S. residential real estate market has recently shown signs of stabilizing from a lengthy and deep downturn, various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and have an adverse effect on investment performance, including, but not limited to, rising mortgage interest rates, a low level of confidence in the economic recovery or the residential real estate market and high unemployment.\nThird-party investors in certain of our funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.\nInvestors in certain of our funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when we call capital from them for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby limiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in private equity, real estate assets and venture capital funds typically use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. A failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those funds.\nOur funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States.\nSome of our funds invest a portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the United States, including Europe and Asia, while certain of our funds invest\nsubstantially all of their assets in these types of securities, and we expect that international investments will increase as a proportion of certain of our funds' portfolios in the future. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, including risks relating to:\n\u2022 our funds' abilities to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars and other currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another;\n\u2022 controls on, and changes in controls on, foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital;\n\u2022 less developed or less efficient financial markets than exist in the United States, which may lead to price volatility and relative illiquidity;\n\u2022 the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation;\n\u2022 changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments;\n\u2022 differences in legal and regulatory environments, particularly with respect to bankruptcy and reorganization, less developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties and the protection of investors and less reliable judicial systems to enforce contracts and applicable law;\n\u2022 political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors;\n\u2022 less publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets;\n\u2022 reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms;\n\u2022 higher rates of inflation;\n\u2022 higher transaction costs;\n\u2022 difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u2022 fewer investor protections;\n\u2022 certain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our non-U.S. investments and repatriation of capital, potential political, economic or social instability, the possibility of nationalization or expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments; and\n\u2022 the imposition of non-U.S. taxes or withholding taxes on income and gains recognized with respect to such securities.\nWhile our funds will take these factors into consideration in making investment decisions, including when hedging positions, there can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to these risks will not adversely affect our funds that invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers. In addition, certain of these funds are managed outside the United States, which may increase the foregoing risks.\nMany of our funds make investments in companies that we do not control.\nInvestments by many of our funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. Such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer. In addition, our funds may seek to acquire minority equity interests more frequently and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority\ninvestment. Furthermore, while certain of our funds may make \"toe-hold\" distressed debt investments in a company with the intention of obtaining control, there is no assurance that a control position may be obtained and such fund may retain a minority investment. Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of the investments held by our funds could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty with regard to expense allocation may increase risk of harm.\nWhile we historically have and will continue to allocate the expenses of our funds in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund agreements and our expense allocation policy in effect from time to time, due to increased regulatory scrutiny of expense allocation policies in the private investment funds realm, there is no guarantee that our policies and practices will not be challenged by our supervising regulatory bodies. If our supervising regulators were to determine that we have improperly allocated such expenses, we could be subject to regulatory censure, litigation from our fund investors and/or reputational harm, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may need to pay \"clawback\" obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our funds.\nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and increasingly at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation is known as a \"clawback\" obligation. Due in part to our investment performance and the fact that our carried interest is generally determined on a liquidation basis, as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, if the funds were liquidated at their fair values at that date, there would have been no clawback obligation or liability. There can be no assurance that we will not incur a clawback obligation in the future. At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, had we assumed all existing investments were worthless, the net amount of carried interest subject to clawback would have been approximately $295.7 million, $346.4 million and $332.8 million, respectively. Although a clawback obligation is several to each person who received a distribution, and not a joint obligation, the governing agreements of our funds generally provide that, if a recipient does not fund his or her respective share, we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond the amount of carried interest we retained, although we generally will retain the right to pursue remedies against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We may need to use or reserve cash to repay such clawback obligations instead of using the cash for other purposes. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contingent Obligations,\" Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 11 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds on short notice.\nThe terms of our funds generally give either the manager of the fund or the fund itself the right to terminate our investment management agreement with the fund. However, insofar as we control the general partners of our funds that are limited partnerships, the risk of termination of investment\nmanagement agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. This risk is more significant for certain of our funds that have independent boards of directors.\nWith respect to our funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, each fund's investment management agreement must be approved annually by (a) such fund's board of directors or by the vote of a majority of such fund's stockholders and (b) the majority of the independent members of such fund's board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. The funds' investment management agreements can also be terminated by the majority of such fund's stockholders. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Currently, ARDC and ARMF, registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act, and ARCC, a registered investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act, are subject to these provisions of the Investment Company Act.\nIn addition, with respect to certain of our funds the investment periods may be suspended or the funds may be terminated if we were to experience a change of control (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or as otherwise set forth in the partnership agreements of our funds) without obtaining the required investor consent. We cannot be certain that any required consents for any such deemed assignments or change of control will be obtained. Termination of these agreements, or suspension of the investment period (or other consequence), would negatively affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThird-party investors in many our funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund and to terminate the investment period under certain circumstances. In addition, the investment management agreements related to our separately managed accounts may permit the investor to terminate our management of such accounts on short notice. These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.\nThe governing agreements of many of our funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or terminate the fund, including in certain cases without cause by a simple majority vote. Any such removal or dissolution could result in a cessation in management fees we would earn from such funds and/or a significant reduction in the expected amounts of performance fees or carried interest from those funds. Performance fees or carried interest could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of investments by a fund during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a \"clawback\" obligation. Finally, the applicable funds would cease to exist after completion of liquidation and winding-up.\nIn addition, the governing agreements of many of our funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, third-party investors in those funds have the right to terminate the investment period of the fund, including in certain cases without cause. Such an event could have a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow of such fund. The governing agreements of our funds may also provide that upon the occurrence of events, including in the event that certain \"key persons\" in our funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, investors in those funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period, including in certain cases by a simple majority vote in accordance with specified procedures. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our future fundraising efforts.\nWe currently manage a portion of investor assets through separately managed accounts whereby we earn management fees and performance fees or carried interest, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account mandates. The investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts on behalf of certain clients may in certain cases be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. In addition, the boards of\ndirectors of the investment management companies we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. ARCC's investment management agreement can be terminated by the majority of its stockholders upon 60 days' prior written notice. In the case of any such terminations, the management fees and performance fees or carried interest we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues.\nIn addition, if we were to experience a change of control (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or as otherwise set forth in the partnership agreements of our funds), continuation of the investment management agreements of our funds would be subject to investor consent. There can be no assurance that required consents will be obtained if a change of control occurs. In addition, with respect to our funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, each fund's investment management agreement must be approved annually (a) by such fund's board of directors or by a vote of the majority of such fund's stockholders and (b) by the independent members of such fund's board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. Termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the management fees and performance fees we earn from such funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA downturn in the global credit markets could adversely affect our CLO investments.\nAmong the sectors that have been particularly challenged by a downturn in the global credit markets are the CLO and leveraged finance markets. CLOs are subject to credit, liquidity, interest rate and other risks. In 2008 and through early 2009, liquidity in the credit markets was significantly reduced, resulting in an increase in credit spreads and a decline in ratings, performance and market values for leveraged loans. We have significant exposure to these markets through our investments in our CLO funds. CLOs invest on a leveraged basis in loans or securities that are themselves highly leveraged investments in the underlying collateral, which increases both the opportunity for higher returns as well as the magnitude of losses when compared to unlevered investments. As a result of such funds' leveraged position, CLOs and their investors are at greater risk of suffering losses. The CLO market in which we invest has experienced an increase in downgrades, defaults and declines in market value and defaults in respect of leveraged loans in their collateral. Many CLOs have failed in the past or may in the future fail one or more of their \"overcollateralization\" tests. The failure of one or more of these tests will result in reduced cash flows that may have been otherwise available for distribution to us. This would reduce the value of our investment. There can be no assurance that market conditions giving rise to these types of consequences will not once again occur, subsist or become more acute in the future.\nOur funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification is generally an objective of our funds, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any fund investments. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a fund if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. This lack of diversification may expose a fund to losses disproportionate to market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse price movements in the particular investments. If a fund holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such fund may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment partnership to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a fund's performance and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of our investments may fall short of our expectations and the expectations of the investors in our funds.\nBefore making investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to an investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity.\nOnce we have made an investment in a portfolio company, our funds generally establish the capital structure on the basis of financial projections prepared by the management of such portfolio company. These projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. General economic conditions, which are not predictable, along with other factors, may cause actual performance to fall short of the projections.\nAdditionally, we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities. Such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment if any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund's performance.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund's term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nOur real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate.\nInvestments in our real estate funds will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets. These risks include the following:\n\u2022 those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property;\n\u2022 general and local economic conditions;\n\u2022 changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for example, of overbuilding);\n\u2022 fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties;\n\u2022 the financial resources of tenants;\n\u2022 changes in building, environmental and other laws;\n\u2022 energy and supply shortages;\n\u2022 various uninsured or uninsurable risks;\n\u2022 liability for \"slip-and-fall\" and other accidents on properties held by our funds;\n\u2022 natural disasters;\n\u2022 changes in government regulations (such as rent control and tax laws);\n\u2022 changes in real property tax and transfer tax rates;\n\u2022 changes in interest rates;\n\u2022 the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable;\n\u2022 negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity;\n\u2022 environmental liabilities;\n\u2022 contingent liabilities on disposition of assets;\n\u2022 unexpected cost overruns in connection with development projects;\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 dependence on local operating partners.\nAlthough real estate values have generally rebounded with the rest of the economy, other than certain high profile assets in the best markets, prices in 2014 often remain below peaks reached in late 2007 or early 2008.\nIf our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms. Additionally, our funds' properties may be managed by a third party, which makes us dependent upon such third parties and subjects us to risks associated with the actions of such third parties. Any of these factors may cause the value of the investments in our real estate funds to decline, which may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nHedging strategies may adversely affect the returns on our funds' investments.\nWhen managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other strategies. Currency fluctuations in particular can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and financial condition. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market or foreign exchange changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into a transaction to reduce our exposure to market or foreign exchange risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. Finally, the CFTC has made several public statements that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nIf we were deemed to be an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nAn entity will generally be deemed to be an \"investment company\" for purposes of the Investment Company Act if:\n\u2022 it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n\u2022 absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nWe believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management services and not primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We hold ourselves out as an asset management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are an \"orthodox\" investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act and described in the first bullet point above. Furthermore, we have no material assets other than interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act), which in turn have no material assets other than partnership units in the Ares Operating Group entities. These wholly owned subsidiaries are the general partners of certain of the Ares Operating Group entities and are vested with all management and control over such Ares Operating Group entities. We do not believe that the equity interests of Ares Management, L.P. in its wholly owned subsidiaries or the partnership units of these wholly owned subsidiaries in the Ares Operating Group entities are investment securities. Moreover, because we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities, we believe that less than 40% of Ares Management, L.P.'s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are composed of assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that Ares Management, L.P. is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% test in section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act as described in the second bullet point above.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If anything were to happen that would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on capital structure, the ability to transact business with affiliates and the ability to compensate senior employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among the Ares Operating Group, us, our funds and our senior management, or any combination thereof, and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our businesses in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the Investment Company Act.\nOur common unitholders do not elect our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, vote on our general partner's directors and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses.\nOur general partner manages all of our operations and activities. For so long as, as determined on January 31 of each year, the total voting power held by holders of the special voting units in Ares Management, L.P. (including voting units held by our general partner, members of Ares Partners Holdco LLC and their respective affiliates) in their capacity as such, or otherwise directly or indirectly held by then-current or former Ares personnel and held by Ares Owners Holdings L.P., collectively, constitutes at least 10% of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of Ares Management, L.P. (treating as outstanding and held by such persons, voting units deliverable to such persons pursuant to outstanding equity awards granted to such persons), which we refer to as the \"Ares control condition,\" the board of directors of our general partner has no authority other than that which its member chooses to delegate to it. In the event that the Ares control condition is not satisfied, the board of directors of our general partner will be responsible for the oversight of our business and operations. See \"Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Limited Powers of Our Board of Directors.\"\nUnlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our common unitholders have limited voting rights and have no right to remove our general partner or, except in the limited circumstances described below, elect the directors of our general partner. Our common unitholders have no right to elect the directors of our general partner unless the Ares control condition is not satisfied. For so long as the Ares control condition is satisfied, our general partner's board of directors will be elected in accordance with its limited liability company agreement, which provides that directors may be appointed and removed by Ares Partners Holdco LLC, the member of our general partner. Ares Partners Holdco LLC is owned by our Co-Founders and managed by a board of managers, which is composed of our Co-Founders. Decisions by the board of managers generally are made by a majority of the Co-Founders, which majority, subject to a minimum ownership requirement, must include Antony P. Ressler. As a result, our common unitholders have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses.\nOur Co-Founders will be able to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders.\nAres Voting LLC, an entity wholly owned by Ares Partners Holdco LLC, which is in turn owned and controlled by our Co-Founders, holds a special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes, on any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders (voting together as a single class on all such matters), that is equal to the aggregate number of Ares Operating Group Units held by the limited partners of the Ares Operating Group entities that do not hold a special voting unit. Our Co-Founders, through Ares Owners Holdings L.P. and the special voting unit held by Ares Voting LLC, hold approximately 78% of the voting power of Ares Management, L.P.. Accordingly, our Co-Founders have sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders.\nOur common unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement that states that any common units held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of any class of our common units then outstanding (other than our general partner, Ares Owners Holdings L.P., a member of Ares Partners Holdco LLC or their respective affiliates, a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general partner or its affiliates or a person who acquired such common units with the prior approval of our general partner) cannot be voted on any matter. In addition, our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to call meetings or to acquire\ninformation about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to influence the manner or direction of our management. Our partnership agreement also does not restrict our general partner's ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. Furthermore, the common unitholders are not be entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal under our partnership agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event.\nAs a result of these matters and the provisions referred to under \"-Our common unitholders do not elect our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, vote on our general partner's directors and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses,\" our common unitholders may be deprived of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common units in the future through a sale of Ares Management, L.P., and the trading prices of our common units may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner, its affiliates or associates and us. Our general partner and its affiliates and associates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our common unitholders, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our common unitholders.\nConflicts of interest may arise among our general partner or its affiliates or associates, on the one hand, and us or our common unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates or associates (including the Co-Founders) over our interests or the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following:\n\u2022 our general partner determines the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions, indebtedness, issuances of additional partnership interests and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our common unitholders;\n\u2022 our general partner, in resolving conflicts of interest, is entitled to take into account only such factors as it determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances, which may include factors affecting parties other than us and our common unitholders (including the Co-Founders), which has the effect of limiting its duties (including fiduciary duties) to us and our common unitholders. For example, our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our funds have fiduciary and contractual obligations to the investors in those funds, as a result of which we expect to regularly take actions in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might adversely affect our results of operations or cash flow;\n\u2022 because our senior professional owners hold their Ares Operating Group Units through an entity that is not subject to corporate income taxation and Ares Management, L.P. holds Ares Operating Group Units directly or through direct subsidiaries, some of which are subject to corporate income taxation, conflicts may arise between our senior professional owners and Ares Management, L.P. relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other matters;\n\u2022 other than as set forth in the fair competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements to which our Co-Founders are subject, which may not be enforceable, affiliates of our general partner and existing and former personnel employed by our general partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us;\n\u2022 our general partner and its affiliates and associates have limited their liability and reduced or eliminated their duties (including fiduciary duties) under our partnership agreement, while also restricting the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duty). In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our general partner and its affiliates and associates (including the Co-Founders) to the\nfullest extent permitted by law, except with respect to conduct involving bad faith or criminal intent. By purchasing our common units, holders of our common units have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement, including the provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in the absence of such provisions, might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law;\n\u2022 our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements are agreed to by our general partner in good faith as determined under our partnership agreement;\n\u2022 our general partner determines how much we pay for acquisition targets and the structure of such consideration, including whether to incur debt to fund the transaction, whether to issue units as consideration and the number of units to be issued and the amount and timing of any earn-out payments;\n\u2022 the sole member of our general partner determines whether to allow senior professionals to exchange their units or waive certain restrictions relating to such units;\n\u2022 our general partner determines how much debt we incur and that decision may adversely affect our credit ratings;\n\u2022 our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;\n\u2022 our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates; and\n\u2022 our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.\nSee \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\"\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our general partner and its affiliates and associates and limit remedies available to common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty. It is difficult for a common unitholder to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our general partner or by its conflicts committee.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner or its affiliates or associates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that when our general partner is acting in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, it or any of its affiliates or associates causing it to do so may act without any duties (including fiduciary duties) or obligations to us or our common unitholders whatsoever. When our general partner, in its capacity as our general partner, is permitted to or required to make a decision in its \"sole discretion\" or \"discretion\" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude or pursuant to any provision not subject to an express standard of \"good faith,\" then our general partner is entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests or the interests of the Co-Founders, and has no duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any common unitholders and is not be subject to any different standards imposed by our partnership agreement, or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise. These provisions are expressly permitted by Delaware law. Unless our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement, we and our common unitholders do not have any recourse against our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties. Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of our partnership agreement, our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and its members, managers, officers and directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its members, managers, officers or directors acted in bad faith or with criminal intent. These modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty (including fiduciary duty).\nWhenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our partners and our general partner or its affiliates or associates, our general partner may resolve such conflict of interest in good faith. If our general partner subjectively believes that its resolution of the conflict of interest is not opposed to our best interests, then it will be conclusively deemed that its resolution was made in good faith and will not be a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty. A common unitholder seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of overcoming such presumption. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair.\nAlso, if our general partner obtains the approval of its conflicts committee or a majority of the voting units, the resolution will be conclusively deemed approved by us and our common unitholders and not a breach of our partnership agreement (or any agreement referred to therein) or of any duties that our general partner or its affiliates or associates may owe to us or our common unitholders. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent directors may, in certain circumstances, merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff. Common unitholders are treated as having consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement, including provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in the absence of such provisions, might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. As a result, common unitholders will, as a practical matter, not be able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee. See \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\"\nThe potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to International Financial Reporting Standards may strain our resources and increase our annual expenses.\nAs a public entity, the Commission may require in the future that we report our financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") instead of under GAAP. IFRS is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis. These standards are published by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than GAAP. Today, there remain significant and material differences in several key areas between GAAP and IFRS which would affect us. Additionally, GAAP provides specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in IFRS does not exist. The adoption of IFRS is highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects of us and our operations, including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems, internal controls, taxes, borrowing covenants and cash management. It is expected that a significant amount of time, internal and external resources and expenses over a multi-year period would be required for this conversion.\nThe consolidation of investment funds, holding companies or operating businesses of our portfolio companies could make it more difficult to understand our operating performance and could create operational risks for us.\nUnder applicable GAAP standards, we may be required to consolidate certain of our investment funds, holding companies or operating businesses if we determine that we have a direct and indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. As such, we consolidate (a) entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including Ares-affiliates and affiliated funds and co-investment entities, for which we are the general partner and are presumed to have control,\nand (b) entities that we concluded are VIEs, including limited partnerships in which we have a nominal economic interest and the CLOs, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidation of such entities could make it difficult for an investor to differentiate our assets, liabilities, and results of operations apart from the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Consolidated Funds. The assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our liquidity requirements and similarly we generally have not guaranteed or assumed any obligation for repayment of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. For example, under current GAAP standards, we generally are required to consolidate onto our financial statements the CLOs that we manage. As of December 31, 2014, we consolidated the financial positions and results of operations of 66 Consolidated Funds, including 31 CLOs, into our consolidated financial statements. The total assets and total liabilities included in our consolidated financial statements were approximately $20.8 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.\nThe VIEs that we consolidate will be, subject to certain transition guidelines, included in our annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we will need to implement and oversee procedures and processes to integrate such operations into our internal control structure. If we are not able to implement or maintain the necessary procedures and processes, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely or accurate basis and thereby could subject us to adverse consequences, including sanctions by the Commission or violations of New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") rules, and could result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements.\nThe requirements of being a public entity and sustaining growth may strain our resources.\nAs a public entity, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, which is discussed below. See \"-Our internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our common units.\"\nSection 404 requires our management and independent auditors to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, we are an emerging growth company and, so for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nTo maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, significant resources and management oversight is required. We have implemented additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining our growth also requires us to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur significant additional annual expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the Commission, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing, tax and legal fees and similar expenses.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our common units.\nWhile we are familiar with the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with our support of our publicly traded vehicles, we have not previously been required to comply with all of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 that will be applicable to us, and we will not be required to comply with all of those requirements until we have been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for a specified period of time. Accordingly, the documentation of our internal controls over financial reporting has not been completed and the related control design and operating effectiveness have not been assessed for Ares as a whole. We are in the process of addressing our internal controls over financial reporting and are identifying key financial reporting risks, assessing their potential impact and linking those risks to specific areas and activities within our organization.\nAdditionally, we have begun the process of documenting and assessing the design of our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. The aforementioned management assessment requirement is not required until our second annual report as a public entity and the auditor attestation requirements will not apply to us until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" As a public entity, we are required to complete our initial assessment in a timely manner. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our operations, financial reporting or financial results could be adversely affected, and, when we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide a certification as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the Commission or violations of applicable NYSE listing rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer if our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could have a material adverse effect on us and lead to a decline in the price of our common units. In addition, we will incur incremental costs to formalize our internal control over financial reporting and comply with Section 404, including increased auditing and legal fees and costs associated with hiring additional accounting and administrative staff.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common units may be less attractive to investors.\nAs an emerging growth company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, a provision allowing us to present only two years of audited financial statements, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute\narrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements and the exemption from the auditor attestation requirement available to emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We cannot predict if investors will find our common units less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common units less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common units and the price of our common units may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have determined to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not \"emerging growth companies.\" Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable.\nThe control of our general partner may be transferred without common unitholder consent.\nOur general partner may transfer all or any part of its general partner interest without the consent of our common unitholders. Furthermore, at any time, the member of our general partner may sell or transfer all or part of its interests in our general partner without the approval of the common unitholders. A new general partner may not be willing or able to form new funds and could form funds that have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current funds. A new owner could also have a different investment philosophy, employ investment professionals who are less experienced, be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as our track record. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our businesses, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.\nOur ability to pay regular distributions to our common unitholders may be limited by our holding partnership structure, applicable provisions of Delaware law and contractual restrictions or obligations.\nAs a holding partnership, our ability to pay distributions will be subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to us. Ares Management, L.P. has no material assets other than investments in the Ares Operating Group entities, either directly or through direct subsidiaries. We have no independent means of generating revenues. Accordingly, we intend to cause the Ares Operating Group entities to make distributions to their members and partners, including Ares Management, L.P.'s direct subsidiaries, to fund any distributions Ares Management, L.P. may declare on the common units. If the Ares Operating Group entities make such distributions, all holders of Ares Operating Group Units will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in the Ares Operating Group. Because the direct subsidiaries of Ares Management, L.P. that are taxable as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes are subject to entity-level income taxes and may be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the amounts ultimately distributed by Ares Management, L.P. to common unitholders are generally expected to be less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Ares Operating Group to the holders of Ares Operating Group Units in respect of their Ares Operating Group Units.\nThe declaration and payment of any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. There can be no assurance that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, can or will be paid. Our ability to make cash distributions to\nour common unitholders depends on a number of factors, including among other things, general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us, payments required pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.\nUnder the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the \"Delaware Limited Partnership Act\"), we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership, would exceed the fair value of our assets. If we were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility or other financing arrangements may from time to time include covenants or other restrictions that could constrain our ability to make distributions. In addition, the Ares Operating Group's cash flow may be insufficient to enable them to make required minimum tax distributions to their members and partners, in which case the Ares Operating Group may have to borrow funds or sell assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Our partnership agreement contains provisions authorizing us to issue additional partnership interests that have designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to our common units on the terms and conditions determined by our general partner in its sole discretion at any time without common unitholder approval.\nFurthermore, by making cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise.\nWe will be required to pay the TRA Recipients for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in subsequent sales or exchanges of Ares Operating Group Units and related transactions. In certain circumstances, payments to the TRA Recipients may be accelerated and/or could significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.\nThe holders of Ares Operating Group Units, subject to any applicable transfer restrictions and other provisions, may, on a quarterly basis, from and after May 7, 2016 (the second anniversary of the date of the closing of our initial public offering) (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their Ares Operating Group Units for our common units on a one-for-one basis (provided that Alleghany may exchange up to half of its Ares Operating Group Units from and after the first anniversary of our initial public offering) or, at our option, for cash. A holder of Ares Operating Group Units must exchange one Ares Operating Group Unit in each of the five Ares Operating Group entities to effect an exchange for a common unit of Ares Management, L.P. Subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the relevant Ares Operating Group entity. These increases in tax basis generally will increase (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and potentially reduce gain on sales of assets and, therefore, reduce the amount of tax that Ares Management, L.P.'s direct subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations for U.S. federal tax purposes, which we refer to as the \"corporate taxpayers,\" would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of these deductions and tax basis increases, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the TRA Recipients that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to the TRA Recipients of 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers\nactually realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change of control, as discussed below) as a result of increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. The payments our corporate taxpayers may make to the TRA Recipients could be material in amount and we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement if our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. Assuming that the market value of a common unit were to be equal to $17.14 per common unit, which is the closing price per common unit as of December 31, 2014, and that LIBOR were to be 1.25%, we estimate that the aggregate amount of these termination payments would be approximately $536.0 million. The foregoing amount is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially.\nIf the IRS were to challenge a tax basis increase, certain direct and indirect holders of AOG Units (the \"TRA Recipients\") will not reimburse us for any payments previously made to them under the tax receivable agreement. The corporate taxpayers' ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments to the TRA Recipients under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate taxpayers' cash tax savings.\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a change of control, or if, at any time, the corporate taxpayers elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, the corporate taxpayers' obligations under the tax receivables agreement with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayers would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and, in the case of an early termination election, that any Ares Operating Group Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination. See \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Tax Receivable Agreement.\"\nTax consequences to the direct and indirect holders of Ares Operating Group Units may give rise to conflicts of interests.\nAs a result of the tax gain inherent in our assets held by the Ares Operating Group at the time of this report, upon a realization event, the direct and indirect holders of Ares Operating Group Units may incur different and potentially significantly greater tax liabilities as a result of the disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain to such holders. As these direct and indirect holders will not receive a corresponding greater distribution of cash proceeds, they may, subject to applicable fiduciary or contractual duties, have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing, timing and other material terms of any sale, refinancing, or disposition, or whether to sell such assets at all. Decisions made with respect to an acceleration or deferral of income or the sale or disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains may also influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the TRA Recipients (including, among others, our Co-Founders and other executive officers) under the tax receivable agreement. In general, we anticipate that earlier disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains following such exchange will tend to accelerate such payments and increase the present value of the tax receivable agreement, and disposition of assets with unrealized built-in tax gains before an exchange generally will increase an exchanging holder's tax liability without giving rise to any rights to any payments under the tax receivable agreement. Decisions made regarding a change of control also could have a material influence on the timing and amount of payments received by the TRA Recipients pursuant to the tax receivable agreement.\nWe are a limited partnership and as a result will qualify for and intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the NYSE.\nWe are a limited partnership and qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the NYSE. Pursuant to these exceptions, limited partnerships may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirements (i) that a majority of the board of directors of our general partner consist of independent directors, (ii) that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, (iii) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, and (iv) that the compensation committee consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. In addition, we are not required to hold annual meetings of our common unitholders. We have availed ourselves of these exceptions. Accordingly, holders of our common units do not have the same protections afforded to equityholders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nWe are a Delaware limited partnership, and there are certain provisions in our partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders.\nOur partnership agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the directors and officers of our general partner will not be liable to us unless they act in bad faith or with criminal intent. However, under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director or officer would be liable to us for (i) breach of duty of loyalty to us or our equityholders, (ii) intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith, (iii) improper redemption of units or declaration of dividend, or (iv) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our partnership agreement provides that we indemnify the directors and officers of our general partner for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law unless they act in bad faith or with criminal intent. However, under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and, in criminal action, if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, our partnership agreement is less protective of the interests of our common unitholders, when compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law, insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of officers and directors.\nOwnership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our common unitholders might receive a premium for their common units.\nFor Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC to qualify as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2014, among other requirements, no more than 50% in value of its outstanding limited liability company interests may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year. \"Individuals\" for this purpose includes natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts and some charitable trusts. To preserve Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's REIT qualification, which we believe confers certain tax benefits to us and our common unitholders, including reducing the state income tax filing requirements of our common unitholders while minimizing to the extent possible the imposition of corporate-level taxes, our partnership agreement generally prohibits any person (except for existing owners who would otherwise exceed the ownership limit who we expect to be subject to an excepted holder limit) from beneficially or constructively owning, applying certain attribution rules under the Code, more than the lesser of 7.5% of the number of all outstanding common units and the value of all outstanding units. This ownership limitation could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common units might receive a premium for their common units over the then prevailing market price or which unitholders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.\nRisks Related to Our Common Units\nThe market price and trading volume of our common units may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our common unitholders.\nThe market price of our common units may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common units may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common units declines significantly, holders of our common units may be unable to resell their common units at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common units may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common units or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common units include:\n\u2022 variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions, which variations we expect will be substantial;\n\u2022 our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns;\n\u2022 failure to meet analysts' earnings estimates;\n\u2022 publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units;\n\u2022 additions or departures of our senior professionals and other key management personnel;\n\u2022 adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022 changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022 a lack of liquidity in the trading of our common units;\n\u2022 announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 adverse publicity about the asset management industry generally or, more specifically, private equity fund practices or individual scandals; and\n\u2022 general market and economic conditions.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against public companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nThe tax attributes of our common units may cause mutual funds to limit or reduce their holdings of common units.\nU.S. mutual funds that are treated as regulated investment companies (\"RICs\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of their investment company taxable income to their shareholders to maintain their favorable U.S. income tax status. RICs generally are required to meet this distribution requirement regardless of whether their investments generate cash distributions equal to their taxable income. Accordingly, these investors have a strong incentive to invest in securities in which the amount of cash generated is at least equal to the\namount of taxable income recognized. Our common unitholders, however, may be allocated an amount of income and gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes that exceeds the amount of cash we distribute to them. Additionally, for non-U.S. investors in RICs, certain complex rules may limit the benefits of investing in a RIC to the extent that such RIC's holdings include our common units. This may make it difficult for RICs to maintain a meaningful portion of their portfolio in our common units and may force those RICs that do hold our common units to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common units. These actions could increase the supply of, and reduce the demand for, our common units, which could cause the price of our common units to decline.\nAn investment in our common units is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.\nCommon unitholders will not directly participate in the performance of our underlying funds, and any benefits from such performance will directly inure to investors in those funds. Our common units are securities of Ares Management, L.P. only. While our historical consolidated financial information includes financial information, including assets and revenues, of our funds on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund and not to us except to a limited extent through management fees, performance fees, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.\nThe market price of our common units may decline due to the large number of common units eligible for exchange and future sale.\nThe market price of our common units could decline as a result of sales of a large number of common units in the market in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Subject to the lock-up restrictions described below, we may issue and sell in the future additional common units.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our senior professional owners owned, indirectly, an aggregate of 118,358,662 Ares Operating Group Units. We have entered into an exchange agreement with the holders of Ares Operating Group Units so that such holders, subject to any applicable transfer and other restrictions, may up to four times each year from and after the second anniversary of the date of our initial public offering (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Ares Operating Group Units for our common units on a one-for-one basis (provided that Alleghany may exchange up to half of its Ares Operating Group Units from and after the first anniversary of our initial public offering), subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications, or, at our option, for cash. A holder of Ares Operating Group Units must exchange one Ares Operating Group Unit in each of the five Ares Operating Group entities to effect an exchange for a common unit of Ares Management, L.P. The common units we issue upon such exchanges would be \"restricted securities,\" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless we register such issuances.\nAres Owners Holdings L.P., ADIA and Alleghany (together with ADIA, the \"Strategic Investors\") have the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us to register under the Securities Act common units delivered in exchange for Ares Operating Group Units or common units of Ares Management, L.P. otherwise held by them. In addition, we may be required to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of common units into the market from time to time over an extended period. Lastly, Ares Owners Holdings L.P. and the Strategic Investors will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in respect of common units held by them in connection with registered offerings requested by other registration rights holders or initiated by us. See \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Investor Rights Agreement.\" In addition, the common units received by our award recipients in connection with our initial public offering\nare not vested and are subject to transfer restrictions for five years following our initial public offering. See \"Item 11. Executive Compensation-Director Compensation-Common Units and Ares Operating Group Units.\" However, transfers may occur notwithstanding such restrictions pursuant to transactions or programs approved by our general partner.\nUnder our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, we granted options to purchase 24,835,227 common units and 4,936,051 restricted units to be settled in common units, which are subject to specified vesting requirements, to certain of our senior professionals. During the course of 2014, awards representing 764,707 common units were forfeited and became available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2014, 2,697,974 additional common units were available for award under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the terms of our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, an additional 29,030,975 common units became available for award under such plan on January 1, 2015, increasing the number of common units available for award under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to 31,728,949. We have filed one registration statement and intend to file more registration statements on Form S-8 with the Commission covering the common units issuable under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to vesting and contractual lock-up arrangements, upon effectiveness of the relevant registration statement on Form S-8, such common units are freely tradable.\nIn addition, our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by our general partner in its sole discretion without the approval of any limited partners. In accordance with the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may also issue additional partnership interests that have certain designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to common units. Similarly, the governing agreements of the Ares Operating Group entities authorize the direct subsidiaries of Ares Management, L.P. which are the general partners of those entities to issue an unlimited number of additional units of the Ares Operating Group entity with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the Ares Operating Group Units, and which may be exchangeable for our common units.\nWe cannot assure holders of our common units that our intended distributions will be paid each quarter or at all.\nOur intention is to distribute to our common unitholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of Ares Management, L.P.'s share of distributable earnings, net of applicable corporate taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement, in excess of amounts determined by our general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our businesses, to make appropriate investments in our businesses and our funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements or to provide for future distributions to our common unitholders for any ensuing quarter, subject to a base quarterly distribution in a target range of 80% to 90% of distributable earnings. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of quarterly distributions, if any, will be at the sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. We cannot assure our common unitholders that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, can or will be paid. In making decisions regarding our quarterly distribution, our general partner considers general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax, regulatory and other restrictions that may have implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.\nRisks Related to U.S. Taxation\nThe U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would subject us to U.S. federal income tax as a corporation on our net income which would materially increase our U.S. federal income tax liability, could materially reduce the amount available for distribution to common unitholders and would materially alter the tax considerations in connection with an investment in, the ownership of and the disposition of our common units.\nOn several occasions in recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislative proposals that, if enacted, would repeal the exception from taxation as a corporation currently available to certain publicly traded partnerships. Legislation was introduced in the last Congress that, if enacted in the form proposed, would cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and subject us to U.S. corporate income tax on our net corporate taxable income. Enactment of any such legislation likely would materially increase our entity-level tax liability, and therefore reduce amounts otherwise available for us to distribute to common unitholders. In addition, if we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, ownership of our common units would have the same U.S. federal income tax considerations as ownership of common stock of a corporation. As a result, any such proposal that was ultimately enacted into law would materially alter the U.S. federal income tax considerations in connection with an investment in, the ownership of and the disposition of our common units. As of the date of this report, it is not possible to predict if, whether or when any proposal previously introduced, or a similar proposal, might be enacted, in what form or with what effective date. Investors should discuss with their own tax advisors the possibility that we might cease to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other possible changes in tax law.\nOver the past several years, there have been legislative proposals that, if enacted, would tax certain common unitholders with respect to certain of our income and gains at increased rates. If such legislation, or similar legislation, were to be enacted, a substantial portion of our income, as well as gain from the disposition of common units, could be taxed at a higher rate to certain common unitholders.\nOver the past several years, there have been proposals by both Congress and the executive branch, as well as from states and other jurisdictions, that, if enacted, generally would cause, among other things, some or all of a partner's share of certain partnership income and certain income realized upon a disposition of partnership interests, that, in each case, otherwise would be treated as long-term capital gains for U.S. federal income tax purposes to be recharacterized as ordinary income, and therefore potentially subject to a higher rate of U.S. federal income tax (or higher state or local tax rates). It is unclear when or whether Congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any legislation, if enacted.\nSome legislative and administrative proposals have provided that, for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment (or, in some cases, beginning ten years after the date of enactment), income derived with respect to carried interest would not meet the qualifying income requirements under publicly traded partnership rules. Therefore, if similar legislation is enacted, following such enactment (or such ten-year period), we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we were taxed as a U.S. corporation, our effective tax rate would increase significantly. The federal statutory tax rate for corporations is currently 35%. In addition, we could be subject to increased state and local taxes. Furthermore, common unitholders could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation. Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, has also identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for the next Congress. As of the date of this report, it is not possible to predict whether or when any proposal previously introduced, or a similar proposal, might be enacted, in what form or with what effective date. If such proposals, or similar proposals, were to be enacted, the tax liability of certain of our common unitholders could increase significantly and our ability to fund cash distributions could be reduced.\nAdditional proposed changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\nCongress, the OECD and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational entities. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, the Obama administration has announced proposals for potential reform to the U.S. federal income tax rules for businesses, including reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations, anti-inversion rules, reducing the top marginal rate on corporations and subjecting entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes to an entity-level income tax similar to the corporate income tax. Several of these proposals for reform, if enacted by the United States or by other countries in which we or our affiliates invest or do business, could adversely affect our investment returns. Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, has also identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for the next Congress. Whether these or other proposals will be enacted by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of any such proposed legislation.\nOur structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of our common unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Additionally, changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to satisfy the requirements for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation, affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our common units. Additionally, our organizational documents and governing agreements permit our general partner to modify our partnership agreement from time to time, without the consent of our common unitholders, to address certain changes in U.S. federal income tax regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all of our common unitholders.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax or state tax purposes, then the amount available for distribution to our common unitholders would be substantially reduced and the value of our common units would be adversely affected.\nAn entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be treated as, and taxable as, a corporation if it is a \"publicly traded partnership\" unless an exception to such treatment applies. An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if interests in the entity are traded on an established securities market or interests in the entity are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and we believe we are publicly traded for this purpose. However, a publicly traded partnership can avoid being treated as a corporation by satisfying the \"Qualifying Income Exception,\" which requires at least 90% of such entity's gross income (determined under specific tax rules) for every taxable year that it is a publicly traded partnership consist of qualifying income (which generally includes certain interest income, dividends, real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, and gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income), and the entity must not be required to register under the Investment Advisers Act. We intend to manage our affairs so that we will meet the Qualifying Income Exception in\nand each succeeding taxable year to be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf we failed to meet the requirements described above and, as a result, we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on our U.S. taxable income at regular corporate rates and our cash available for distribution would be reduced. Accordingly, our being treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes could materially reduce our common unitholders' after-tax return and thus could substantially reduce the value of the common units.\nOur common unitholders will be required to take into account their allocable share of our taxable income and gain, regardless of whether they receive any cash distributions from us.\nAs long as we are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, our common unitholders will be required to take into account their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit on an annual basis in calculating their U.S. federal income taxable income.\nAs a result, our common unitholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including our allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending with or within their taxable years, regardless of whether or not our common unitholders receive cash distributions from us. Additionally, our common unitholders may not receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of our net taxable income or gain, or even the amount of their U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability that results from that income or gain. Also, certain of our holdings, such as stock in a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company or an entity that is fiscally transparent or a financial conduit for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income, and common unitholders that are U.S. taxpayers generally will be required to take such income into account in determining their U.S. federal taxable income. In the event of an inadvertent termination of our partnership status, and provided that the IRS were to grant to us limited relief available under statute, each holder of our common units would be obligated to make adjustments as required by the IRS to maintain our status as a partnership. In such a circumstance, such adjustments may require persons holding our common units to recognize additional amounts of taxable income in respect of the taxable years to which such allocations applied.\nCommon unitholders will be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning our common units.\nIn addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our common unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes, that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if our common unitholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Our common unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns in some or all of these jurisdictions and may be required to pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, common unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state and local tax returns that may be required of such common unitholder.\nCertain of our businesses are held through entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will reduce the amount available for distributions to holders of our common units in respect of such investments and could adversely affect the value of our common unitholders' investment.\nTo comply with the publicly traded partnership rules under U.S. federal income tax law and other requirements, we hold our interest in certain of our businesses through AHI, Ares Domestic Holdings Inc., Ares Offshore Holdings Ltd. and Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC, which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may hold additional interests in other businesses through other entities treated as corporations. Such corporations could be liable for significant U.S. federal income taxes and applicable state and local taxes that would not otherwise be incurred, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to holders of our common units and adversely affect the value of their investment. However, we intend for Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \"-Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local taxes, and would adversely affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders.\"\nAres Real Estate Holdings LLC's failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local taxes, and would adversely affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders.\nWe intend for one of our direct subsidiaries, Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC, to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2014. Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's qualification as a REIT depends upon its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. We intend to structure the activities of Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC in a manner designed to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT.\nHowever, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and administrative and judicial interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC will be successful in operating so it can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on an analysis of the characterization and fair market values of Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which it will not obtain independent appraisals. Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on its ability to successfully manage the composition of its income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of its operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization could jeopardize its ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in its disqualification as a REIT. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC qualifies as a REIT. Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC may terminate its REIT status if the general partner of Ares Management, L.P. determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC and Ares Management, L.P., or as a result of failure to comply with the REIT qualification requirements that is not cured.\nIf Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC fails to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and it does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing its REIT qualification. Losing Ares Real Estate Holdings LLC's REIT qualification could reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to common unitholders.\nTax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.\nIf our common unitholders sell their common units, they will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their adjusted tax basis in those common units. Prior distributions to our common unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to them, which decreased the tax basis in their common units, will in effect become taxable income or gain to the holders of our common units if the common units are sold at a price greater than the unitholder's tax basis in those common units, even if the price is less than the original cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income to the common unitholder.\nOur common units may not be uniform, which could result in IRS examination of our tax returns and the tax returns of our common unitholders, and could have a negative impact on the value of our common unitholder's investment.\nWe cannot match transferors and transferees of our common units, and as a result we will adopt depreciation, amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our common unitholders, and could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of our common units. This could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our U.S. federal tax returns and the tax returns of our common unitholders.\nIn addition, our taxable income and losses will be determined and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law. As a result, if our common unitholders transfer their common units, they may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer. Similarly, a transferee may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferee's acquisition of our common units. A transferee may also bear the cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated to a transferor through a reduction in the cash distributed to the transferee.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests within a 12-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all common unitholders and may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the holder's taxable income for the year of termination. A termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred.\nNon-U.S. persons could face different U.S. tax issues from owning common units than U.S. persons, and such differences may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nSome of our investment activities may cause us to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income (\"ECI\") with respect to a non-U.S. Holders. A \"non-U.S. Holder\" is a beneficial owner of the common units that is not a U.S. Holder (generally, a common unitholder that is a \"United States person\" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and is not an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, dividends received from an investment that we make in a REIT that are attributable to gains from the sale of U.S. real property interests and sales of certain investments in interests in U.S. real property, including stock of certain U.S. corporations owning significant U.S. real property, may be treated as ECI with respect to non-U.S. Holders. In addition, certain income of non-U.S. Holders from U.S. sources not connected to any such U.S. trade or business conducted\nby us could be treated as ECI. To the extent our income is treated as ECI, non-U.S. Holders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable shares of such income, would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting their allocable shares of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as ECI, and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular U.S. tax rates on any such income. Non-U.S. Holders that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax on their allocable share of such income. In addition, certain income from U.S. sources that is not ECI allocable to non-U.S. Holders will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective applicable tax rate. Finally, if we are treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a portion of any gain recognized by non-U.S. unitholders on the sale or exchange of common units may be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as ECI, and hence such non-U.S. unitholders could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the sale or exchange of common units.\nNon-U.S. persons may face adverse tax consequences in their countries of residence from owning common units.\nAres Management, L.P. will own interests in one or more entities in which no member has unlimited liability and which is treated as a fiscally transparent pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or a \"hybrid entity,\" such as a limited liability company. It is possible that a non-U.S. jurisdiction will treat such a hybrid entity as fiscally opaque. In that case, a non-U.S. Holder could be subject to different results in respect of timing and character of income and gain recognition, as well as the availability of losses, credits or deductions, including in respect of any taxes paid or deemed paid by or on behalf of the non-U.S. Holder, in such non-U.S. jurisdiction.\nTax-exempt entities face special U.S. federal income tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nA tax-exempt partner of a partnership generally must include in computing its \"unrelated business taxable income\" (\"UBTI\"), its pro rata share (whether or not distributed) of such partnership's gross income derived from a trade or business conducted by such partnership which is unrelated to the exempt function of the tax-exempt partner. Moreover, a tax-exempt partner of a partnership could be treated as earning UBTI to the extent that such partnership derives income from \"debt-financed property,\" or if the partnership interest itself is debt financed. Debt-financed property means property held to produce income with respect to which there is \"acquisition indebtedness\" (i.e., indebtedness incurred in acquiring or holding property). We are under no obligation to minimize UBTI, and a U.S. Holder of our common units that is a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, may be subject to \"unrelated business income tax\" to the extent, if any, that its allocable share of our income consists of UBTI.\nWe may not be able to furnish to each common unitholder specific tax information within 90 days after the close of each calendar year, which means that our common unitholders who are U.S. taxpayers may anticipate the need to file annually a request for an extension of the due date of their income tax return. In addition, it is possible that common unitholders who are otherwise required to file U.S. federal income tax returns may be required to file amended income tax returns.\nWe have agreed to furnish to each common unitholder, as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of each taxable year, tax information (including Schedule K-1), which describes on a U.S. dollar basis such holder's share of our taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for our preceding taxable year. It may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lower-tier entities. Consequently, holders of our common units who are U.S. taxpayers or otherwise required to file U.S. tax returns may need to file annually with the IRS (and, if applicable, certain states) a request for an extension past April 15 or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year. In addition, each common unitholder generally is required to file U.S. federal and state\ntax returns consistently with the information provided by us for the taxable year for all relevant tax purposes. In preparing this information, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions, some of which have been mentioned in the previous discussion, to determine such holder's share of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The IRS or state tax authorities may successfully contend that certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible, which could result in an adjustment to such holder's income or loss and could result in an increase in overall tax due. Additionally, we may be audited by taxing authorities from time to time. Adjustments resulting from a tax audit may require a holder to adjust a prior year's tax liability and possibly may result in an audit of such holder's own tax return. Any audit of such holder's tax return could result in adjustments not related to our tax returns as well as those related to our tax returns, and could result in an increase in overall tax due.\nWe may hold or acquire certain investments through entities classified as PFICs or CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nCertain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such an entity may be a passive foreign investment company (a \"PFIC\") or a controlled foreign corporation (a \"CFC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of common units considered to own an interest in a PFIC or a CFC may experience adverse U.S. federal and state income tax consequences.\nApplicable U.S. tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors.\nUnder Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections, along with the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, commonly referred to as \"FATCA\"), a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions are required to comply with a U.S. tax reporting regime or be subject to certain U.S. withholding taxes. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require foreign financial institutions to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain account holders and investors to the IRS (or in the case of certain foreign financial institutions that are resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (\"IGA\") to implement this legislation, to comply with comparable non-U.S. laws implementing the IGA). Additionally, certain non-U.S. entities that are not foreign financial institutions are required to provide certain certifications or other information regarding their U.S. beneficial ownership or be subject to certain U.S. withholding taxes under FATCA. There are uncertainties regarding the implementation of FATCA and it is difficult to determine at this time what impact any future administrative guidance may have. The administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some foreign investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors or reduce the demand for our common units. Moreover, we expect to incur additional expenses related to our compliance with FATCA, which could increase our tax compliance costs generally.\nCertain U.S. holders of common units are subject to additional tax on \"net investment income\".\nU.S. holders of common units that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a Medicare tax of 3.8% on \"net investment income\" (or undistributed \"net investment income,\" in the case of estates and trusts) for each taxable year, with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such person's adjusted gross income (with certain adjustments) over a specified amount. Net investment income includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of investment property. It is anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in our common units will be included in U.S. holder's \"net investment income\" subject to this Medicare tax.", "PERMNO": 14617, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "ARES"}
