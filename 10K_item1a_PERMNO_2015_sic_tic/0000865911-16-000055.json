{"cik": "865911", "company": "CASCADE BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, that could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, regulatory capital levels or prospects. The Company describes below the most significant of these risks and uncertainties in connection with both the Company\u2019s business and operations. These should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list or in any particular order. Additional risks that are not currently considered material may also have an adverse effect on the Company. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nBefore making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the specific risks detailed in Item 1A; other risks facing the Company identified in this report, including, risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified in this report that are difficult to predict and that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, regulatory capital levels and prospects; the information in Item 1; and the information in Item 7, including the Company\u2019s cautionary statements as to forward-looking statements.\nRisks related to our business\nOur business is closely tied to the local economies of Oregon, Idaho and Washington.\nThe Company\u2019s business is closely tied to the economies of Oregon, Idaho and Washington in general and is particularly affected by the economies of Central, Southern and Northwest Oregon, as well as the greater Boise/Treasure Valley, Idaho and Seattle, Washington metro areas. In addition, the Company has a significant concentration in real estate lending that is directly affected by local and regional economic conditions. Approximately 72% of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 consisted of loans secured by real estate, including construction and development loans, residential mortgage loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate, a strong majority of which are located in Oregon and Idaho. Since the end of the great recession of 2008, the economies of Oregon, Idaho and Washington have generally stabilized or are recovering, the housing market has improved and prices have increased, and vacancy rates for commercial properties have stabilized. The Company\u2019s markets, however, continue to be sensitive to general economic trends and conditions, including real estate values, and an unforeseen economic shock or a return of adverse economic conditions could cause deterioration of local economies and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough economic conditions have improved in recent years, financial institutions are affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets. Between 2008 and 2011, significant declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including the Company. While conditions have improved and continue to indicate a stable recovery, there can be no assurance that these conditions will persist. A return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on the Company\u2019s borrowers and other customers that would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may also face the following risks in connection with possible adverse economic events:\n\u2022Ineffective monetary policy could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability and overall financial condition.\n\u2022Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u2022Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of our industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue business opportunities and increase the Company\u2019s exposure to the judicial system and the plaintiff\u2019s bar.\nThe Company may not be able to attract or retain key banking employees, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe Company expects future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with its customers by its executives and senior lending officers. The Company has entered into employment agreements with several members of senior management. The existence of such agreements, however, does not necessarily ensure that the Company will be able to continue to retain the services of these senior management members.\nThe Company\u2019s future successes and profitability are substantially dependent upon the management and banking abilities of its senior executives. The Company strives to attract and retain key banking professionals, management and staff. Competition to attract the best professionals in the industry can be intense which will limit the Company\u2019s ability to hire new professionals. Banking-related revenues and net income could be adversely affected in the event of the unexpected loss of key personnel.\nThe Company may be required to increase its reserve for credit losses and to charge off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains a reserve for credit losses in an amount that the Company believes is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the reserve reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; industry concentrations; and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the reserve for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the reserve for credit losses. Increases in non-performing loans have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s reserve for credit losses. Generally, the Company\u2019s non-performing loans reflect difficulties of individual borrowers resulting from financial stress on the borrowers\u2019 asset values and cash flow abilities often related to the weakness in general economic conditions and/or adversity in sector specific situations.\nIf real estate markets or the economy in general deteriorate, the Company may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses. The reserve for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan-related losses. Additionally, banking regulators may require the Company to increase its reserve for credit losses in the future, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s reserve for credit losses is a significant accounting estimate and may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains a reserve for credit losses in an amount that the Company believes is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While the Company strives to monitor credit quality and to identify adversely risk rated loans on a consistent and timely basis, including those that may become non-performing, at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses that have not been identified as problem or non-performing loans. Estimation of the reserve requires the Company to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. These assumptions and judgments include historical loan loss experience, current credit profiles of the Bank\u2019s borrowers, adverse situations that have occurred that may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations, the estimated value of underlying collateral and general economic conditions. Determining the appropriateness of the reserve is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become non-performing assets or that it will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified. As a result, future increases to the reserve for credit losses may be necessary. Additionally, future increases to the reserve for credit losses may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising the loan portfolio, deteriorating values in underlying collateral (most of which consists of real estate in the markets served) and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as those that may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of incorrect assumptions by management in determining the reserve for credit loss. Finally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a proposed Accounting Standards Update that presents a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model, which would require financial institutions to estimate and develop a provision for credit losses at origination for the lifetime of the loan, as opposed to reserving for incurred or probable losses up to the balance sheet date. Under the CECL model, credit deterioration would be reflected in the income statement in the period of origination or acquisition of the loan, with changes in expected credit losses due to further credit deterioration or improvement reflected in the periods in which the expectation changes. Accordingly, the CECL model could require financial institutions like the Bank to increase their allowances for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model likely would create more volatility in our level of allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe it money.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. The Company\u2019s rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations the Company holds could result in losses and/or adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. The Company relies on representations of potential borrowers and/or guarantors as to the accuracy and completeness of certain financial information. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if the financial statements or other information that the Company relies upon is materially misleading.\nReal estate values could decline leading to additional and greater-than-anticipated loan charge-offs and valuation write downs on OREO and OREO-related management and disposition expenses.\nReal estate owned by the Bank and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d). In its normal lending process, the Bank may take a security interest in real estate as collateral for loans. In the event of obligor default, the Bank may have the right to foreclose on such collateral and take title to it. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had OREO with a carrying value of approximately $3.3 million. Generally, higher levels of OREO lead to greater expenses as the Bank incurs costs to manage and dispose of the properties, including personnel costs, insurance, taxes, completion costs, repair costs and other costs associated with property ownership. There are also funding costs associated with OREO. The Bank evaluates property values periodically and establishes valuation reserves, as appropriate, to adjust the carrying value of the properties to the lesser of book or appraised value, net of selling costs and any additional liquidation reserves to expedite the sale of such properties. Decreases in market prices may lead to additional OREO valuation reserves, with a corresponding expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of income. Further valuation reserves of OREO or an inability to sell OREO properties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of business, the Company may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or remediate hazardous or toxic substances at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the contaminated site. If the Company becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and ability to fund operations could be impaired by liquidity risk.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s primary funding source is customer deposits. In addition, the Bank has historically had access to advances from the FHLB, the FRB discount window and other wholesale sources such as Internet-sourced deposits to fund operations. Although the Company has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future. An inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowings, or the sale of securities or loans would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources on terms which are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. The Company has ample liquidity as of December 31, 2015; however, the Company\u2019s ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by the Company\u2019s financial condition or regulatory restrictions, or impaired by factors that are not specific to the Company, such as FDIC insurance changes, disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry. The Bank\u2019s primary counterparty for borrowing purposes is the FHLB and liquid assets are mainly held at correspondent banks or the FRB. Borrowing capacity from the FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the condition of the Bank or the acceptability and risk rating of securities or loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion. The FRB or FHLB could restrict or limit the Company\u2019s access to secured borrowings. Correspondent banks can withdraw unsecured lines of credit or require collateralization for the purchase of federal funds. Liquidity also may be affected by the Bank\u2019s routine commitments to extend credit.\nSources of funds may not remain adequate for liquidity needs and the Company may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms to provide necessary liquidity, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nHistorically low interest rates and changes in interest rates may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years, it has been the policy of the FRB to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate. As a result, market rates on the loans the Company has originated and the yields on securities the Company has purchased have been at lower levels than available prior to 2008. As a general matter, the Company\u2019s interest-bearing assets reprice or mature slightly more quickly than the Company\u2019s interest-earning liabilities, which have resulted in decreases in net interest income as interest rates decreased. However, the Company\u2019s ability to lower its interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. The FRB has indicated its intention to be patient in its determination whether to increase interest rates in the future.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations are highly dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings. In addition, changes to the market interest rates may impact the level of loans, deposits and investments and the credit quality of existing loans. These rates may be affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may be affected, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability. Also, changes in interest rates may negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, as well as the Company's market values of its financial instruments, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services business is intensely competitive and the Company may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe Company faces competition for its services from a variety of competitors. The Company\u2019s future growth and success depend on its ability to compete effectively. The Company competes for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous financial service providers including banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage companies, broker dealers and insurance companies and increasingly other non-bank financial services providers who use the Internet as a platform to originate loans and/or acquire deposits. To the extent these competitors have less regulatory constraints, lower cost structures or increased economies of scale, they may be able to offer a greater variety of products and services or more favorable pricing for such products and services. In addition, improvements in technology, communications and the Internet have intensified competition. As a result, the Company\u2019s competitive position could be weakened, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks or uncertainties associated with these types of efforts, particularly in instances where the markets may not be fully developed. Significant time and resources may be invested in developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services and successful implementation may not be achieved or price and profitability targets may not be obtained. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Additionally, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with the Company\u2019s Internet-based systems and online commerce security, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentify theft,\u201d could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company delivers its services both through its branch network and the Internet. The Company relies heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing software, communications systems and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct its business. Third party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. The Company\u2019s operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render the Company\u2019s customer information inaccurate. These events may obstruct the Company\u2019s ability to provide services and process transactions. While the Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put its customer confidential information at risk.\nWhile the Company believes that it has appropriate protective measures in place, the Company can never be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. The Company monitors and modifies, as necessary, its protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of cyber threats.\nA breach in the security of any of the Company\u2019s information systems, or other cyber incident, could have a material adverse effect on, among other things, its revenue, ability to attract and maintain customers and business reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, the Company could incur higher costs to conduct its business, to increase protection, or related to remediation.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s customers could incorrectly blame the Company and terminate their accounts with the Bank for a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nIn response to the Executive Order released by the Obama Administration, Improving Critical Ingrastructure Cybersecurity, referred to as the Executive Order, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council developed a cybersecurity\nassessment tool to help institutions identify their risks and determine their cybersecurity preparedness. The FFIEC has also published cybersecurity guidance on its website, along with observations from recent cybersecurity assessments. The federal banking agencies have indicated that they will use the assessment tool as guidance during a financial institution\u2019s safety and soundness examination. Although we have used the assessment tool to develop policies and procedures related to our cybersecurity, no assurance can be given that the regulators will believe that our information security systems are adequate or that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing cyber threats and attacks. Furthermore, the implementation of any recommended guidance could require us to incur additional costs.\nThe Company continually encounters technological changes and may not have the resources to invest in technological improvements.\nFrequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services in the financial services industry result in the need for rapid technological change. In addition, the effective use of technology may result in improved customer service and reduced costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, to a certain extent, on its ability to identify the needs of customers and address those needs by using technology to provide the desired products and services and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Certain competitors may have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to successfully implement new technology-driven products and services or to effectively market these products and services to the Company\u2019s customers. Failure to implement the necessary technological changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies heavily on technology and computer systems, and computer failure could result in loss of business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdvances and changes in technology could significantly affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Company faces many challenges, including the increased demand for providing customers access to their accounts and the systems to perform banking transactions electronically. The Company\u2019s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet these demands. In addition, the Company\u2019s business and operations are susceptible to negative effects from computer system failures, communication and energy disruption and unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of its data processing systems.\nThe Company could incur losses due to operating disruptions.\nOperating disruptions could occur without warning, and the results may be predictable or unknown. Disruptions could be either internal or external, and could include natural disasters, technological failures, pandemic events, human error, or terrorism. In alignment with regulatory guidance, the Company has developed detailed Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans to mitigate the impact of a disaster, provide for operations at backup facilities, and minimize risk to the organization, its customers, stockholders, and reputation. These plans may or may not be sufficient to mitigate or prevent material loss to the Company in an event that disrupts operations. External events could also affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nChanges or disruptions in the market for certain securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio could negatively affect the value of those securities.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio includes a variety of securities that are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. The portfolio includes obligations of, and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by, government sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), and the FHLB or otherwise backed by Federal Housing Administration or Veteran\u2019s Administration guaranteed loans. In addition, the porfolio contains non-GSE securities, including debt issued by public entities that are secured by expected future cash flows of the issuer. Adverse general economic conditions, credit risk associated with the collateral or guarantors of securities, and volatility or illiquidity in markets may cause investment securities held within the Company\u2019s investment portfolio to fall in value and/or become less liquid. Should securities become impaired, they may be subject to material write-downs thereby impacting results of operations or financial condition of the Company. In addition, market conditions may reduce valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities. Possible FRB actions to increase interest rates in the future may cause a decline in the value of securities held by the Company. Declines in market value associated with these disruptions would result in impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, equity and capital ratios.\nIf the goodwill that the Company has recorded or may record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets the Company acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s goodwill totaled $78.6 million. While the Company has not recorded any impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that future evaluations of the Company\u2019s existing goodwill or goodwill it may acquire in the future will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has made acquisitions, and may do so in the future, which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 stock ownership and expose it to additional risks.\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s strategic plan, it regularly evaluates opportunities to acquire other banks and branch locations to expand the Company. As a result, the Company may engage in acquisitions and other transactions that could have a material effect on its operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition activities could require it to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, issue shares of common stock and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then the Company would be required to recognize a charge against earnings, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve;\n\u2022incurring the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022incurring the time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022the possibility that the Company will be unable to successfully implement integration strategies, due to challenges associated with integrating complex systems, technology, banking centers, and other assets of the acquired bank in a manner that minimizes any adverse effect on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies;\n\u2022the possibility that the acquisition may not be timely completed, if at all; and\n\u2022losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nIf the Company does not successfully manage these risks, its acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nNew or acquired banking office facilities and other facilities may not be profitable.\nThe Company may not be able to identify profitable locations for new banking offices. The costs to start up new banking offices or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase the Company\u2019s non-interest expense and decrease our earnings in the short term. If branches of other banks become available for sale, the Company may acquire those offices. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage our growth through the establishment or purchase of additional banking offices and the Company can provide no assurance that any such banking offices will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses of their operation. In addition, any new or acquired banking offices will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in securing such approval.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors, which presents certain risks to our business, including the risk that they may not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Company. Accordingly, external vendors are a course of operational and information security risk to us. The Company\u2019s\noperations are exposed to risk that these external vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. Moreover, external vendors\u2019 market power significantly limits our ability to be indemnified for a vendor\u2019s negligence and insurance does not adequately cover all such exposure. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such a failure may force the Company to replace or renegotiate contracts with external vendors which could entail significant operational expense and delays for the Company.\nWe may be subject to potential liability and business risk from actions by our regulators related to supervision of third parties.\nOversight management by us of third parties by which we acquire deposit accounts and offer products and services, may be required to be expanded by our auditors or regulators. Although we have added significant compliance staff and have used outside consultants, our internal and external compliance examiners must be satisfied with the results of such augmentation and enhancement. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy all related requirements. Not achieving a compliance management system which is deemed adequate could result a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ongoing review and analysis of our compliance management systems and implementation of any changes resulting from that review and analysis will likely result in increased noninterest expense.\nThe Bank is a community bank and its ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of its business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe Bank is a community bank, and its reputation is one of the most valuable components of its business. A key component of the Bank\u2019s business strategy is to rely on its reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand its presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in its market area and contiguous areas. As such, the Bank strives to conduct its business in a manner that enhances its reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Bank\u2019s core values of being an integral part of the communities the Bank serves, delivering superior service to its customers and caring about its customers and associates. If Bancorp\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of their employees, by their inability to conduct their operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Bank is a public depository and, accordingly, accepts deposit funds that belong to, or are held for the benefit of, the State of Oregon, political subdivisions thereof, municipal corporations and other public funds. In accordance with applicable state law, in the event of default of one bank, all participating banks in the state collectively assure that no loss of funds is suffered by any public depositor. Generally, in the event of default by a depository of public funds in excess of collateral pledged, an assessment applicable to all public depositories is allocated on a pro rata basis in proportion to the maximum liability of each public depository as it existed on the date of loss. The maximum liability is dependent upon potential changes in regulations, the occurrence of Oregon bank failures and the level of public fund deposits held by the failing bank and cannot be presently determined.\nIn 2015, the amount of collateral the Bank was required to pledge against Oregon public deposits was 50% of the uninsured portion of these Oregon public deposits, but the percentage of collateral required to be pledged could be increased in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Company\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure. Such losses may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks related to an investment in Cascade\u2019s common stock\nThe Company may be restricted from paying or may determine not to pay dividends.\nBancorp is a separate legal entity from the Bank and substantially all of its revenues are derived from the Bank dividends. Oregon law prohibits the Bank from paying dividends to Bancorp unless the Bank has positive retained earnings. The Bank received regulatory approval to adjust retained earnings to zero at September 30, 2012, but the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends will remain constrained under Oregon law by the amount of increases in its retained earnings from that date. In addition, regulators previously have required Bancorp to obtain permission prior to payment of dividends on Cascade common stock and prior to taking a dividend from the Bank. Although such requirements have been terminated, it is possible that regulators may impose the same or similar requirements or limitations on the dividends. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Bancorp in the future, Bancorp may not be able to pay dividends on Cascade common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or price of Cascade common stock. In addition, if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Bancorp in the future, Bancorp may not be able to pay its creditors, which could result in a default or acceleration of Bancorp\u2019s debt obligations or have a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s reputation.\nCascade\u2019s stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to its investors and litigation against Cascade.\nCascade\u2019s stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, Cascade\u2019s announcement of developments related to its businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, concerns, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Cascade\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our investors to sell their common stock when they desire and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. The Company could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from Cascade\u2019s normal business.\nThe existence of outstanding stock options issued to the Company\u2019s current or former executive officers, directors, and employees may result in dilution of your ownership.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding options to purchase 3,375,909 shares of its common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.44 per share. All of these options are held by the Company\u2019s current or former executive officers, directors, and employees. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had the ability to issue options and restricted stock to purchase an additional 269,270 shares of our common stock. The issuance of shares subject to options under the equity compensation plans will result in dilution of the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership of our common stock.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe banking industry and the Company operate under certain regulatory requirements that may change significantly and in a manner that further impairs revenues, operating income and financial condition.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the DFCS, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board. The regulations affect the Company\u2019s investment practices, lending activities and dividend policy, among other things. Moreover, federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent and often significant changes and have been subject to significant change in recent years, sometimes retroactively applied, and may change significantly in the future. Changes to these laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could,\namong other things, make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for the Company, limit the products the Company can offer or increase the ability of non-banks to compete and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business in significant but unpredictable ways, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Included in the Dodd-Frank Act are, for example, changes related to deposit insurance assessments, executive compensation and corporate governance requirements, payment of interest on demand deposits, interchange fees and overdraft services. The Dodd-Frank Act also resulted in the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d for banks and bank holding companies, which prohibits proprietary trading, investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, and otherwise limit the relationships with such funds. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years, making it difficult at this time to anticipate the overall financial impact of this expansive legislation on the Company, its customers or the financial industry generally. Likewise, any new consumer financial protection laws enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, that would apply to all banks and thrifts may increase the Company\u2019s compliance and operational costs in the future.\nIn addition, the banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule effective January 1, 2015 that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework and revises the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations to strengthen identified areas of weakness in the capital rules and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule establishes a stricter regulatory capital framework that requires banking organizations to hold more and higher-quality capital to act as a financial cushion to absorb losses and help banking organizations better withstand periods of financial stress.\nThe Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation. The Company\u2019s compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may restrict certain activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits, access to capital and brokered deposits and locations of banking offices. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in fines, penalties, sanctions and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the Company fails to maintain sufficient capital under regulatory requirements, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, that failure would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to maintain regulatory compliance.\nBancorp and the Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor preferences regarding the banking industry and market condition and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements or is unable to raise additional capital when needed, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income and future growth.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, issued rules that implemented the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework and revised the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations in order to strengthen identified areas of weakness in capital rules and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules apply to both Bancorp and the Bank.\nAs a result of the enactment of the Basel III Rules, the Company recently became subject to increased required capital levels. The Basel III Rules became effective as applied to us on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Bank Holding Company Regulation - New Capital Rules.\u201d\nAlthough the Company currently cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that Basel III will have on the Company and the banking industry more generally, the Company will be required to maintain higher regulatory capital levels which could impact the Company\u2019s operations, net income and ability to grow. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in regulators taking formal or informal actions against the Company, which could restrict future growth or operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premium could be higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges the insured financial institutions assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund at a certain level; if an FDIC-insured financial institution fails, payments of deposits up to insured limits are made from the Deposit Insurance Fund. An increase in the risk category of the Bank, adjustments to assessment rates and/or a special assessment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s monetary or fiscal policies could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Board has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of depository institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve Board affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its purchases of government and other securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its management of bank reserve requirements. The Company cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.\nThe Company could be subject to fines, sanctions or other adverse consequences if it fails to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth in Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Lending Laws or other laws and regulations.\nFinancial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial Institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the Company is required to develop compliance management systems designed to detect and prevent violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth in Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Lending Laws and similar laws and regulations. The federal government has imposed and is expected to expand these and other laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. The Company has developed policies and continues to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, however no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if our consumer facing operations do not operate in compliance with applicable regulations.\nWhile all aspects of our operations are subject to detailed and complex compliance regimes, bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and consumer compliance, and we expect this focus to continue. As a result, those portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers, in particular our mortgage operations, credit card and other consumer lending business, pose particular challenges. While we are not aware of any material issues with our compliance, mortgage and other consumer lending raises significant compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and other consumer lending regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent operating environment in which loan officers operate. As a result, despite the education, compliance training, supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with these regulations could result in the Bank being strictly liable for restitution or damages to individual borrowers, and to a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts the Company\u2019s operations and capital requirements.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending directed at institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending portfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Based on our commercial real estate concentration as of December 31, 2015, the Company believes that it is operating within the guidelines. However, increases in the Company\u2019s commercial real estate lending, particularly as it expands into metropolitans markets and make more of these loans, could subject it to additional supervisory analysis. The Company cannot guarantee that any risk management practices it implements will be effective to prevent losses relating to its commercial real estate portfolio. Management has implemented controls to monitor the Company\u2019s commercial real estate lending concentrations, but it cannot predict the extent to which this guidance will impact its operations or capital requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue to receive the benefits of its loss share arrangements with the FDIC is conditioned upon its compliance with certain requirements under the agreements.\nThe Company is the beneficiary of loss share agreements with the FDIC that call for the FDIC to fund a portion of our losses on a majority of the assets the Company acquired in the Home acquisition that came from Home\u2019s FDIC-assisted transaction, entered into in September 2009 and September 2010. To recover a portion of the losses and retain the loss share protection, the Company must comply with certain requirements imposed by the agreements. The requirements of the agreements relate primarily to the administration of the assets covered by the agreements, as well as the Company obtaining the consent of the FDIC to engage in certain corporate transactions that may be deemed under the agreements to constitute a transfer of the loss share benefits.\nWhen the consent of the FDIC is required under the loss share agreements, the FDIC may withhold its consent or may condition its consent on terms that we do not find acceptable. If the FDIC does not grant its consent to a transaction the Company would like to pursue, or conditions its consent on terms that the Company does not find acceptable, the Company may be unable to engage in a corporate transaction that might otherwise benefit its stockholders or the Company may elect to pursue such a transaction without obtaining the FDIC\u2019s consent, which could result in termination of the loss share agreements with the FDIC.\nAdditionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms (10 years for net losses on single-family residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC, five years for losses on non-residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC, and an additional three years with respect to recoveries on non-residential real estate loans); therefore, any charge-off of related losses after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact the Company\u2019s net income. Further, when the loss sharing agreements expire, the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s risk-based capital ratios may be reduced. While the agreements are in place, the covered assets receive a 20% risk-weighting. When the agreements expire, the risk-weighting for previously covered assets will most likely increase to 100%, based on current regulatory capital definitions. Nearly all of the assets remaining in the covered asset portfolios are non-single family covered assets. Therefore, most of the covered assets were no longer indemnified after September 2014 or September 2015.\nThe loss sharing arrangements with the FDIC will not cover all of the losses on loans the Company acquired through the acquisition of Home.\nAlthough the Company has assumed loss share agreements with the FDIC that provide that the FDIC will bear a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios that it acquired through the Home acquisition, the Company is not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms (10 years for net losses on single-family residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC, five years for losses on non-residential real estate loans, as defined by the FDIC, and an additional three years with respect to recoveries on non-residential real estate loans). Therefore, the FDIC will not reimburse the Company for any charge-off or related losses that it experiences after the term of the loss share agreements, and any such charge-offs would negatively impact its net income. Moreover, the loss share provisions in the loss share agreement may be administered improperly, or the FDIC may interpret those provisions in a way different than the Company does. In any of those events, the Company\u2019s losses on loans could increase.\nThe FDIC requires that the Company make a \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment to the FDIC if its realized losses are less than expected.\nThe loss share agreements that the Company assumed in the acquisition of Home, related to Home\u2019s FDIC-assisted acquisitions of Community First Bank and Liberty Bank, contain a provision that obligates the Company to make a \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment to the FDIC if the realized losses of that acquired bank are less than expected. The \u201ctrue-up\u201d calculation is scheduled to be made as of the 45th day following the last day of the calendar month of the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisitions of the acquired banks. Any such \u201ctrue-up\u201d payment that is materially higher than current estimates could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 80112, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CACB"}
