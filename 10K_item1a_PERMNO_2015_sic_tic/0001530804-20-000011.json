{"cik": "1530804", "company": "Tronox Holdings plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for our end-use products, could adversely affect the results of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, thus, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenue and results of operations are significantly dependent on sales of TiO2 products and zircon. Demand for these products historically have been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic and market conditions. Such events can cause a decrease in demand for our products and market prices to fall, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities that reprice as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the results of operations tend to vary with changes in the business cycle.\nA significant portion of the demand for our TiO2 products comes from manufacturers of paint and plastics. A significant portion of the demand for zircon comes from industrial customers particularly those that serve the construction industry. Our customers may experience significant fluctuations in demand for their own end products because of economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, or increases in raw material and energy costs. In addition, with respect to the zircon market, we believe that China currently accounts for approximately 50% of the world\u2019s demand for zircon. As such, any prolonged downturn in China, including, among other things, due to the coronavirus, with respect to the demand for zircon could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe price of our products, in particular, TiO2, zircon, and feedstock/other products, have been, and in the future may be, volatile. Price declines for our products will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nHistorically, the global market for TiO2 and zircon have been volatile, and those markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. Prices for TiO2 and zircon may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, these products, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control. Factors that affect the price of our products include, among other things:\n\u2022overall economic conditions;\n\u2022the level of customer demand particularly in the paint, plastics and construction industries;\n\u2022the level of production and exports of our products globally;\n\u2022the level of production and cost of materials used to produce our products;\n\u2022the cost of energy consumed in the production of TiO2 and zircon, including the price of natural gas, electricity and coal;\n\u2022the impact of competitors increasing their capacity and exports;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental relations, tariffs or other trade disputes, regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022political conditions or hostilities and unrest in regions where we export our TiO2, zircon and feedstock/other products.\nPricing pressure with respect to our TiO2 products and zircon can make it difficult to predict the cash we may have on hand at any given time, and a prolonged period of price declines may materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations.\nOur industry and the end-use markets in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Competition in the TiO2 industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and smaller regional competitors, including producers in China. Moreover, Chinese producers have significantly expanded their production capacity in recent years and have also commenced the commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology. The risk of substitution of these Chinese producers by our customers could increase as these Chinese producers expand their use of chloride technology and continue to improve the quality of their sulfate products.\nMoreover, we compete with a large number of mining companies with respect to zircon. Zircon producers generally compete on the basis of price, quality, logistics, delivery, and payment terms and consistency of supply.\nWithin the end-use markets in which we compete, competition between products is intense. We face substantial risk that our customers could switch to our competitors\u2019 products in response to any number of developments including new product development by competitors, changing customer needs, increased commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology, greater acceptance of TiO2 via sulfate technology in end-market applications previously characterized by TiO2 via chloride technology, production advances for competing products, price changes in raw materials, or, with respect to zircon customers, switching to lower priced substitute products. Our inability to develop, produce or market our products to compete effectively against our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAn increase in the price of energy or other raw materials, or an interruption in our energy or other raw material supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining, beneficiation, smelting and production processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which can be subject to worldwide, as well as, local supply and demand, as well as other factors beyond our control. In 2019, ore, process chemicals and energy used in the production of TiO2 constituted approximately 33 %, 16% and 9%, respectively, of our operating expenses. Fuel and energy linked to commodities, such as diesel, heavy fuel oil and coal, and other consumables, such as chlorine, illuminating paraffin, electrodes, and anthracite, consumed in our TiO2 manufacturing and mining operations form an important part of our TiO2 operating costs. We have no control over the costs of these consumables, many of which are linked to some degree to the price of oil and coal, and the costs of many of these raw materials may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems. These fluctuations could negatively affect our operating margins, our results of operations or planned capital expenditures. As these costs rise, our operating expenses will increase and could adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers.\nThe markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nThe demand for our products is subject to seasonal fluctuations. TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings where demand increases prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer). Additionally, although zircon is generally a non-seasonal product, it is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.\nConcentrated ownership of our ordinary shares by Cristal and Exxaro may prevent minority shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Cristal Inorganic, an affiliate of Cristal, and Exxaro own approximately 26% and 10%, respectively, of our outstanding ordinary shares. As such, Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may be able to influence fundamental corporate matters and transactions. This concentration of ownership, may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders. The interests of Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Also, Cristal Inorganic and Exxaro may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our other shareholders.\nIn addition, under the shareholders agreement (the \u201cCristal Shareholders Agreement\u201d) we entered into at the closing of the Cristal Transaction with Cristal, as long as Cristal Inorganic and the three shareholders of Cristal (collectively, the \u201cCristal Shareholders\u201d) collectively beneficially own at least 24,900,000 or more of our ordinary shares, they have the right to designate for nomination two directors of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). As long as the Cristal Shareholders collectively beneficially own at least 12,450,000 ordinary shares but less than 24,900,000 ordinary shares, they have the right to designate for nomination one director of the Board. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement also provides that as long as the Cristal Shareholders collectively beneficially own at least 12,450,000 ordinary shares they have certain preemptive rights. Also under the Cristal Shareholders Agreement, upon written notice from Cristal, we have agreed to file a registration statement covering 6,532,738 shares which may be sold as soon as such registration statement is effective. Other than with respect to those shares, the Cristal Shareholders Agreement includes restrictions on Cristal Inorganic\u2019s ability to transfer any of its ordinary shares (a) prior to April 10, 2021 other than to certain permitted transferees after the later of (i) eighteen months from the close of the Cristal Transaction, and (ii) the resolution of all indemnification claims under the transaction agreement, and (b) prior to December 31, 2022, if such transfer would cause an \"ownership change\" as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"). The Cristal Shareholders Agreement also contains certain demand and piggyback registration rights, which, other than with respect to the 6,532,738 shares, commence after the transfer restriction period expires.\nAs a result of these or other factors, including as a result of any offering of shares by Cristal or Exxaro, or the perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant shareholders or with significant outstanding shares with registration rights.\nOur South African mining rights are subject to onerous regulatory requirements imposed by legislation and the Department of Mineral Resources (the \u201cDMR\u201d), the compliance of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack economic empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d) legislation was introduced into South Africa as a means to seek to redress the inequalities of the previous apartheid system by requiring the inclusion of historically disadvantaged South Africans in the mainstream economy. Under BEE legislation, South African businesses are required to become \u201cempowered\u201d and in the mining sector comply with a distinct \u201csector charter.\u201d As of March 1, 2019, South African mining companies, such as ours, are required to comply with Mining Charter III which was first promulgated by the DMR in September, 2018. While Mining Charter II previously required a 26% ownership by a BEE empowered entity, new Mining Charter III requires a 30% BEE shareholding that must be structured through a special purpose vehicle comprised of black entrepreneurs, the local community surrounding the relevant mining area and eligible employees. In addition, Mining Charter III sets forth new requirements with regard to the procurement of goods and services from BEE compliant entities; race, age and gender based ownership criteria and employment quotas; and workers\u2019 housing and living conditions. While we believe we are currently in compliance with the provisions of Mining Charter III, the implementation guidelines promulgated in December 2018 are complex and remain untested. As a result, the manner in which Mining Charter III is enforced by the DMR may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBy virtue of the fact that prior to 2017 Exxaro was greater than 50% owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans and that it continued to hold a 26% ownership interest in our two South African operating entities, for purposes of our existing mining rights Exxaro had historically enabled us to comply with the BEE requirements of Mining Charter II, the predecessor sector charter to Mining Charter III. We believe that under Mining Charter III the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies to our existing mining rights. Hence, for the duration of our current mining rights we can comply with all relevant BEE requirements regardless of Exxaro\u2019s ownership in our two South African operating entities. However, Mining Charter III requires that applications for renewals of existing mining rights or any new mining rights that we may desire to acquire in the future will require 30% historically disadvantaged South African ownership in the ratios set out in Mining Charter III.\n\u201cOnce empowered always empowered\u201d means that a South African company that has had the requisite shareholding base consisting of historically disadvantaged South Africans as at December 31, 2014 will always qualify as an \u201cempowered\u201d entity for purposes of the retention of an existing mining right for the duration of that right. The question of whether the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies in the mining industry in South Africa has been subject to litigation between the Minerals Council of South Africa (the \u201cMinerals Council\u201d) (formerly the Chamber of Mines, an industry body that represents approximately 90% of the South African Mining Industry) and the DMR. Although the South African High Court decided in the affirmative for the Minerals Council, the DMR has appealed the High Court ruling and the outcome remains pending. It is our opinion that the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d is applicable to our existing mining rights, but not in respect of applications for renewals of existing mining rights or applications for new mining rights made under the Mining Charter III. If DMR were to challenge our compliance with Mining Charter III or \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d is otherwise not fully recognized, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nWe may elect to exercise certain \u201cflip in\u201d rights to buy-out Exxaro\u2019s 26% ownership rights in our South African subsidiaries which might negatively impact the ownership of our heavy mineral sands mining rights.\nIn connection with the 2012 transaction with Exxaro, Exxaro was granted a \u201cflip in\u201d right such that following the occurrence of certain events, Exxaro would be entitled to exchange its 26% shareholding in our South African operating subsidiaries which hold our mining licenses for an additional 7.2 million ordinary shares. On November 26, 2018, we, certain of our subsidiaries and Exxaro entered into the Exxaro Mineral Sands Transaction Completion Agreement (the \u201cCompletion Agreement\u201d) which amends the \u201cflip-in\u201d rights granted to Exxaro so that we may, subject to certain conditions, accelerate the occurrence of the \u201cflip in.\u201d If we elect to accelerate the \u201cflip in\u201d there can be no assurance that the DMR will not challenge our right to continue to operate our mineral sands mining operations based upon the failure of our South African subsidiaries to comply with all applicable BEE requirements. If DMR\u2019s challenge is successful, our existing mining rights could be suspended or revoked which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize anticipated benefits of the Cristal Transaction, including expected synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and free cash flow growth.\nThe success of the Cristal Transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, earnings per share accretion or EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired Cristal business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired Cristal businesses and operations successfully, including the achievement of Cristal Transaction-related synergies that meet or exceed our current expectations, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the Cristal Transaction that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. There is also the possibility that:\n\u2022we may fail to realize expected performance optimization, including increased volume production;\n\u2022the acquisition may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies, cultures and best practices;\n\u2022we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; and\n\u2022our post-acquisition revenue projections may be less than anticipated due to loss of customers, price volatility or reduced demand for the combined company\u2019s products.\nPrior to the consummation of the Cristal Transaction, Cristal was not a publicly reporting company and if we fail to successfully integrate it into our internal control over financial reporting, or if Cristal\u2019s internal controls are found to be ineffective, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nPrior to the Cristal Transaction, Cristal was a private company that was not subject to U.S. financial reporting requirements. Now that we have completed the Cristal Transaction, the Cristal business has become subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the NYSE. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, which, by the time our second annual report is filed with the SEC following the consummation of the Cristal Transaction, would include the acquired Cristal business. Bringing Cristal into compliance with these rules and regulations and integrating Cristal into our current compliance and accounting system may require us to make and document significant changes to Cristal\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Furthermore, the need to establish the necessary corporate infrastructure to integrate Cristal may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have begun integrating the Cristal business into our existing compliance and accounting processes, as well as begun implementing internal controls within the Cristal business that align with our existing controls, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of such efforts. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future or that any such weaknesses will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we discover a material weakness in our internal controls in the future, the disclosure of that fact could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and the market price of our securities may decline. These additional obligations or events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nFollowing the Cristal Transaction, our future results could suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded business, operations and employee base.\nAs a result of the Cristal Transaction, we more than doubled the size of our business, operations and employee base. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, operations and employee base, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may not be able to successfully manage the combined company\u2019s expanded business, operations and employee base.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nAs a result of the Cristal Transaction, we now have operations in new jurisdictions around the globe, including Brazil, China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (\u201cKSA\u201d), which subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022adapting to unfamiliar regional and geopolitical conditions and demands, including political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, changes to import or export regulations and fees, renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;\n\u2022increased difficulties with regard to political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u2022economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and new and unfamiliar laws and regulations at national, regional and local levels, including taxation regimes, tariffs and trade barriers, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings, and labor and environmental and health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022implementation of additional technological and cybersecurity measures and cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities;\n\u2022major public health issues which could cause disruptions in our operations or workforce;\n\u2022war or terrorist activities;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u2022unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.\nWith respect to major public health issues, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In early 2020, China began reporting on the spread of the coronavirus and thousands of cases of the disease have since been identified throughout the rest of Asia, as well as in Europe, the U.S., Latin America and other regions that are important to our business in terms of sales, manufacturing and other aspects of our supply chain. The coronavirus may impact the global economy, our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could have a material adverse effect result on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results, particularly with respect to our TiO2 production plants and mineral sands operations and the supply of our TiO2 and zircon products to our global customers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nPolitical and social instability, and unrest, and actual, or potential, armed conflicts in the Middle East region may affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations in KSA may be affected by the political, social and economic conditions from time to time prevailing in, or affecting, KSA or the wider Middle East region. For example, since 2011, a number of countries in the Middle East region have witnessed significant social unrest, including widespread public demonstrations, and, in certain cases, armed conflict, terrorist attacks, diplomatic disputes, foreign military intervention and a change of government. Armed conflict is currently ongoing in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Libya. In addition, KSA faces a number of challenges arising mainly from the relatively high levels of unemployment among the Saudi youth population, requests for political and social changes, and the security threat posed by certain groups. Should KSA experience similar political and social unrest as found in other countries in the Middle East, the Saudi Arabian economy could be adversely affected, our TiO2 plant located in Yanbu could be temporarily disrupted or materially adversely affected and our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, one of our TiO2 pigment plants is located in Yanbu, and the Slagger, that is subject to the Option or Put, is located in Jazan. Yanbu and Jazan have both been subject to rocket attacks from armed rebel groups fighting the KSA military in Yemen which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSouth Africa, where we have large mining assets and derive a significant portion of our revenue and profit, poses distinct operational risks which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn South Africa, we currently operate two significant mining assets, as well as accompanying separation plants and smelting operations, and derive a significant portion of our profit from the sale of zircon. Our mining and smelting operations depend on electrical power generated by Eskom, the sole, state-owned energy supplier. Eskom has not been able to reliably provide electrical\npower and as a result \u201cload-shedding\u201d (planned and unplanned rolling power outages) is expected for the foreseeable future. In addition, South African electricity prices have risen during the past few years, and future prices increases are expected to occur. As such, restrictions or additional conditions imposed by Eskom such as load shedding, electricity restrictions and/or electricity price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nIn addition, our KZN Sands operations currently use approximately 356,000 gigajoules of Sasol gas, which is available only from Sasol Limited. As such, an interruption in the supply of Sasol gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nMoreover, certain regions of South Africa have experienced in the past, and are prone to, drought conditions resulting in water restrictions being imposed in such areas. We use significant amounts of water in our South African operations. A prolonged drought in a region of South Africa where our operations are located may lead to water use restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, under South African law, our South African mining operations are subject to water-use licenses that govern each operation. These licenses require, among other conditions, that mining operations achieve and maintain certain water quality limits for all water discharges, where applicable. Changes to water-use licenses could increase our costs of operations thereby affecting our operational results and financial condition.\nOur operations in South Africa are also reliant on services provided by the State-owned, sole provider of rail transport, Transnet. Furthermore, Transnet provides extensive dockside services at both the ports of Richards Bay and Saldanha Bay via Transnet Port Authority. Delays or interruptions at either the rail service or the ports in which we receive and/or export material could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe aforementioned operational risks, as well as any other foreseen or unforeseen operational risks primarily related to doing business in South Africa, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an emerging market, South Africa poses a challenging array of long-term political and economic risks.\nSouth Africa continues to undergo political and economic challenges. Changes to, or instability in, the economic or political environment in South Africa, especially if such changes create political instability, actual or potential shortages of production materials or labor unrest, could result in production delays and production shortfalls, and materially impact our production and results of operations.\nThe South African government has recently embarked on a process of identifying and securing land for persons who were previously dispossessed of such land as a result of Apartheid policies. In December 2019, the South African government released a draft land expropriation bill for public comment. The land expropriation bill contemplates that, where it is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, land may be expropriated by the South African government, without compensation being payable to the current owners. While the South African government has indicated that such measures will be applied initially to state-owned land, it is possible that such measures may extend to agricultural and mining areas. We own the majority of the land on which the Namakwa Sands and KZN Sands operations are situated and have invested considerable funds in developing these areas. In the event that these areas become the subject of a land claim under any such proposed or future land expropriation bill, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, South Africa\u2019s exchange control regulations require resident companies to obtain the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank to raise capital in any currency other than the Rand, and restrict the export of capital from South Africa. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further change or abolish exchange control measures in the future. These exchange control restrictions could hinder our financial and strategic flexibility, particularly our ability to use South African capital to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and new projects outside of South Africa.\nMoreover, our operations have been affected by inflation in South Africa in recent years. Employment costs and wages in South Africa have increased in recent years, resulting in significant cost pressures for the mining industry. Prolonged or heightened inflation and associated cost pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our South African operations have entered into various collective agreements with organized labor regulating wages and working conditions at our mines and smelter operations. There have been periods when various stakeholders have been unable to agree on dispute resolution processes, leading to threats of disruptive industrial action disputes. Due to the high level of employee union membership, our South African operations are at risk of production stoppages for indefinite periods due to strikes and other labor disputes. Although we believe that we have good labor relations with our South African employees, we may experience labor disputes in the future.\nAs part of our community social investment initiative, our South African operations are actively seeking to empower and partner with our local communities in order to develop vendor potential and opportunities. While we have had a number of successes in these partnerships, there have been threats of violence if community expectations regarding the procurement of goods and services are not met. Any such violence or upheaval could result in production stoppages for indefinite periods of time.\nAlthough we believe that our relationships with our various local communities are good, the areas in which our South African operations are situated are the traditional homelands of various tribal groupings that are historically politically volatile. This volatility persists today and frequently results in violent, destructive behaviors. Increased volatility and any consequential civil unrest may result in production stoppages and/or the destruction of assets which comprise our South African operations, any of which could have an material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSouth African employment law, which is based on the minimum standard set by the International Labor Organization, sets out minimum terms and conditions of employment for employees. Although these may be improved by agreements between an employer and the trade unions, prescribed minimum terms and conditions form the benchmark for all employment contracts. Our South African operations are required to submit a report to the South African Department of Labor under South African employment law detailing the progress made towards achieving employment equity in the workplace. Failing to submit this report in a timely manner could result in substantial penalties. In addition, future legislative developments that affect South African employment policies may increase production costs or negatively impact relationships with employees and trade unions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards (which are now subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Code per the U.S. tax reform bill enacted on December 22, 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Pursuant to the Completion Agreement, Exxaro has agreed to sell down its remaining ownership interest in us in a manner that we believe will not cause us to lose, under limitations set forth in Section 382 of the Code, the benefit of approximately $4.1 billion of NOLs and/or the approximately $1.1 billion of Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards. Although we believe the Completion Agreement and Re-domicile Transaction should provide sufficient protection of our NOLs and/or Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards, there can be no assurance that an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes will not occur in the future. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Although our NOLs continue to have full valuation allowances, such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact our financial condition and the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to holders of our ordinary shares if declared by our board of directors.\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted, and all of our assets are owned, by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, or indentures, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur ability to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate and increase cash flow, and our access to additional liquidity sources. Our ability to generate and increase cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u2022the transfer of funds from subsidiaries in the U.S. to certain foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher raw material costs;\n\u2022the selling price of our products;\n\u2022our ability to adequately deliver customer service and competitive product quality;\n\u2022the impact of competition from other chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies;\n\u2022general world business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn and the significant downturn in housing construction and overall economies;\n\u2022the effects of governmental regulation on our business;\n\u2022tariff, trade duties and other trade barriers; and\n\u2022political and social instability.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. A general economic downturn can result in reduced spending by customers, which will impact our revenues and cash flows from operating activities. At reduced performance, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our existing debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business, as well as impact our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $3.0 billion. Our credit facilities contain covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022complete asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u2022make investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022fund additional dividends or repurchase shares.\nCertain of our indebtedness facilities and senior notes include requirements relating to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to indebtedness or certain fixed charges. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations (and cross-defaults to certain other debt obligations) and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger other cross defaults under other existing or future agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our credit facilities, and could force us to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nAdditionally, the interest rates on our existing Term Loan Facility (as defined elsewhere in this Form 10-K) is tied to LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, and such capital expenditure projects may not realize expected investment returns.\nOur business is capital intensive, and our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our manufacturing operations and invest in those operations to expand capacity and remain competitive from a cost perspective. We may require additional capital in the future to finance capital investments, including any potential expansion or optimization of existing production facilities or mining operations, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. Additionally, we entered into the Option Agreement with AMIC pursuant to which AMIC granted us an option to acquire 90% of a SPV, to which AMIC\u2019s ownership in the Slagger in The Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries in the KSA will be contributed together with $322 million of indebtedness currently held by AMIC. Upon exercise of the Option or Put, there can be no assurance that we may assume this indebtedness and may need to obtain funding to repay it. In the event we require any additional financing, such financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to maintain, expand or lower the operating costs of our facilities or take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Additionally, if we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our operating entities outside the U.S. are reported in various foreign currencies, primarily the South African Rand, Australian Dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling and Brazilian Real and then converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. As a result, any volatility of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies creates uncertainty for, and may have a negative impact on, reported sales and operating margin. In addition, our operating entities often need to convert currencies they receive for their products into currencies in which they purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In order to manage this risk, we have, from time to time, entered into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies.\nOur flexibility in managing our labor force may be adversely affected by labor and employment laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, many of which are more onerous than those of the U.S.; and some of our labor force has substantial workers' council or trade union participation, which creates a risk of disruption from labor disputes and new laws affecting employment policies.\nLabor costs constituted approximately 28% of our production costs (excluding ore cost) in 2019. The vast majority of our employees are located outside the U.S. In most of those countries, labor and employment laws are more onerous than in the U.S. and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment. Moreover, many of our workforce outside the U.S. belong to unions and/or are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. As such, in such jurisdictions we are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs, achieving synergies from the Cristal Transaction and responding to market changes.\nGiven the nature of our chemical, mining and smelting operations, we face a material risk of liability, production delays and additional expenditures from environmental and industrial accidents.\nOur business is exposed to, among other things, environmental hazards and industrial accidents the occurrence of which could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and results of operations of a particular manufacturing facility or on our business as a whole. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns resulting from any such environmental hazard or industrial accident, the relevant facility may not become fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. Over our operating history, we have incurred incidents of this nature. If any of the equipment on which we depend were severely damaged or were destroyed by fire, flooding, or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair it in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and ship our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures and deterioration of assets may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns or additional expenditures.\nOur operations depend upon critical equipment that require scheduled upgrades and maintenance and may suffer unanticipated breakdowns or failures. As a result, our mining operations and processing plants may be interrupted or curtailed by equipment failures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, assets critical to our mining and chemical processing operations may deteriorate due to wear and tear or otherwise sooner than we currently estimate. Such deterioration may result in additional maintenance spending and additional capital expenditures. If these assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, and we are not able to refurbish them or procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nWe rely on information technology systems across our operations, including internal and external communications, and the management of our accounting, finance, and supply chain functions. Our information technology is provided by a combination of internal and external services and service providers. Further, our business involves the use, processing, storage and transmission of information about customers, suppliers and employees using such information technology systems. Our ability to effectively operate our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems.\nLike most major corporations, we may become the target of cyberattacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks, from time to time. For instance, the Cristal business we acquired in April 2019 was subject to a significant cybersecurity attack in 2017. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative\nmedia attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which may be material.\nWe have put in place security measures designed to protect against cyberattacks, security breaches and misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of our operations. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent cyberattacks and other security breaches and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and those of various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cU.K. Bribery Act\u201d), as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our global operations may expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive, and damaging to our reputation. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and procedures, there can be no guarantee that these policies, procedures, and training will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future. Additionally, we face a risk that our distributors and other business partners may violate the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or similar laws or regulations. Such violations could expose us to FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act liability and/or our reputation may potentially be harmed by their violations and resulting sanctions and fines.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to use of natural resources, pollution, protection of the environment, mine site remediation, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes among other materials. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several and/or strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot be certain that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party.\nThe costs of compliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or the inability to obtain, update or renew permits required for operation or expansion of our business could reduce our results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with the conditions of our permits governing the production and management of regulated materials, mineral sands mining licenses or leases or the provisions of the relevant jurisdictional laws in which we operate, these permits, mining licenses or leases and mining rights could be canceled or suspended, and we could be prevented from obtaining new mining and prospecting rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use, or chemicals or mineral products we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event.\nChanges to existing laws governing operations, especially changes in laws relating to transportation of mineral resources, the treatment of land and infrastructure, contaminated land, the remediation of mines, tax royalties, waste handling and management, exchange control restrictions, environmental remediation, mineral rights, ownership of mining assets, or the rights to prospect and mine may have a material adverse effect on our future business operations and financial performance. There is risk that onerous conditions may be attached to authorizations in the form of mining rights, water-use licenses, miscellaneous licenses and environmental approvals, or that the grant of these approvals may be delayed or not granted.\nThe classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen in the European Union could result in more stringent regulatory control with respect to TiO2.\nIn May 2016, France\u2019s competent authority under the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) submitted a proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (\u201cECHA\u201d) that would classify TiO2 as carcinogenic in humans by inhalation. In February 2020, the European Commission adopted a regulation classifying the powder form of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen by inhalation. The labelling regulation will come into effect 18 months after adoption, approximately in June 2021. The classification of our products as a Category 2 Carcinogen could impact our business by inhibiting the marketing of products containing TiO2 to consumers, and subject our manufacturing operations to new regulations that could increase costs. The recent classification and labelling requirements imposed by the European Commission could have additional effects under other EU laws (e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives) and/or trigger heightened regulatory scrutiny in countries and local jurisdictions outside the EU based on health and safety grounds. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny would lead to claims by consumers or those involved in the production of such products alleging adverse health impacts.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims, including disputes with competitors, customers, equipment vendors, environmental groups and other non-governmental organizations, and providers of shipping services. Some of the lawsuits may seek fines or penalties and damages in large amounts, or seek to restrict our business activities. Because of the uncertain nature of any litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or whether insurance claims may mitigate any damages to us. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 20 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further information regarding our commitments and contingencies.\nWe compete with other mining and chemical businesses for key human resources in the countries in which we operate, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire highly skilled employees or if our key officers or employees discontinue employment with us.\nWe compete with other chemical and mining companies, and other companies generally, in the countries in which we operate to attract and retain key human resources at all levels with the appropriate technical skills and operating and managerial experience necessary to continue operating and expanding our businesses. These operations use modern techniques and equipment and accordingly require various types of skilled workers. The success of our business will be materially dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our key officers and skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees may cost us in terms of higher labor costs or reduced productivity. As a result, we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees. Should we lose any of our key personnel or fail to attract and retain key qualified personnel or other skilled employees, our business may be harmed and our operational results and financial condition could be affected.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets and on our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. If we fail to keep pace with any evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, new technologies or processes have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to our products, such as new processes that reduce the amount of TiO2 or zircon content in consumer products which in turn could depress the demand and pricing for TiO2 or zircon, respectively. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets and competitive environments.\nThird parties may develop new intellectual property rights for processes and/or products that we would want to use, but would be unable to do so; or, third parties may claim that the products we make or the processes that we use infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages and/or prevent us from making, using or selling products we make or require alteration of the processes we use.\nResults of our operations may be negatively impacted if a competitor develops or has the right to use intellectual property rights for new processes or products and we cannot obtain similar rights on favorable terms or are unable to independently develop non-infringing competitive alternatives. Similarly, results of operations may also be negatively impacted if third parties\nassert that the products we make or made or the processes that we use or used infringe or infringed their intellectual property rights.\nAlthough there are currently no pending or threatened proceedings or claims known to us that are material relating to alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the future in which third parties allege that their patents or other intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by us or our products or processes. In the event that any such infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others is found, we may need to obtain licenses from those parties or substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid such infringement, misappropriation or violation. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or be able to re-engineer our products or processes successfully. Moreover, if we are found by a court of law to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from making, using or selling the infringing products or technology. We also could be enjoined from making, using or selling the allegedly infringing products or technology pending the final outcome of the suit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and found unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The protection afforded to our intellectual property varies based upon country, scope of individual patent or trademark, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, operational knowledge and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, operational knowledge or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we may be unable to determine when third parties are using our intellectual property rights without our authorization. The undetected or unremedied unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property related to our industry by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property rights, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ore resources and reserve estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, future cash costs of production and ore demand and pricing. As a result, ore resources and reserve quantities actually produced may differ from current estimates.\nThe mineral resource and reserve estimates are estimates of the quantity and ore grades in our mines based on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, as well as from feasibility studies. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the assumptions and judgments made in interpreting the geological data. The assessment of geographical characteristics, such as location, quantity, quality, continuity of geology and grade, is made with varying degrees of confidence in accordance with established guidelines and standards. We use various exploration techniques, including geophysical surveys and sampling through drilling and trenching, to investigate resources and implement applicable quality assurance and quality control criteria to ensure that data is representative. Our mineral reserves represent the amount of ore that we believe can be economically mined and processed, and are estimated based on a number of factors, which have been stated in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7, the South African Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2007 version, as amended SAMREC and the Australian code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (2012) (JORC).\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate. Factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to secure mineral rights, the sufficiency of mineralization to support mining and beneficiation practices and the suitability of the market may significantly impact mineral resource and reserve estimates. The actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. Since these mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on assumptions related to factors discussed above, we may revise these estimates in the future as we become aware of new developments. To maintain TiO2 feedstock and zircon production beyond the expected lives of our existing mines or to increase production materially above projected levels, we will need to access additional reserves through exploration or discovery.\nIf our intangible assets or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant noncash charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in share price and market capitalization, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or results of operations. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and various other foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. From time to time, we are also subject to tax audits by various taxing authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are appropriate, the final determination of any future tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions, accruals and reserves and any such unfavorable outcome from a future tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to meet some or all of our key financial and non-financial targets could negatively impact the value of our business and adversely affect our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we may announce certain key financial and non-financial targets that are expected to serve as benchmarks for our performance for a given time period, such as, projections for our future revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow. Our failure to meet one or more of these key financial targets may negatively impact our results of operations, stock price, and stockholder returns. The factors influencing our ability to meet these key financial targets include, but are not limited to, changes in the global economic environment relating to our TiO2 products and zircon, changes in our competitive landscape, including our relationships with new or existing customers, our ability to introduce new products, applications, or technologies, our undertaking an acquisition, joint venture, or other strategic arrangement, and other factors described within this Item 1A - Risk Factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nEnglish law and provisions in our articles of association may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nCertain provisions of the U.K. Companies Act 2006 (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d) and our articles of association may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. For example, our articles of association include provisions that:\n\u2022maintain an advance notice procedure for proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022provide certain mandatory offer provisions, including, among other provisions, that a shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, that acquires 30 percent or more of our issued shares without making an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative would be at risk of certain sanctions from our board of directors unless they acted with the prior consent of our board of directors or the prior approval of the shareholders; and\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a vote of the directors or by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders.\nIn addition, public limited companies are prohibited under the Companies Act from taking shareholder action by written resolution. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAlthough we do not anticipate being subject to the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, such Takeover Code may still have anti-takeover effects in the event the Takeover Panel determines that such Code is applicable to us.\nThe U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cTakeover Code\u201d) applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose registered office is in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the U.K. (or on any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (\u201cTakeover Panel\u201d) to have its place of central management and control in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the \u201cresidency test.\u201d The test for central management and control under the Takeover Code is different from that used by the U.K. tax authorities. Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place of central management and control in the U.K. by looking at various factors, including the structure of our board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.\nGiven that a majority of the members of our Board of Directors reside outside the United Kingdom, we do not anticipate that we will be subject to the Takeover Code. However, if at the time of a takeover offer, the Takeover Panel determines that we have our place of central management and control in the U.K., we would be subject to a number of rules and restrictions, including but not limited to the following: (1) our ability to enter into deal protection arrangements with a bidder would be extremely limited; (2) we might not, without the approval of our shareholders, be able to perform certain actions that could have the effect of frustrating an offer, such as issuing shares or carrying out acquisitions or disposals; and (3) we would be obliged to provide equality of information to all bona fide competing bidders.\nAs a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales, certain capital structure decisions requires approval of our shareholders, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nThe Companies Act generally provides that a board of directors of a public limited company may only allot shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convertible into shares) with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization stating the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under such authorization and specify the date on which such authorization will expire, being not more than five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. We obtained previous shareholder authority to allot additional shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally provides that existing shareholders of a company have statutory pre-emption rights when new shares in such company are allotted and issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption right to be disapplied by either shareholders passing a special resolution at a general meeting, being a resolution passed by at least 75% of the votes cast, or by inclusion of relevant provisions in the articles of association of the company. Such a disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights may not be for more than five years. We obtained previous shareholder authority to disapply statutory pre-emption rights for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain effective, but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally prohibits a public limited company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of its shareholders by ordinary resolution, being a resolution passed by a simple majority of votes cast, and subject to compliance with other statutory formalities. Such authorization may not be for more than five years from the date on which such ordinary resolution is passed. We obtained previous shareholder authority to repurchase shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (i.e., five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.K. left the E.U. (often referred to as Brexit) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. is currently in a transition period that will continue until December 31, 2020. During this period, the U.K. has effectively remained in the E.U.\u2019s customs union and single market and is continuing to follow the E.U.\u2019s rules. The U.K. and the E.U. are currently negotiating new agreements to regulate their relationship post-December 31, 2020. If both the U.K. and the E.U. agree, the transition period may be extended and it could\nremain in place for a maximum of two years until December 31, 2022. The U.K. government has said, however, that it will not seek an extension and has enacted legislation prohibiting the U.K. from extending the transition period.\nIt is expected that Brexit will impact economic conditions in the U.K. and the E.U. The future effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the E.U. or other markets. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal will affect us.\nThe consequences of Brexit, together with the significant uncertainty regarding the terms of the agreements which will govern the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. post-December 31, 2020, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. government determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate.\nDue to Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition.\nTransfers of our ordinary shares outside The Depository Trust may be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in shares in New Tronox.\nExcept for ordinary shares received by a holder deemed to be an affiliate of us for purposes of U.S. securities laws, our ordinary shares have been issued to a nominee for The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. On the basis of current law and HM Revenue and Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d) practice, no charges to U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) are expected to arise on the issue of the ordinary shares into DTC\u2019s facilities or on transfers of book-entry interests in ordinary shares within DTC\u2019s facilities.\nShareholders are strongly encouraged to hold their ordinary shares in book entry form through DTC. Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC currently do not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of title in the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in our books. However, if those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% to be paid by the transferor.\nWe have put arrangements in place such that directly held ordinary shares cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the ordinary shares has first delivered the ordinary shares to a depositary specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depositary. Any such ordinary shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depositary. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put the depositary in funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares.\nOur articles of association provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder's capacity as such and certain other matters.\nOur articles of association provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder's capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in us or seeking relief on our behalf, against us and/or the board and/or any of the directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders individually, arising out of or in connection with our articles of association or (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) otherwise. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders.\nThere may be difficulty in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our directors and management.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the U.S. The U.S. and the U.K. do not currently have a treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of any judgment of a U.S. federal or state court in the U.K. will depend on the laws and any treaties in effect at the time, including conflicts of laws principles (such as those bearing on the question of whether a U.K. court would recognize the basis on which a U.S. court had purported to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant). In this context, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the U.K. of civil liabilities based solely on the federal\nsecurities laws of the U.S. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the U.K.. An award for monetary damages under U.S. securities laws would likely be considered punitive if it did not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and was intended to punish the defendant.", "PERMNO": 91153, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TROX"}
