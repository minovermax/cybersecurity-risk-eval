RISK FACTORS\nThe regulatory climate has grown increasingly challenging to the Company\u2019s interests both domestically and internationally-Various agencies within the U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign governments continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses (or the expansion of such uses) of older chemistries, including many of the Company\u2019s products and, in some cases, have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses. The challenge of the regulatory climate is even more pronounced in certain other geographical regions where the Company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products. There is no guarantee that this climate will change in the near term or that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of these regulatory challenges.\nU.S. EPA has proposed further limitations on the continued registration of organophosphates-On September 25, 2015 the U.S. EPA published in the Federal Register draft human health risk assessments for four of the Company\u2019s organophosphate (\u201cOP\u201d) compounds (marketed under the names Bidrin, Counter, Folex and Mocap) in which it recommends the application of a 10X safety factor under the FQPA (Food Quality Protection Act) in light of the alleged possibility of neurodevelopmental harm to women and children based on epidemiological data. The agency is seeking public comment on these risk assessments and has indicated its current intention to apply this safety factor to all registered OPs, as they come up for review or renewal. There are at least 10 other companies that have OP products which are sold (and used) in the U.S. The Company, like many in our industry, believes that the basis for applying this safety factor is unsound and that there is no causal link between the perceived harm and the use of its products. Accordingly, the Company intends to take all action necessary to defend its registrations. It is expected we will be joined in this effort by other companies who are similarly concerned about the potential impact of U.S. EPA\u2019s action. Further, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s actions will alter the course that U.S. EPA has proposed and, if the agency\u2019s position becomes final, some uses of the company\u2019s OP products could be limited or cancelled. Such action could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial performance in future reporting periods.\nAMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nUse of the Company\u2019s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups-Use of agrochemical products, including the Company\u2019s products is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal and state statutes, including FIFRA, the Food Quality Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Water Act, to name a few. These challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the U.S. EPA and/or other federal or state agencies, the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions, the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the Company\u2019s interests, and/or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by U.S. EPA in the course of registration, re-registration or label expansion. It is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed, resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe distribution and sale of the Company\u2019s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation-The Company\u2019s products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling of its products. The labeling requirements restrict the use of, and type of, application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less available, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s products are subject to the U.S. EPA, and similar agencies in the jurisdictions in which we do business, registration and re-registration requirements, and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. Such registration requirements are based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions. All states, where any of the Company\u2019s products are used, also require registration before our products can be marketed or used in that state. Governmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the Company\u2019s products. The Company, on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants, has and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S. EPA or similar agencies will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future. The Company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance.\nThe manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products is subject to governmental regulations-The Company currently owns and operates three manufacturing facilities in Los Angeles, California; Axis, Alabama; and Marsing, Idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in Hannibal, Missouri (the \u201cFacilities\u201d). The Facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company\u2019s products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company\u2019s manufacture of one or more of its products, and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner.\nThe Company may be subject to environmental liabilities-While the Company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment and its workforce, federal and state authorities may nevertheless seek fines and penalties for any violation of the various laws and governmental regulations. In addition, while the Company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials. Further, these various governmental agencies could, among other things, impose liability on the Company for cleaning up the damage resulting from the release of pesticides and other agents into the environment, including with respect to subsurface environmental contamination at its Los Angeles-based manufacturing facility, which has been the subject of characterization, risk assessment and remediation planning for several years. In short, the Company may be held liable for significant damages or fines relating to any environmental contamination or injury, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects-Demand for the Company\u2019s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns, weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests, and customer marketing programs and requirements. Weather patterns can have an impact on the Company\u2019s operations. For example, the end user of its products may, because of weather patterns, delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season, which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability. In light of the possibility of adverse seasonal effects, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain sales performance at historical levels in any particular region.\nAMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance may be disproportionately affected by the strength or weakness of specific markets-From 2010 through 2012, the Company enjoyed dramatic growth in its corn product lines sold primarily into the Midwestern United States. By 2013, those products accounted for approximately 38% of the Company\u2019s total net sales. However, due to prolonged wet conditions in early 2013, excess inventory of corn crop inputs (including some of the Company\u2019s products) accumulated in the distribution channel. This market condition continued to affect the company\u2019s overall financial performance adversely for the full years of 2014 and 2015. Sales of the Company\u2019s corn product lines represented 19% of the Company\u2019s sales in both 2014 and 2015. There is no guarantee that Midwest crop market conditions will return to the pre-2014 historical level or that other conditions adversely affecting the market will not come about.\nThe Company is dependent upon certain sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials and active ingredients- There are a limited number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the Company in many of its products. Certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically. Further, in conjunction with the purchase and/or licensing of various product lines (including Impact\u00ae , Force\u00ae, and Scepter\u00ae), the Company has entered into multi-year supply arrangements under which such counterparties are the sole source of either active ingredients and/or formulated end-use product and, in some cases, the manufacturer has entered the market as a competitor. There is no guarantee that any or all of these sole source manufacturers will be willing or able to supply these products to the Company reliably, continuously and at the levels anticipated by the Company or required by the market. If these sources prove to be unreliable and the Company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these suppliers, it is possible that the Company will not realize its projected sales, which, in turn, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nTo the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities, the Company may experience lower profitability-The Company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value. These acquisitions have enabled the Company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors. While the Company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these facilities, our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control, including fluctuating market conditions, product life cycles, weather conditions, availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints, among other things. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities, particularly when, as is currently the case, inventory of goods manufactured by the Company are at higher-than-normal levels. There is no assurance that absorption of factory costs will improve to the point that will enable the Company to return to its historically higher levels of profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in part, upon a limited number of key employees-Within certain functions, the Company relies heavily on a small number of key employees to manage ongoing operations and to perform strategic planning. In some cases, there are no internal candidates who are qualified to succeed these key personnel in the short term. In the event that the Company was to lose one or more key employees, there is no guarantee that Company could replace them with people having comparable skills. Further, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the operation of the business.\nThe Company faces competition in certain markets from new technologies, both genetic and chemical-The Company faces competition from larger companies that market new chemistries, genetically modified (\u201cGMO\u201d) seeds and other similar technologies (e.g., RNA interference) in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the Company competes, particularly that of corn. In fact, many growers that have chosen to use GMO seeds have reduced their use of the types of pesticides sold by the Company. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from companies that market these technologies.\nThe Company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures-The Company continues to face competition from competitors throughout the globe that may enter the market through either offers to pay data compensation, or similar means in foreign jurisdictions, and then subsequently source material from countries having lower cost structures (typically India and China). These competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and, with low costs of goods, can drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain market share and pricing over generic competitors or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the Company\u2019s products in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company\u2019s larger competitors-A significant portion of the Company\u2019s products are sold to national distributors in the United States,\nAMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nwhich also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors\u2019 income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company\u2019s product lines. Further, these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines rather than the Company\u2019s. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors.\nIndustry consolidation may threaten the Company\u2019s position in various markets. The agchem industry continues to undergo significant consolidation. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have grown or are about to grow through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, these competitors will tend to realize greater economies of scale, more diverse portfolios and greater influence throughout the distribution channels. Consequently, the Company may find it more difficult to compete in many markets. While such merger activity may generate acquisition opportunities for the Company, there is no guarantee that the Company will benefit from such opportunities. Further, there is a risk that the Company\u2019s future performance may be hindered by the growth of its competitors through consolidation.\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of customers, which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers-In 2015, three customers accounted for 38% of the Company\u2019s sales. The Company\u2019s future prospects may depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers. The Company cannot guarantee that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe carrying value of certain assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets may be subject to impairment depending upon market trends and other factors-The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of certain assets, including long-lived assets, inventory, fixed assets and intangibles. Depending upon the class of assets in question, the Company takes into account various factors including, among others, sales, trends, market conditions, cash flows, profit margins and the like. Based upon this analysis, where circumstances warrant the Company may leave such carrying values unchanged or adjust them as appropriate. There is no guarantee that these carrying values can be maintained indefinitely, and it is possible that one or more such assets could be subject to impairment which, in turn, could have an adverse impact upon the financial performance of the Company.\nReduced financial performance may limit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow under its credit facility-The Company has historically grown net sales through both expansion of current product lines and acquisition of product lines from third parties. In order to finance acquisitions, where necessary, the Company has drawn upon its senior credit facility. However, the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility depends, in part, upon its satisfaction of a negative covenant that sets a maximum ratio of borrowed debt to earnings (as measured over the trailing 12 month period). There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to generate earnings necessary to ensure that it has sufficient borrowing capacity to support future acquisitions or that the lender group will amend the senior credit facility to provide for such borrowing capacity.\nDependence on the Company\u2019s banking relationship-The Company\u2019s main bank is Bank of the West, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French bank, BNP Paribas. Bank of the West has been the Company\u2019s primary bank for more than 30 years. Bank of the West is the syndication manager for the Company\u2019s loans and from time to time, acts as the counterparty on the Company\u2019s derivative transactions. In addition to Bank of the West, the syndicated banks include Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BMO Harris Financing, Inc., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Agstar Financial Services PCA and Greenstone Farm Credit Services, ACA, FLCA. The Company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via credit agencies and also has face-to-face meetings with senior management of the banks. Management believes that the Company has an excellent working relationship with Bank of the West and the other financial institutions in the Company\u2019s lender group. In light of the uncertainties in global financial markets, there is no guarantee, however, that the Company\u2019s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the Company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the Company\u2019s working capital needs.\nThe Company\u2019s growth has been fueled in part by acquisition-Over the past few decades, the Company\u2019s growth has been driven by acquisition and licensing of both established and developmental products from third parties. There is no guarantee that acquisition targets or licensing opportunities meeting the Company\u2019s investment criteria will remain available or will be affordable. If such opportunities do not present themselves, then the Company may be unable to record consistent growth in future years.\nAMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)", "PERMNO": 11144, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "AVD"}
