{"cik": "906780", "company": "EMPIRE RESORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur substantial indebtedness, and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flows is used to make principal and interest payments, fixed and percentage rent payments under the Casino Lease and the Alder Lease and meet other financial obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry or implement new business initiatives and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments.\nThe Company is highly leveraged and as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $596.0 million of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. This amount includes $446.6 million outstanding under the Term B Loan, $64.8 million outstanding under the Term A Loan, $20 million outstanding under the Bangkok Bank Loan, $15 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, $30 million outstanding under the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan and $19.6 million outstanding under equipment purchase loans. Pursuant to the Casino Lease for the parcel on which the Casino is located and the Alder Lease on which The Alder is located, we will make approximately $7.7 million of fixed rent payments in 2019. In addition, we are obligated to pay annual percentage rent equal to five percent of eligible gaming revenue (according to a formula defined in the Casino Lease) and we are obligated to pay an annual special district tax assessment of approximately $1.8 million in the aggregate under the Casino Lease and the Alder Lease in 2019. Furthermore, as of the date on which the Casino opened to the public, Montreign Operating is required to pay RWS a fee equivalent to a percentage of Net Revenue (as such term is defined in the RWS License Agreement) generated in each calendar year for its use of the RWS Licensed Marks. The Company incurred an expense of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the fee payable pursuant to the RWS License Agreement of which $0.9 million was payable at December 31, 2018. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and lease obligations and meet other financial obligations will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations, and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing the principal indebtedness, could:\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness and the payment of rent, thereby reducing our funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, Golf Course Project, debt service requirements, rent payment requirements, strategic initiatives, including the Collaboration, and other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and the Casino Lease and the Alder Lease, and any failure to comply with any of our obligations under our debt agreements or the Casino Lease or the Alder Lease, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under those agreements; or\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.\nMoreover, the Golf Course Project will continue to be capital intensive. To the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from the remaining proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and cash generated by our operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, prospects and the ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations and lease obligations.\nCurrent and future cash flow may be insufficient to service all our indebtedness, lease payment and other financial obligations. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to service our debt, make rent payments and meet other financial obligations, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, lease arrangements and other financial obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow and obtain financing pursuant to the 2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter. If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate or if competition further intensifies, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our principal indebtedness. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) is $104.1 million for 2019 and $715.0 million thereafter to maturity for our currently outstanding indebtedness under our principal debt arrangements. Our estimated lease obligations are $10.4 million for 2019 and $387.8 million thereafter to maturity for our outstanding lease arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service or debt, make rent payments and meet other financial obligations. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to meet these needs, and additional financing is not available pursuant to the 2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter or otherwise, we may be required, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nseek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022\ndelay, curtail or abandon altogether our development plans, including the Collaboration;\n\u2022\nrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nsell selected assets.\nSuch measures might be insufficient to service the indebtedness, make lease payments or meet other financial obligations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If funds are not available when needed, or available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our obligations with respect to the Golf Course Project or Collaboration. In addition, we may not be able to grow market share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe agreements governing our Term Loan Facility and other principal indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCovenants in the agreements governing our principal indebtedness restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, including from subsidiaries to Empire, repurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, including limiting our ability to borrow further capital needed to complete the Golf Course Project or implement the Collaboration, if needed;\n\u2022\ndirect a significant portion of our available cash to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our use of available cash to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Moreover, our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum first lien net leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum of consolidated capital expenditures and certain mandatory prepayments. Any default under the Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, Bangkok Bank Loan or the other principal debt agreements could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt. The ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend on the future performance of the Casino and The Alder, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nRepayment of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries currently own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and, in the case of Empire\u2019s debt, their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, if needed, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our or our other subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nDefaults under any of our principal debt arrangements could result in a substantial loss of our assets.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement. A failure to repay any of this indebtedness as it becomes due or to otherwise comply with the covenants contained in any of our principal debt agreements could result in an event of default thereunder. If not cured or waived, an event of default under any of our principal debt agreements could enable the lenders thereunder to declare all borrowings outstanding on such debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The lenders could also elect to foreclose on our assets securing such debt. Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults pursuant to the terms of our principal debt agreements. In such an event, the Company may not be able to refinance or repay all of its indebtedness, pay dividends or have sufficient liquidity to meet operating and capital expenditure requirements. Any such acceleration could cause us to lose a substantial portion of our assets and will substantially adversely affect our ability to continue our operations.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive, with many of our competitors better known and better financed than us.\nWe primarily compete directly with other hotel, resort and casino and VGM facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. The gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive and increasingly dominated by multinational corporations or Native American tribes that enjoy widespread name recognition, established brand loyalty, decades of casino operation experience, an array of amenities, high-quality management talent and a diverse portfolio of gaming assets and with substantially greater financial resources. To the extent that new casinos enter our market or hotel room capacity is expanded by others, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in our regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Additionally, in May 2018, the United States Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited single-game gambling in most states, raising the potential for increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it. The expansion of online gaming, sports betting, and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts.\nIn a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. If our competitors operate more successfully than we do, if they attract patrons away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion, if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees, if their properties are enhanced or expanded, if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business, we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our patrons could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Moreover, our inability or the inability of our subsidiaries, key personnel, significant stockholders, vendors financial sources or joint venture partners to obtain or maintain required gaming regulatory licenses, permits or approvals could prevent us from operating our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.\nGaming is a highly regulated industry that is subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances that are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, some of the licenses that we and our subsidiaries, officers, directors, principal stockholders, financial sources and vendors hold expire after a relatively short period of time and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these licenses in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the regulatory agencies. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continually renew all registrations, permits, approvals or licenses necessary to conduct our operations as intended. The regulatory environment may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, recently the U.S. Department of Justice reversed a 2011 opinion that had concluded that the Wire Act of 1961 was limited to gaming relating to sports; the Department of Justice concluded instead that certain of the Wire Act\u2019s provisions apply also to other forms of wagering activity. This interpretation may adversely affect our business operations and our ability to engage in the Collaboration. If we or our subsidiaries, financial sources or vendors do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we or such individuals or entities, may be required to divest any interest in our current or future gaming facilities or our current gaming facilities risk losing their licenses. These laws, regulations and ordinances may also affect the operations of our gaming facilities or our plans in pursuing future projects. Any adverse developments in the regulation of the gaming industry in New York State could be difficult to comply with and could significantly increase our costs, which could cause our operations to be unsuccessful.\nChanges in the laws, regulations, and ordinances (including local laws) to which our gaming operations are subject, and changes in the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to our operations, may adversely affect our results of operation.\nCasino gaming is still a relatively new industry in New York and many of the rules and regulations governing casino gaming are still evolving and subject to interpretation. Under the Gaming Act, the NYSGC has extensive authority to regulate gaming activities. The NYSGC also has the authority to interpret the Gaming Act, which has far-reaching effect on our business decisions. For example, the NYSGC decides whether a gaming option available at the Casino constitutes a slot machine or table game and that decision impacts the choices we make on laying out the gaming floor. Certain provisions of the gaming regulations that have significant impact on our operations, such as the allowance for free play, are promulgated by the NYSGC and not established by the Gaming Act. The NYSGC has further discretion to deviate from the established free play allowance and to revoke such deviation at any time. Moreover, lack of visibility into the applicability of, and the expense related to complying with, specific licensing requirements and background investigations means we are unable to pass on these costs to vendors and employees and thereby reduce our costs of operation. The uncertainty surrounding the evolving interpretations of the Gaming Act and the regulations promulgated by the NYSGC may hinder our ability to negotiate agreements with third parties, such as a vendor or a junket enterprise, and establish policies relating to our workforce because we are unable to effectively judge the relative costs and benefits of these relationships. These new or changing regulations and interpretations of the Gaming Act, as well as the uncertainty of the NYSGC's further actions with respect to such regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew York State could grant additional Gaming Facility Licenses in our area or in New York City or the surrounding counties earlier than the expected seven-year blackout period, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nThe Gaming Act provides for the award of up to four Gaming Facility Licenses in three regions of upstate New York, including our area, and prohibits the issuance of Gaming Facility Licenses in the \u201cdownstate\u201d region, which includes New York City and its surrounding counties. The award of such a Gaming Facility License is intended to be exclusive for a period of seven years commencing on the date of our award of the Gaming Facility License, which occurred in December 2015. We can provide no assurance that the New York State government will not change this law and issue additional Gaming Facility Licenses before the expiration of this seven-year exclusivity period. We expect the pressure on the New York State government to issue additional licenses before the seven-year exclusivity period will intensify as larger, well-established competitors, like MGM Resorts International, enter the New York market. If the New York State government were to allow additional competitors to operate in our area or in other regions of New York through the grant of additional Gaming Facility Licenses, we would face additional\ncompetition, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nWe expect that competition from internet gaming will continue to grow and intensify.\nWe expect that we will face increased competition from internet gaming as the potential for legalized internet gaming continues to grow. Several states have authorized internet gaming and Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have entered into an agreement which allows internet poker operators to pool players with partner sites in those states. New Jersey casinos also participate in intrastate internet gaming. Our ability to compete in a marketplace containing multiple virtual casino platforms and monetize the Collaboration will depend on our ability to effectively market our gaming products to our patrons in the face of stiff competition as well as the availability of internet gaming in New York State. Currently, online gaming is not permitted in New York State and it is unclear when online gaming will be permitted, if at all. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their patrons to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert patrons from the Casino and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. There have also been proposals that would specifically legalize internet gaming under federal law.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of global economic conditions.\nConsumer demand for resort casinos, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to changes in the global economy, which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general global economic conditions, high unemployment, weakness in housing or oil markets, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, an economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the global economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism have in the past and could in the future reduce patron demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nThe loss or a reduction in the play of our most significant patrons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these patrons reside could cause a reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these patrons.\nAlso, consumer demographics and preferences may evolve over time, which, for example, has resulted in growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and react to those trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to greater risks than a geographically diverse company.\nOur operations are limited to the Catskills region of New York State, which has been affected by a decades-long decline in economic conditions. The majority of the patrons for our Casino come from the New York metropolitan area. As a result, in addition to our susceptibility to adverse global and domestic economic, political and business conditions, any economic downturn in the Catskills region or the New York metropolitan area could have a material adverse effect on our operations. An economic downturn would likely cause a decline in the disposable income of consumers, which could result in a decrease in the number of patrons at our facilities, the frequency of their visits and the average amount that they would be willing to spend at our facilities. We are subject to greater risks than more geographically diversified gaming or resort operations, including:\n\u2022\na downturn in national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nan increase in competition in New York State or the northeastern United States and Canada, particularly for day-trip patrons residing in the New York metropolitan area, including as a result of other gaming and entertainment operations in New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania;\n\u2022\nimpeded access due to road construction or closures of primary access routes; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural and other disasters in the northeastern United States.\nThe occurrence of any one of the events described above could cause a material disruption in our business and make us unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our obligations.\nWe depend on our skilled employees and key personnel and the loss of their services would adversely affect our operations and business strategy.\nThe operation of our businesses requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming, hospitality and horse racing industry experience and qualifications to enable such individuals to obtain and maintain the requisite licenses and approvals from the NYSGC. We also place substantial reliance on the gaming, project development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the northeastern United States gaming market possessed by members of our senior management team. If we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new skilled employees with high levels of expertise in the gaming areas in which we engage and propose to engage, or are unable to do so without unreasonably increasing our labor costs, the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the continued employment of our executive management and the hiring of strategic personnel at reasonable costs. Competition for skilled employees and qualified executives is intense and we can give no assurance that we would be able to hire a qualified replacement with the required level of experience and expertise for any current members of our senior management, if required to do so. Accordingly, if any of our current key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, or we were unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, recruiting and hiring a replacement for any skilled employees or executive management position could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses.\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages, labor problems and unexpected shutdowns may limit our operational flexibility and negatively impact our future profits.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.As of December 31, 2018, approximately 80% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe addition of new or changes to the existing collective bargaining agreements could cause significant increases in labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements or other unions could seek to organize groups of employees at our properties that are not currently represented by unions. Union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our businesses and result in significant costs. we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. Any unexpected shutdown of our properties from a work stoppage or strike action could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Moreover, strikes, work stoppages or other job actions could also result in adverse media attention or otherwise discourage patrons, including convention and meeting groups, from visiting our properties. We cannot assure that we can be adequately prepared for labor developments that may lead to a temporary or permanent shutdown of any of our properties.\nWe often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. The casino credit we extend is generally unsecured and due on demand. We will extend casino credit to those patrons whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension. The collectability of receivables from international patrons could be negatively affected by future business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these patrons reside.\nWhile gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \"marker,\" are enforceable under the current laws of New York, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the United States under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the United States of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. We cannot assure that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. Changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nWe face the risk of fraud and cheating.\nOur gaming patrons may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWin rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played, the amount of time played and undiscovered acts of fraud or cheating. Our gross gaming revenues are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming patrons. Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming patrons.\nIn addition, premium gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.\nOur table games business is subject to volatility which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nTable gaming, especially high-end table gaming, is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in table games hold percentage may have a positive or negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating results. Negative variations in quarterly revenues and operating results could adversely affect our financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could hard our business and results of operations.\nOur properties are located in an area that may be subject to extreme winter weather conditions. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our property and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities during these times. Such weather conditions may discourage potential patrons from traveling or may deter or prevent patrons from reaching our facilities and may cause visits to our properties to decrease for an indefinite period. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and ability to meet our financial obligations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our patrons may result in reduced visitation to Resorts World Catskills and Monticello Casino and Raceway and a reduction in our revenues.\nNegative conditions affecting the lodging industry may have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows.\nWe depend on revenues generated from our hotel, together with revenues generated from other portions of the facilities, to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations. Revenues generated from our hotel are primarily subject to conditions affecting our gaming operations, but are also subject to the lodging industry in general, and as a result, our financial performance and cash flows may be affected not only by the conditions in the gaming industry, but also by those in the lodging industry. Some of these conditions are as follows:\n\u2022\nchanges in the local, regional or national economic climate, including economic recessions;\n\u2022\nchanges in local conditions such as the supply of hotel properties;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the level of demand for hotel rooms and related services;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of our hotel to patrons;\n\u2022\ncyclical over-building in the hotel industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in travel patterns;\n\u2022\npublic health concerns affecting public accommodations or travel generally or regionally; and\n\u2022\nchanges in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors.\nWe are required to comply with extensive non-gaming laws and regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe deal with significant amounts of cash in the operations and will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. We cooperate with all such inquiries. Any violation of AML laws or regulations, on which in recent years governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have implemented internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to educate employees about applicable regulation and deter prohibited practices. However, such policies, procedures and programs may not be effective in prohibiting our directors, employees, vendors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our directors, employees, vendors or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, Montreign Operating was required to obtain credit ratings for its debt offering. Although the maintenance of a certain credit rating is not a condition to the availability of the Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility, an adverse change in this credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could adversely affect our business. Such ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action. For example, such ratings could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe credit rating for the Term Loan Facility was downgraded in 2018 and the Company's rating outlook is negative. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities further downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a \"watch list\" for a possible downgrade or lowering, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding in the future, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, among other obligations.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness and lease commitments, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness and lease commitments at any time and from time to time in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our principal indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness and lease commitments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional capital to expand our businesses.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to finance our plans for growth. Instability and volatility in the financial markets caused by general economic conditions or otherwise may impede our ability to raise capital in the public or private credit or equity markets to fund our business strategy on terms we believe to be reasonable, if at all. Meanwhile, existing indebtedness, such as the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur debt at all. Moreover, we may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. An inability to obtain the capital we need to finance our growth plans may adversely effect our operations and business prospects.\nWe may be subject to environmental liability as a result of unknown environmental hazards.\nWe are subject to various federal, New York State and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations and the construction of the Development Projects, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations\ncould result in regulatory fines, legal fees and costs for remediation. Such fines and costs could be related to our storage, handling and disposal of waste from our racing operations, the existence of asbestos-containing material at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the existence of environmental conditions at the site of the Development Projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cybersecurity risk including misappropriation of patron information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit patrons' personal and/or financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business.We have taken steps designed to safeguard our patrons' personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the payment card industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of patrons or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our operations. Cyber attacks against companies have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.\nWe collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by various jurisdictions. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California has enacted a new privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which takes effect in 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States.\nCompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient.\nRisks Relating to the Development Projects\nConstruction of the Development Projects, some of which is still ongoing, is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe construction of large-scale projects such as the Development Projects can be dangerous. Construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting the contractor and us to liabilities, possible losses, delays in completion of the projects and negative publicity. In the event of such accidents, we may stop construction for several days to allow for safety inspections and investigations. We and our contractors will take safety precautions that are consistent with industry practice, but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injuries or further loss of life, damage to property or delays. If such accidents occur, we may be subject to delays, including delays imposed by regulators, liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance, and our business, prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe costs associated with the Development Projects may increase due to risks inherent in the design and development of such projects and their construction.\nThe costs associated with the Development Projects may increase due to factors including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory and environmental problems. We could also experience:\n\u2022\nchanges to plans and specifications, even after the opening of such facilities;\n\u2022\ndelays and significant cost increases;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ninability to meet MWBE participation goals;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses;\n\u2022\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of the Development Projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of the Development Projects, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to require additional external financing.\nThe Casino and The Alder have limited operating history and the Golf Course has no operating history. Our expectations for the operations of such properties may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results and prospects.\nThe Casino has limited historical information and The Alder opened in January 2019. There is no historical information about the Golf Course Project, which is still under development. As a result, you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as a company that recently began operating a major new development project and gaming business in a rapidly growing and intensely competitive market.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies developing a major new project, and those risks and difficulties may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as the gaming market in the northeastern United States. Some of the risks relate to our ability to:\n\u2022\nattract and retain patrons and qualified employees;\n\u2022\noperate, support, expand and develop our operations and our facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses;\n\u2022\ndevelop and maintain internal personnel, systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming business;\n\u2022\nrespond to changes in our regulatory environment; and\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive market conditions.\nIf we are unable to complete any of these tasks, we may be unable to complete and operate the Casino, The Alder and, when completed, the Golf Course Project, in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues in the amounts and by the times we anticipate. If any of these events were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEven if the Casino, The Alder and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned and opened, they may not be financially successful, which would limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to repay our debt.\nEven if the Casino, The Alder and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned, one or more still may not be a financially successful venture or generate the cash flows that we anticipate. We cannot assure that the level of consumer demand for the Casino or for the type of luxury amenities that we offer will meet our expectations, and we may not attract the level of patronage that we are seeking. If the Casino, The Alder or the Golf Course Project do not attract sufficient business, this will limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service payments under our debt agreements. If any of these issues were to occur, it could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and if we are not able to build, maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our market will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into the RWS License Agreement, pursuant to which RWS granted to Montreign Operating the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited to right to use certain \u201cGenting\u201d and \u201cResorts World\u201d trademarks. Building, maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive.\nWe consider the Resorts World brand name under which we market our facility, property and services to be important to our business since it has the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract patrons to our facilities. We anticipate the possibility that income generated from high-end gaming patrons can cause variability in our results.\nRisks Relating to our Ownership Structure\nStockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because our major stockholder owns a large percentage of our common stock.\nKien Huat is the beneficial holder of 28,914,606 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 84.0% of our voting power as of March 14, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Kien Huat 2018 Preferred Stock Commitment Letter, Kien Huat currently holds 320 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, which are convertible into an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of common stock, as of March 14, 2019. If Kien Huat exercised such conversion option, Kien Huat's common stock holdings would increase to to 30,514,606 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 88.6% of our voting power as of March 13, 2019.\nUnder the terms of an investment agreement dated November 12, 2009 (the \"2009 Investment Agreement\"), Kien Huat is entitled to recommend three directors candidates whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board. Kien Huat will continue to be entitled to recommend three directors candidates for so long as it owns at least 24% of our voting power outstanding at such time, after which the number of directors whom Kien Huat will be entitled to designate for election to our Board will be reduced proportionally to Kien Huat\u2019s percentage of ownership. Under the 2009 Investment Agreement, for so long as Kien Huat is entitled to recommend nominees to serve as Board members, among other things, Kien Huat will have the right to nominate one of its director designees to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Emanuel Pearlman has been appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board pursuant to Kien Huat\u2019s recommendation. Until such time as Kien Huat ceases to own capital stock with at least 30% of our voting power outstanding at such time, our Board will be prohibited under the terms of the Investment Agreement from taking certain actions relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters without the affirmative vote of the directors recommended by Kien Huat and elected by shareholders. Consequently, Kien Huat has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of our Board and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as approving amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets, as well as other matters. Although Kien Huat has expressed no interest in doing so, Kien Huat is not restricted from acquiring additional shares\nof our common stock, including through open market purchases. However, on February 17, 2016, and as amended on December 28, 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Kien Huat (the \"Kien Huat Letter Agreement\"), wherein Kien Huat agreed, for a period of four years from the date of the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, to seek certain approvals of the Board and minority shareholders in connection with any \"going-private\" transaction. Notwithstanding the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, this concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company on terms that other stockholders may desire or force the sale of our company on terms undesirable to other stockholders.\nRisks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. If the NYSGC believes a stockholder does not meet its subjective determination, a stockholder may be forced to sell any stock they hold and such sale may result in a material loss of investment value for the stockholder.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. A failure to possess such qualifications could lead to a material loss of investment by either us or our stockholders, as it would require divestiture of the stockholder\u2019s direct or indirect interest in us. Consequently, should any stockholder ever fail to meet the qualifications necessary to own a direct or indirect interest in us as determined by NYSGC, such stockholder could be forced to liquidate all interests in us. Should such stockholder be forced to liquidate these interests within a relatively short period of time, such stockholder would likely be forced to sell at a discount, causing a material loss of investment value.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, illiquid and volatile. For instance, between January 1, 2018 and March 14, 2019, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $6.42 and $30.90 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nquarter-to-quarter variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nday traders;\n\u2022\nadverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for the gaming industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the past three fiscal years, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement, neither Empire nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to declare or pay any dividends or make other payments to purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any capital stock of the Company. Such restriction will lapse upon the payment in full of any amounts outstanding under the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement. We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. There can be no assurance that we will have, at any time, sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline.\nA portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers and a significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by Kien Huat, our largest stockholder. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a prearranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the 2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter , or the perception that such sales are likely to occur could affect the market price of our common stock. Kien Huat\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nRisks Relating to our Racing Operations\nThe continuing decline in the popularity of horse racing, decline of the horse population and increasing competition in simulcasting could adversely impact the business of Monticello Casino and Raceway.\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering at live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other forms of gaming, unwillingness of guests to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off-track wagering. The declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets. The industry-wide focus on inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated approximately $2.9 million of revenues from the import and export simulcasting of out-of-state racing, of which approximately $1.4 million in each year was due to the horsemen. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, continued decline in the horse population and available drivers, as well as increased competition in the inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets, could lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at Monticello Casino and Raceway. Our business plan anticipates the possibility of Monticello Casino and Raceway attracting new guests to our racetrack wagering operations through VGMs in order to offset the general decline in raceway attendance. However, even if our VGM operations attract new guests to our racetrack, we may not be able to generate profit from operations. Public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change. Any further decline in interest in horse racing or any change in public tastes may adversely affect our revenues and, therefore, limit our ability to make a positive contribution to our results of operation.\nRisks Relating to the Collaboration\nThere can be no assurance that the New York State will enact regulations and/or laws allowing the offering of the bet365 Sportsbook Services or the bet365 Gaming Services, in which case we may never sell additional shares to bet365 under the Collaboration Agreement or otherwise generate any Collaboration Revenues from the Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Gaming Act provides, among other things, that sports betting at gaming facilities such as the Casino is unlawful unless there has been a change in federal law authorizing such activity or upon ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction that such activity is lawful. In May 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, was unconstitutional. Therefore, upon the enactment of relevant regulations by the NYSGC, the Company may implement sports betting as part of the gaming experience at the Casino. In addition, if the State of New York enacts laws during the term of the Collaboration Agreement allowing the offering of the bet365 Online Gaming Services, the Company may participate with bet365 in offering online sports betting and online casino games. We can provide no assurance that the NYSGC will enact such regulations enabling the bet365 Sportsbook Services, that New York State will legalize the bet365 Gaming Services or such regulations and legislation will be enacted during the term of the Collaboration Agreement. Unless New York State promulgates the regulations enabling the Company to offer the bet365 Sportsbook Services or any of the bet365 Gaming Services during the term of the Collaboration Agreement, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues under the Collaboration Agreement will be materially adversely affected.\nThe NYSGC may deem bet365 a person unsuitable to offering any of the bet365 Sportsbook Services or bet365 Gaming Services pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement or the bet365 Investor unsuitable to own equity interests in the Company, in which case we may never sell the shares not yet issued to bet365 under the Collaboration Agreement, we may need to repurchase the shares previously purchased by bet365 pursuant to the terms of applicable gaming laws and our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and we may never generate any Collaboration Revenues from the Collaboration Agreement.\nThe ownership of equity interest in the Company and the management and operation of gaming services are subject to extensive state laws and regulations administered by the NYSGC. These laws and regulations concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, the licenses, permits and approvals generally expire after a relatively short period and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these licenses, permits and approvals in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the NYSGC. If bet365 or bet365 Investor do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we may never sell the shares not yet issued to bet365, we may need to repurchase the shares previously purchased by bet365, and we may never generate any Collaboration Revenues from the Collaboration Agreement. If, after receipt of a license, permit or approval bet365 or bet365 Investor are required to divest their interest in the Company or the operation of the bet365 Sportsbook Services or bet365 Gaming Services, we risk losing our Gaming Facility License unless such divestiture occurs.\nFollowing the receipt of approval of bet365 Investor's ownership of the shares or the enactment of the regulations and/or laws necessary to enable the offering of the bet365 Sportsbook Services and/or the bet365 Gaming Services, bet365 may determine the Collaboration Agreement is not commercially viable, in which case it may terminate the Collaboration Agreement. If bet365 terminates the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to this right, the Company\u2019s ability to offer commercially competitive sports betting and online gaming services may be materially adversely affected.\nFollowing the enactment of the regulations and/or laws necessary to enable the offering of the bet365 Sportsbook Services and/or the bet365 Gaming Services, the parties will monitor and assess such applicable gaming laws that affect the transactions contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement. To the extent that bet365 has a good faith concern that, as a result of provisions of the applicable gaming regulations and/or laws, the obligations of bet365 under the Collaboration Agreement will not be commercially viable, then the parties will discuss in good faith and engage in advocacy efforts to modify the applicable gaming laws. If in bet365\u2019s good faith opinion it will not be commercially viable to operate the bet365 Gaming Services, bet365 can terminate the Collaboration Agreement. If bet365 terminates the Collaboration Agreement, we may not be able to compete successfully for gaming customers with established sports betting or online gaming service providers, which may have a significant adverse effect on our ability to generate any revenue from sports betting or online gaming services in New York State.\nIn the event the market price or fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock will be below $20 on the Trigger Date, bet365 will receive the Preferred Distribution in the amount of the Common Stock Delta, which will reduce or delay the Company\u2019s receipt of a share of profits from the Collaboration Revenue.\nAfter all gaming taxes have been paid and the parties have recouped their costs and expenses from the Collaboration Revenue, bet365 is entitled to receive from the Collaboration Revenue a distribution equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, between $20 and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock (measured in accordance with the Collaboration Agreement) on the Trigger Date multiplied by the number of shares of common stock bet365 then holds. The Preferred Distribution, if any, will be payable from the Collaboration Revenue on a monthly basis over a period of three years. The payment of a Preferred Distribution from the Collaboration Revenue will defer and may materially adversely affect the amount of profits the Company receives from the Collaboration Revenue.\nEven if New York State enacts regulations and/or laws permitting the bet365 Sportsbook Services and/or the bet365 Gaming Services during the term of the Collaboration Agreement, the bet365 Collaboration may never be profitable for the Company.\nThere is no operating history between the Company and bet365, and the proposed transaction is highly speculative. The success of the bet365 Collaboration is dependent on the enactment by New York State of the regulations and laws required to allow the Company and bet365 to provide the products and services contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect the bet365 Collaboration and our ability to commercialize any products or services pursuant thereto. Even if the products and services contemplated by the bet365 Collaboration obtain the necessary approvals of New York State, our products and services may fail to achieve market acceptance and we may never become profitable. Even if the bet365 Collaboration achieves profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. As a result, our stockholders may never benefit from the transaction.", "PERMNO": 79790, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "NYNY"}
