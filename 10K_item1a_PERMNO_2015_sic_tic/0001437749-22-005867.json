{"cik": "1054721", "company": "BSQUARE CORP /WA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAs discussed under Item 1 of Part I, \u201cBusiness-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial but later emerge as material, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to General Business Conditions\nIf we are not successful in developing and delivering competitive product and services offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs, or if our products and services fail to gain or maintain traction with potential customers, our business would be negatively impacted.\nThroughout 2021, we continued to update our product strategy to bring to market technologies and related services that build on our history of helping our customers deploy and operate intelligent devices. While we will continue to meet customer commitments previously made, we are developing new products and services that may expand our opportunities in the IoT market. The attractiveness of these new offerings remains uncertain, as does the size of the investment required to bring them to fruition. Our strategy to focus on the IoT market is subject to a number of additional risks and the occurrence of any of them could harm our business:\n\u2022\nThe significant investment of time and financial and other corporate resources required;\n\u2022\nCustomer acceptance of our IoT-related product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nOur ability to cross sell customers;\n\u2022\nThe ROI model for IoT, which has proven to be elusive for many customers, could further delay adoption of IoT solutions by the market;\n\u2022\nBecause IoT services are a relatively new offering, the sales cycle may be longer than we anticipate, and;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to grow our IoT-related services business rapidly enough to reach profitability in 2021.\nOur marketplace is highly competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.\nThe competition in the growing market for IoT-related software and engineering services is significant. Further, we anticipate that we will encounter and attract competitive attention from a number of new software and service providers as we continue to focus on this market in 2021 and beyond, and as we expand our IoT-related service offerings. We currently face, or expect to face, competition from the following:\n\u2022\nOur current and potential customers\u2019 internal engineering and research and development departments, which may seek to provide their own IoT services and/or develop their own software solutions which could compete with our IoT-related service offerings and products;\n\u2022\nMicrosoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Advantech Co, Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc. and Dell Computer, Inc.;\n\u2022\nCloud IoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;\n\u2022\nMid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including TTTech Industrial North America, Inc. and PTC Inc.; and\n\u2022\nStartups funded to enter the IoT market, including Esper, Particle Industries, Inc., Ayla Networks, and SecuriThings.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. They may also focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our services and related software solutions, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with AWS or Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.\nNeither AWS nor Microsoft has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete with us. AWS may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is relatively low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating system software and services, including in the evolving IoT market. These systems integrators may be given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.\nThe unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic creates ongoing uncertainty for Bsquare and our customers, and for the overall global business environment.\nAs the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, a number of potential risks to our business may emerge and many affected our business and our financial results in 2021. We may face ongoing challenges selling or delivering our software and services, as our employees and many of those of our customers are still working from home, may be unable to attend company and industry events, and often face restrictions on travel and in-person meetings. Closures of manufacturing facilities and warehouses, or staffing shortages, continue to disrupt supply and distribution chains. Our customers could continue to experience a slow-down in demand for their products, decreased budgets, or delayed business initiatives, further reducing the need for our software and services. If our customers\u2019 global supply chains are disrupted because of COVID-19, they may not be able to meet demands for their end-product and they may reduce or eliminate their purchases from us for an uncertain period of time, if not permanently. Our customers may be slow to collect from their customers or otherwise face liquidity problems, which may cause delays in satisfaction of their financial obligations to us. Some of our customers may be forced to reduce their workforce through layoffs or furloughs, to cease operations temporarily, or, in extreme cases, declare bankruptcy. In those situations, disruptions to our business could range from a loss of key customer relationships to an inability to timely collect potentially significant receivables.\nWe have experienced a reduction in sales in our Partner Solutions segment since the second quarter of 2020, which we believe is primarily the result of the pandemic. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results may continue for an unknown time. The extent, depth, and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and the speed with which vaccines are manufactured, distributed, delivered, and accepted by the populace. Specifically, our customers\u2019 demand for our products is uncertain and is likely affected by disruptions in their component supply chains, their own sales cycles, their industry verticals, their ability to sell through traditional distribution channels, their ability to convene or attend employee or industry events, or other factors created and made persistent by the uncertain COVID-19 environment. The decline in Partner Solutions revenue experienced in 2021 suggests the effect of these disruptions can be significant. The lingering economic effects of COVID-19, even after resolution of the immediate public health crisis, may result in adverse conditions for our business that may impact our financial condition or results.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by changing economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nUncertain economic and political conditions in the U.S. and worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in the technology industries at large, particularly in an emerging market such as IoT. These factors could potentially result in reduced demand for our products and services as a result of constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers; purchasing delays; payment delays adversely affecting our cash flow and revenue; and difficulty in accurate budgeting and planning. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nLarge customers with significant resources may resort to litigation to recoup economic loss and other damages caused by what those customers perceive to be a deficiency in our products or a breach in our contractual arrangements.\nWe have a number of larger customers that have entered into longer-term contracts for our products and services. Further, we have actively engaged with those customers in recent months to retool our previously delivered products and to improve our previous agreements. Despite these efforts and investments, new issues may arise, or previous problems may re-occur, causing these customers to choose to initiate litigation against us. While we have no indication that these customers intend to pursue litigation, a decision to do so could cause us to incur significant defense costs, which would be significantly distracting, and may damage our reputation in our markets.\nWe may be subject to product liability, infringement or other legal claims that could result in significant cost and ongoing liabilities.\nOur software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability, infringement, and other legal claims. However, it is possible that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations. Although we have not experienced any product liability or infringement claims to date, as our business focus continues to transition to the sale of our own proprietary products, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future. There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. A product liability, infringement or other legal claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.\nStock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market price of our common stock may therefore frequently change as a result. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the high and low closing prices of our common stock were $1.83 and $0.93 per share, respectively, but in February 2021 our stock price reached an intraday high of $11.83 per share. Our stock price has at times appeared to be disassociated with our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of other factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations (including as a result of fluctuations in our revenue recognition), our ability to execute on our current growth strategy in a timely fashion, announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance of new products and services offered by us, developments in the IoT market, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts\u2019 expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel. Possible exogenous incidents and trends may also impact capital markets and our own common stock prices, including but not limited to foreign and cross border altercations, political unrest, cyberterrorism on a global scale, and increasingly disruptive weather systems.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur common stock may become the target of a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\nIn 2021, the securities of several companies experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock and buy-and-hold decisions of longer investors, resulting in what is sometimes described as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d Short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Sharp rises in a company\u2019s stock price may force traders in a short position to buy the stock to avoid even greater losses. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. We may be a target of a short squeeze, and investors may lose a significant portion or all of their investment if they purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue up to $25.0 million of common stock from time to time pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated July 2, 2021 relating to the offering of up to $25.0 million in shares under the At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement between us and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the \u201cSales Agent\u201d) (the \u201cCurrent Offering\u201d). The issuance from time to time of shares in the Current Offering, as well as the possibility that we may issue shares in future offerings, could have the effect of depressing the market price, or increasing the market price volatility, of our common stock. The number of shares we may sell, and any resulting impact on market price or volatility, is highly uncertain because we have the broad discretion regarding the number of shares we instruct the Sales Agent to sell, the market price of the common stock during the sales period, the limits we set with the Sales Agent in any applicable placement notice, and the demand for our common stock during the sales period. It is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We may not be able to sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than prevailing market prices, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than currently prevailing prices per share.\nOur common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could cause you to lose a significant portion of your investment, lead to costly litigation for us and interfere with our efforts to grow our business.\nStock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and accordingly the market price of our common stock may frequently and meaningfully change. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the high and low closing prices per share of our common stock were $1.83 and $0.93, respectively, with an intraday high of $2.00 and an intraday low $0.83 per share, and with daily trading volume at a low of 500 shares and a high of 837,100 shares. In 2021, through June 30, 2021, the high and low closing prices per share of our common stock were $8.40 and $1.44, respectively, with an intraday high of $11.83 and an intraday low of $1.40 per share, and with a daily trading volume at a low of 32,100 shares and a high of 240,691,000 shares. We have not had any recent change in our financial condition or results of operations that is consistent with the recent change in our stock price. In addition, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of other factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations (including as a result of fluctuations in our revenue), our ability to execute on our current growth strategy in a timely fashion, announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance of new products and services offered by us, developments in the IoT market, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts\u2019 expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel. Possible exogenous incidents and trends may also impact the capital markets generally and our common stock prices specifically, such as foreign and cross border altercations, political unrest, cyberterrorism on a global scale, and disruptive weather systems. The timing of your purchase of our common stock relative to fluctuations in its trading price may result in you losing all or a significant portion of your investment.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Litigation may arise out of facts and circumstances, or disclosure relating thereto, that we do not currently regard as material. For example, in 2021, we pre-released our expected financial results for the first quarter of 2021, we announced that our shareholders approved amended and restated articles of incorporation then retracted the filing, we pre-released our expected financial results for the second quarter of 2021, and we revised certain prior period financial statements due to a $77,000 error related to the recognition of certain revenues in our Edge to Cloud segment. We have also recently sold shares in the public markets during periods of volatile market activity. Such volatility may entice shareholders to challenge our disclosure, whether or not they are correct. Any litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would interfere with our ability to execute our business plan, sell our software and services, and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nBecause we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future, shareholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors in this offering for the foreseeable future.\nPrivacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services on the internet is evolving and increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information, such as the E.U.\u2019s Data Protection Directive and General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Further, laws and regulations are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the E.U.\u2019s ePrivacy Directive and ePrivacy Regulation. Country-specific laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Existing laws and regulations, as well as future requirements, could reduce demand for our products and services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our products and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards such as GDPR and CCPA may also limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers\u2019 customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our products and services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products and services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nIt might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority under our articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult. In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders. This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors. In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation\u2019s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company. The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nInvestments in new products and services may not deliver the returns that were anticipated when the development process was initiated, which will have a detrimental effect on our financial results.\nAs we bring new products and services to market, the acquisition rate, amount, and profitability of the revenue produced by these new offerings will be highly uncertain. Customers may not choose to adopt our technologies or may choose to adopt them more slowly than expected. The investment models that caused us to initiate product development efforts may have contained faulty assumptions about customer adoption rates and/or pricing. As a result, we may be required to sustain losses from product development for a longer period than expected, which could harm our financial results and diminish our ability to make additional investments in new products or in improving our existing set of products and services.\nExpected operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans may not be realized as anticipated.\nThroughout 2021, we continued our efforts to reduce unnecessary or excessive costs, with particular emphasis on personnel costs, in order to better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus. Factors which may affect the potential operating efficiencies we realize from our restructuring plans include the adverse impact of job eliminations, uncertainties associated with loss of customer and vendor confidence, potential negative impact on sales and customer service as well as factors outside of our control such as changes in the economic environment. We may not realize the anticipated benefits under our restructuring plans, which could result in additional restructuring efforts. If our restructuring plans are not successful, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nThe efforts to improve our cost structure and business outlook could result in the departure of key personnel or in costly employment-related litigation. Such outcomes would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn many areas, we now operate with single and primary points of function and expertise for some positions. Ongoing organizational adjustments, combined with the tight labor market, could cause the sudden departure of key individuals, which could in turn have a detrimental effect on our ability to innovate rapidly and serve our customers. Further, because the market for technology employment remains highly competitive, filling key vacancies may extend these negative effects. Further, employees who have had or who may have in the future their employment relationship terminated, or who are simply disgruntled with the direction of the company\u2019s strategy may decide to pursue litigation against us or may choose to disparage us in social media. These activities could damage our reputation, divert our attention from operating our business, and otherwise cause our business to suffer.\nOur international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.\nCustomers outside of North America generated approximately 14% of our total revenue in both 2021 and 2020. We currently have operations outside of North America and in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d). Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nGreater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies;\n\u2022\nLonger collection cycles than we typically experience in North America;\n\u2022\nUnfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs;\n\u2022\nCompliance with complex regulatory regimes or restrictions on import and export of our goods and services;\n\u2022\nComplex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto. Additionally, we may be subject to income, withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nLoss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions;\n\u2022\nThe impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nIncreased exposure to potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nAdded cost and administrative burden associated with creating and operating business structures in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nPotential labor costs and risks associated with employees and labor laws in other geographies;\n\u2022\nThe inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business; and\n\u2022\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As the long-term implications of Brexit become clear, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could adversely impact our operations and business in both the U.K. and the E.U.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nAs our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell our software products and services to these customers could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nDue to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell our software and services to these customers. As an example, under our current arrangements with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows IoT operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, and the European Free Trade Association. If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas to locations in which our business may be limited, we may be less able to remain competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nPast acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results and may not accrete to our revenue or other operating results or to our business generally.\nWe have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future. If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. In addition, acquisitions may not be as accretive to our revenue or other operating results as expected. To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the business, technology, market and management team of the acquisition target, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products, research and development, sales, marketing and support operations. If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners. Additionally, acquisition activities may distract management from day-to-day operations. We also may be unable to maintain consistently uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our entire business as a result, and significant additional demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources. Finally, acquired businesses may result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.\nWe could become subject to taxation in jurisdictions in which we do not believe we currently have tax nexus, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.\nWe sell in many jurisdictions across the United States. We believe we do not have nexus in most of these jurisdictions and, therefore, we believe we are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes in such jurisdictions. However, if we are determined to have tax nexus in other jurisdictions (as a result of more aggressive interpretations of nexus by taxing jurisdictions or otherwise) and we are unable to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, we anticipate that our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, we may have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes of which we are unaware, and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u2022\nchanges in share-based compensation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nThere may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law \u201cownership change.\u201d\nWe did not generate taxable income in 2021 or 2020 and, as a result, we were unable to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards with respect to such tax years. In addition, Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code restrict the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, has occurred. However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards. Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties. If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire, and retain employees with the skills and experience required by our business, our ability to compete may be harmed.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff. Recently, that competition has surpassed even historical norms and the fight for talent has expanded beyond technical roles and into virtually all areas of our company. The loss to competitors of any of our key employees, or the inability to hire, train, retain, motivate, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. Recruiting efforts, particularly for senior employees or employees with specialized skills, may be time-consuming, which may delay the execution of our plans. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees who do depart could hinder our strategic planning and execution. If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.\nOur customers face manufacturing and supply chain risks that could reduce demand for our products, harming our financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur customers purchase software products from us that are incorporated with other components into finished goods for sale into their own markets. They rely on a variety of third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers to provide raw materials, parts and sub-systems. Recent global shortages in energy, raw materials, and labor have harmed our customers' ability to acquire the necessary components for their products, which have in turn caused them to delay or cancel some of their orders with us. If our customers experience ongoing supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material shortages, part availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade barriers, natural disasters, and/or pandemics (including COVID-19), their buying patterns and volumes may continue to be volatile. As a result, our revenue, overall financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\nOur software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.\nSoftware and hardware components as complex as those needed for dedicated purpose intelligent systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products. Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work. To the extent that we repair or replace products, our expenses may increase. In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are repaired, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.\nMoreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly complex and comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on IoT hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of such third-party manufacturers and suppliers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors or defects. Errors or defects that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our IT infrastructure.\nThe proper functioning of our IT infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. Despite ongoing mitigation efforts, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtime, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery and availability of our products and services and harm our business.\nWe currently serve certain customers through third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, these systems generally could result in interruptions in the availability of our products and services. We have from time to time experienced, and may continue to experience, such interruptions, which could cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our customer attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our product and services offerings are unreliable. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for these third-party systems, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for technology or services we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. Further, third-party software and cloud platforms that we currently or may in the future utilize may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms, or may become unavailable. Any of these outcomes could significantly increase our expenses and result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until we are able to procure alternative solutions, either by developing equivalent technology or, if available, obtaining such technology through purchase or license from other third parties.\nWe do not control the operation or security of any of these hosting facilities or cloud computing platforms, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken by providers of these facilities and platforms, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities or platforms without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities or platforms could result in lengthy interruptions in or cessation of our services.\nBreaches in data security or incidents of cybercrime could damage our customers\u2019 business and our reputation, which may harm our ability to gain new customers or cause our existing customer to look to our competitors for products and services.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary data and personal information and security breaches could result in a risk of loss of this data or information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data. Because we do not control the IT security of our customers or third-party technology providers, or of the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our products and services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.\nOur software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.\nIt is difficult to determine whether our software products and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed. If we were to discover that one of our software products or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third party\u2019s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service. Similarly, third parties may claim that our software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit. Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results. In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others. However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount. Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.\nIn addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services. We may face claims of infringement or invalidity related to the software products and services we provide or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies with, substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If such license were not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.\nIf we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.\nWe sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis, such as we do with Microsoft Windows IoT and Mobile operating systems under our ODAs with Microsoft. If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be unable to continue to generate revenue from our reseller relationships or, with respect to our proprietary software and engineering services offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.\nWe rely primarily on confidentiality policies and procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property. These laws, policies and procedures provide only limited protection. It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software products and services. If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents. The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws may not be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.\nWe license our computer source code to customers. Customers with access to our source code may not comply with the license terms. We may not discover any violations of the license terms and, in the event of discovery of violations, we may not be able to successfully enforce the license terms or recover the economic value lost from such violations. To license some of our software products, we rely in part on \u201cshrink-wrap\u201d and \u201cclick wrap\u201d licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.\nA significant portion of our marks include the word \u201cBSQUARE.\u201d Other companies use forms of \u201cBSQUARE\u201d in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses. We license certain trademark rights to third parties. Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.\nThe computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Partnership with Microsoft\nWe provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft\u2019s Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems. As a result, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. The following Microsoft-related risks may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we do not maintain our distribution relationship with Microsoft as currently structured, our revenue would decrease, and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through April 30, 2022. If any of our other ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, Partner Solutions revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted. Future renewals by Microsoft, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe currently recognize revenue from the sale of Microsoft software generally upon shipment of physical software licenses. If Microsoft were to change the method of providing software licenses to a digital rather than physical medium, our revenue recognition policies may need to change, and that change in policy could result in a significant decrease in revenue. While such a change is not expected, and would not immediately impact our cash flows, the full financial scope of the impact is uncertain and potentially significantly negative.\nMicrosoft can change its product pricing at any time, and unless we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.\nFurther, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our resale activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives. If Microsoft changes the way that rebates are earned by eliminating or negatively modifying the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be adversely impacted. If we are unable to meet rebate criteria, or if the rebate criteria is modified, we may not be able to sustain the financial benefits of the rebate program and our operating results could be harmed.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes Microsoft implements in its pricing of its operating systems.\nMicrosoft has historically implemented significant pricing changes for its operating systems products and Microsoft could make further pricing changes in the future. These changes have altered the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts are available to all distributors of these Microsoft products. As a distributor of Microsoft products, this may impact both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold that we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell. Microsoft has indicated that a new version of an operating system product we frequently sell to customers will be released in the near future. While Microsoft has not indicated the pricing of this new product version, any significant declines in the market price for the product will reduce our revenue and may reduce our gross profits. The amount and impact of the change, and other pricing changes, on our revenue and gross profit are currently not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results in future reporting periods.\nMicrosoft offers certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations. While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODAs with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to offer, free of charge, operating systems that we do distribute, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nIn recent years, the markets for Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems have declined; if the markets for these operating systems continue to decline or decline more rapidly than anticipated, our business and operating results would be materially harmed.\nA significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices running various Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems. In recent years, the markets for these systems have declined. If the markets for these operating systems continue to decline or decline more rapidly than anticipated, our business and operating results would be negatively impacted. Continued market acceptance of Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nMicrosoft\u2019s development and support of various Windows IoT and Windows Mobile markets. As the developer and primary promoter of Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems, if Microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems, potential customers could select competing operating systems, which could reduce the demand for our Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile software products and engineering services, from which a significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated;\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart connected systems market, including iOS from Apple, Inc.; VxWorks and Linux from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Android from Google Inc.; QNX from BlackBerry Limited; and other proprietary operating systems. Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems may be unsuccessful in capturing or retaining a significant share of the smart connected systems market in the future;\n\u2022\nThe acceptance by customers of the mix of features and functions offered by Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems; and\n\u2022 The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems is uncertain. To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems and our revenue could decline.\nMicrosoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and may audit our records again in the future, and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of our distributor relationship with Microsoft.\nThere are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing purposes. Non-compliance with these or other contractual requirements could result in the termination of our distributor relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft conducted previous audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs, none of which had material findings. It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found. We may also be contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.", "PERMNO": 87302, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "BSQR"}
