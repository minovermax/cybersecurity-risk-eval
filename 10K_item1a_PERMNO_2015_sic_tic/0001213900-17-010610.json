Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document, particularly the discussions about regulation, competition and intellectual property. The trading price of our Class B common stock could decline due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nEach of our telecommunications lines of business is highly sensitive to declining prices, which may adversely affect our revenues and margins.\nThe worldwide telecommunications industry is characterized by intense price competition, which has resulted in declines in both our average per-minute price realizations and our average per-minute termination costs. Many of our competitors continue to aggressively price their services. The intense competition has led to continued erosion in our pricing power, in both our retail and wholesale markets, and we have generally had to pass along all or some of the savings we achieve on our per-minute costs to our customers in the form of lower prices. In the case of some international calling locations, when average per minute termination cost decline to a nominal amount, indirect competitors, such as wireless carriers, may include calls to those locations at no extra cost, which increases our risk of losing customers. For example, following regulatory changes intended to increase domestic competition in the Mexican telecommunications market, the cost of terminating international calls to Mexico declined significantly. As a result, many of our competitors, including some of the large U.S. mobile operators, began offering unlimited Mexico calling as part of their monthly pricing plans, which caused a decline in our minutes of use and revenue. In July 2016, we significantly reduced pricing on Boss Revolution\u2019s U.S. to Mexico corridor, which accelerated the decline in our revenue and gross profit.\nAny increase by us in pricing may result in our prices not being as attractive, which may result in a reduction of revenue. If these trends in pricing continue or accelerate, it could have a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our telecommunications businesses and/or our gross margins.\nBecause our Boss Revolution and other retail products generate a significant portion of our revenue, our growth and our results of operations are substantially dependent upon growth in these products.\nOur growth and our results of operations are substantially dependent upon growth in our Boss Revolution and other retail products that currently generate a significant portion of our revenue. We compete in the international prepaid calling market with Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators (or MVNOs) with aggressive international rate plans, and VoIP and other \u201cover the top\u201d (OTT) service providers.\nMany of these companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do. The use by these competitors of their resources in or affecting the international prepaid calling market could significantly impact our ability to compete against them successfully.\nIn addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers, who from time-to-time offer rates that are substantially below our rates, and in some instances below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service, to gain market share. This type of pricing by one or more competitors can adversely affect our revenues, as they gain market share at our expense, and our gross margins, if we lower rates to better compete.\nThe continued growth of Over-The-Top calling and messaging services, such as Skype, Viber WhatsApp has adversely affected the sales of Boss Revolution and our other prepaid calling services. We expect the popularity of IP-based services-many of which offer voice communications for free provided both the caller and recipient have a broadband connection-to continue to increase, which may result in increased substitution and pricing pressure on our Boss Revolution and other international prepaid calling service offerings.\nCertain wireless operators have been rolling out unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these \u201cinternational unlimited\u201d plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share.\nIf we are unable to grow our Boss Revolution and other retail products, it could have a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our telecommunications businesses, our gross margins and/or our profits.\nWe may be unable to achieve some, all or any of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our plan to separate our businesses into three separate entities.\nIn August 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to reorganize us into three separate entities by spinning off two non-core business units and certain assets, one of which was Zedge, to our stockholders, which we completed on June 1, 2016. Throughout fiscal 2017, we prepared to spin off additional non-core assets including our interests in two clinical and early stage pharmaceutical companies - Rafael Pharmaceuticals and Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - and our real estate holdings to our shareholders as Rafael Holdings, Inc. In addition, we intend to contribute $50 million to $60 million in cash to Rafael Holdings, Inc. prior to the spin-off.\nFollowing the spin-offs, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to support the development of our business for the medium term, but there can be no assurance of such liquidity. In the future, however, we may require additional financing for capital requirements and growth initiatives. Accordingly, we will depend on our ability to generate cash flows from operations and to borrow funds and issue securities in the capital markets to maintain and expand our business. We may need to incur debt on terms and at interest rates that may not be as favorable as those historically enjoyed by us. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to operate our business as planned or at all, fund our expansion, successfully promote our business, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our products and business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBy separating entities such as Zedge and Rafael Holdings, Inc. from us, there is a risk that we may be more susceptible to stock market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been due to a reduction in market diversification. We expect that the aggregate market value of the three separate companies will exceed the market capitalization of all the businesses being operated by us because investors will be able to invest in a company that they are attracted to without having to also invest in the other two companies. However, this expectation may be incorrect, and the aggregate value of the three separate companies may be less than the market capitalization of the businesses being operated by us.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient or cost-effective termination capacity to particular destinations.\nMost of our telecommunications traffic is terminated through third-party providers. In order to support our minutes-of-use demands and geographic footprint, we may need to obtain additional termination capacity or destinations. We may not be able to obtain sufficient termination capacity from high-quality carriers to particular destinations or may have to pay significant amounts to obtain such capacity. This could result in our not being able to support our minutes-of-use demands or in higher cost-per-minute to particular destinations, which could adversely affect our revenues and margins.\nThe termination of our carrier agreements with foreign partners or our inability to enter into carrier agreements in the future could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete, which could reduce our revenues and profits.\nWe rely upon our carrier agreements with foreign partners in order to provide our telecommunications services to our customers. These carrier agreements are for finite terms and, therefore, there can be no guarantee that these agreements will be renewed at all or on favorable terms to us. Our ability to compete would be adversely affected if our carrier agreements were terminated or we were unable to enter into carrier agreements in the future to provide our telecommunications services to our customers, which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits.\nAs more competitors offer international airtime top-up service, our ability to secure competitive direct or indirect, exclusive or non-exclusive, agreements with international wireless operators could become more difficult or less attractive, thereby having an adverse effect on our revenues and operations.\nOur customers, particularly our Wholesale Carrier Services customers, could experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability if we experience difficulties in collecting our receivables.\nAs a provider of international long-distance services, we depend upon sales of transmission and termination of traffic to other long distance providers and the collection of receivables from these customers. The wholesale telecommunications market continues to feature many smaller, less financially stable companies. If weakness in the telecommunications industry or the global economy reduces our ability to collect our accounts receivable from our major customers, particularly our wholesale customers, our profitability may be substantially reduced. While our most significant customers, from a revenue perspective, vary from quarter to quarter, our five largest Wholesale Carrier Services customers collectively accounted for 10.6% and 6.3% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Our Wholesale Carrier Services customers with the five largest receivables balances collectively accounted for 34.9% and 21.5% of the consolidated gross trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This concentration of revenues and receivables increases our exposure to non-payment by our larger customers, and we may experience significant write-offs if any of our large customers fail to pay their outstanding balances, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur revenues will suffer if our distributors and sales representatives fail to effectively market and distribute our Boss Revolution voice and payment services, as well as our traditional disposable calling cards.\nWe rely on our distributors and representatives to market and distribute our Boss Revolution products, our traditional disposable prepaid calling card products, our international airtime top-up offerings and other payment services. We utilize a network of several hundred sub-distributors that sell our Boss Revolution products, traditional disposable prepaid calling cards, and international airtime top-up to retail outlets throughout most of the United States. In foreign countries, we are dependent upon our distributors and independent sales representatives, many of which sell services or products for other companies. As a result, we cannot control whether these foreign distributors and sales representatives will devote sufficient efforts to selling our services. In addition, we may not succeed in finding capable distributors, retailers and sales representatives in new markets that we may enter. If our distributors or sales representatives fail to effectively market or distribute our Boss Revolution products, prepaid calling card products, international airtime top-up offerings and other services, our ability to generate revenues and grow our customer base could be substantially impaired.\nNatural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our technological infrastructure.\nNatural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. Our inability to operate our telecommunications networks because of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in loss of revenue, significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain functions related to our business depend on a single supplier or small group of suppliers to carry out our business, and the inability to do business with some or all of these suppliers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf the services of any of the single suppliers or small group of suppliers that we depend on were unavailable, or available only in decreased capacity or at less advantageous terms, this could result in interruptions to our ability to provide certain services, could cause reduction in service and/or quality as the function is transitioned to an alternate provider, if an alternate provider is available, or could increase our cost, which in the current competitive environment, we may not be able to pass along to customers.\nFor example and without limitation, the platforms that support our Hosted PBX business and our money remittance business are each leased from a third party. These platforms are susceptible to, and have incurred, service interruptions, which can occur frequently and can be lengthy in duration. Any such service interruption of the platform could effectively temporarily cease or otherwise materially impair operations of our applicable business. In addition, if these platforms became permanently unavailable for any reason, including, without limitation, because the third-party owner of such platform no longer provided the service for any reason, then our applicable business would be materially negatively affected.\nAccordingly, any of these events could materially and negatively impact our business, our revenues, our margins, and our relationships with customers.\nWe could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nTo be successful, we need to continue to have available, for our and our customers\u2019 use, a high capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber-attacks, malware, computer viruses, sabotage, or other significant disruption of our IT infrastructure and related systems. As such, there is a risk of a security breach or disruption of the systems we operate, including possible unauthorized access to our and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information. We are also subject to breaches of our network resulting in unauthorized utilization of our services or products, which subject us to the costs of providing those products or services, which are likely not recoverable. The secure maintenance and transmission of our and our customer\u2019s information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our or our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without the customers\u2019 consent, or our products and services may be used without payment.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. Certain of our business units have been the subject of attempted and successful cyber-attacks in the past. We have researched the situations and do not believe any material internal or customer information has been compromised.\nNetwork disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized use of our services or products without payment, (iii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; (iv) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems and processes; (v) subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies; or (vi) result in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation. Any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe could fail to comply with requirements imposed on us by certain third parties, including regulators.\nA significant and increasing portion of our telecom transactions are processed using credit cards and similar payment methods. The banks, credit card companies and other relevant parties impose strict system and other requirements to participate in such parties\u2019 payment systems. We are required to comply with the privacy provisions of various federal and state privacy statutes and regulations, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, each of which is subject to change at any time. Compliance with these requirements is often difficult and costly, and our failure, or our distributors\u2019 failure, to comply may result in significant fines or civil penalties, regulatory enforcement action, liability under or termination of necessary agreements related to our payment services business, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or operations and that of our distributors who could be liable as well. Further, our payment services are subject to stringent requirements by regulators and trade organizations in various jurisdictions. Our payment services unit is subject to federal and state banking regulations and we are also subject to further regulation by those states in which we are licensed as a money transmitter. We may not be able to comply with all such requirements in a timely manner or remain in compliance. If we are not in compliance, we could be subject to penalties or the termination of our rights to participate in such payment systems or provide such services, which could have a material negative impact on our ability to carry on and grow our Retail Communications and Payment Services operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe hold significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments that are subject to various market risks.\nAt July 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $148.6 million. At July 31, 2017, we also had $8.6 million in investments in hedge funds, which were included in \u201cInvestments\u201d in our consolidated balance sheet. Investments in marketable securities and hedge funds carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that we can redeem the hedge fund investments at any time and that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict the course of price movements of securities and other instruments and, in general, the securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and investments could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe plan on contributing a significant amount of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to Rafael Holdings, Inc., which we expect to spin-off to our shareholders\nAt July 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $148.6 million. Throughout fiscal 2017, we prepared to spin off additional non-core assets including our interests in two clinical and early stage pharmaceutical companies - Rafael Pharmaceuticals and Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - and our real estate holdings to our shareholders as Rafael Holdings, Inc. We intend to contribute $50 million to $60 million in cash to Rafael Holdings, Inc. prior to the spin-off, which would significantly reduce our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities holdings. This reduction in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities holdings could have a material negative impact on our ability to carry on and grow our businesses, which could result in a reduction of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory and Litigation Risks\nWe provide communications services to consumers and are therefore subject to various Federal and state laws and regulations.\nAs a provider of communications services to consumers, such as our Boss Revolution international calling service or our prepaid calling card services, we are subject to various Federal and state laws and regulations relating to the manner in which we advertise our services, describe and present the terms of our services, and communicate with our customers and consumers in general. Compliance with these laws requires us to be constantly vigilant as they often vary from state to state. Failure to comply with these laws could result in action being taken by Federal and state agencies or offices responsible for consumer protection, like the Federal Trade Commission.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe depend on proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights in conducting our various business operations. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any such litigation.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to claims and legal proceedings from third parties regarding alleged infringement by us of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. Such suits can be expensive and time consuming and could distract us and our management from focusing on our businesses. Further, loss of such suits could result in financial burdens and the requirement to modify our modes of operation, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to tax and regulatory audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing and regulatory authorities with respect to certain of our income and operations. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing entity.\nOur FCC Form 499-A filings for calendar years 2000 through 2006 related to payments to the Universal Service Fund have been audited by the Internal Audit Division, or IAD, of the Universal Service Administrative Company, or USAC, which concluded that we incorrectly reported certain revenues on Forms 499-A. USAC\u2019s revisions to our filing methodology resulted in additional regulatory payments for the years covered by the audits. While we believe in the accuracy of our filing methodology and our Request for Review remains pending, we have implemented some of the revisions set forth in the IAD\u2019s filings beginning with our calendar year 2010 Form 499-A. We have accrued for all regulatory fees we believe may be incurred under IAD\u2019s methodology from 2002 through the present, in the event our Request for Review is denied and/or our methodology is not upheld on appeal, and we have made certain payments on amounts that have been invoiced to us by USAC and/or other agencies. Our 2017 FCC Form 499-A, which reports our calendar year 2016 revenue, is currently under audit by the IAD. At July 31, 2017, our accrued expenses included $43.5 million for these regulatory fees for the years covered by the audit and subsequent years. Until a final decision has been reached in our disputes, we will continue to accrue in accordance with IAD\u2019s methodology. If we do not properly calculate, or have not properly calculated, the amount payable by us to the Universal Service Fund, we may be subject to interest and penalties.\nOn September 20, 2016, we received a letter of inquiry from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC requesting certain information and materials related to an investigation of potential violations by Straight Path Spectrum LLC (formerly a subsidiary of ours and currently a subsidiary of Straight Path) in connection with licenses to operate on the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands of the Fixed Microwave Services. As disclosed in Straight Path\u2019s filings with the SEC, Straight Path entered into a consent decree with the FCC that terminated the FCC\u2019s related investigation against Straight Path. We have cooperated with the FCC in this matter and have responded to the letter of inquiry. If the FCC were to pursue separate action against us, the FCC could seek to fine or impose regulatory penalties or civil liability on us related to activities during the period of ownership by us.\nWe are subject to value added tax, or VAT, audits from time-to-time in various jurisdictions. In the conduct of such audits, we may be required to disclose information of a sensitive nature and, in general, to modify the way we have conducted business with our distributors until the present, which may affect our business in an adverse manner.\nWe are also subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various other taxes, including utility excise tax, sales and use tax, communications services tax, gross receipts tax and property tax.\nOur business is subject to strict regulation under federal law regarding anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing. Failure to comply with such laws, or abuse of our programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nProvisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other federal laws impose substantial regulations on financial institutions that are designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of our industry with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing matters could result in more aggressive enforcement of these laws or the enactment of more onerous regulation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, abuse of our money transfer services or prepaid card programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, notwithstanding our efforts to prevent such abuse through our regulatory compliance and risk management programs, could cause reputational or other harm that would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent illegal or illicit activity and our failure, or the failure of one of our disbursement partners or payment processors to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur money transfer and network branded prepaid card services are subject to a strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements by us, our regulated retailers or our disbursement partners could result in the suspension or revocation of a money transmitter license, the limitation, suspension or termination of our services, the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines.\nThe foregoing laws and regulations are constantly evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. If we fail to update our compliance system to reflect legislative or regulatory developments, we could incur penalties. New legislation, changes in laws or regulations, implementing rules and regulations, litigation, court rulings, changes in industry practices or standards, changes in systems rules or requirements or other similar events could expose us to increased compliance costs, liability, reputational damage, and could reduce the market value of our money transfer and network branded prepaid card services or render them less profitable or obsolete.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could harm us and the scope of our activities, and could harm our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in the United States on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and substantive regulation across the financial services industry. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, whose purpose is to issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money transfer services.\nWe may be subject to examination by the CFPB, which has broad authority to enforce consumer financial laws. The CFPB has a large budget and staff and has broad authority with respect to our money transfer service and related business. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. The CFPB\u2019s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or alter past regulatory guidance, could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Counsel that is authorized to designate as \u201csystemically important\u201d non-bank financial companies and payment systems. Companies designated under either standard will become subject to new regulation and regulatory supervision. If we were designated under either standard, the additional regulatory and supervisory requirements could result in costly new compliance burdens or may require changes in the way we conduct business that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to licensing and other requirements imposed by U.S. state regulators, and the U.S. federal government. If we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing money transmitters, we could lose our licenses, be subject to liability or be forced to change our business practices.\nA number of states have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters, with 49 states requiring a license as of July 31, 2017. At July 31, 2017, we had obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in 47 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. We are also registered as money services businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to bonding requirements, liquidity requirements, restrictions on our investment of customer funds, reporting requirements and inspection by state and foreign regulatory agencies. If we were found to be subject to and in violation of any banking or money services laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability or additional restrictions, such as increased liquidity requirements. In addition, our licenses could be revoked or we could be forced to cease doing business or change our practices in certain states or jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. Regulators could also impose other regulatory orders and sanctions on us. Any change to our business practices that makes our service less attractive to customers or prohibits use of our services by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease our transaction volume and harm our business.\nOur disbursement partners generally are regulated institutions in their home jurisdiction, and money transfers are regulated by governments in both the United States and in the jurisdiction of the recipient. If our disbursement partners fail to comply with applicable laws, it could harm our business.\nMoney transfers are regulated by state, federal and foreign governments. Many of our disbursement partners are banks that are heavily regulated by their home jurisdictions. Our non-bank disbursement partners are also subject to money transfer regulations. We require regulatory compliance as a condition to our continued relationship, perform due diligence on our disbursement partners and monitor them periodically with the goal of meeting regulatory expectations. However, there are limits to the extent to which we can monitor their regulatory compliance. Any determination that our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs. While our services are not directly regulated by governments outside the United States, except with respect to our Gibraltar bank as discussed below, it is possible that in some cases we could be liable for the failure of our disbursement partners or their sub-disbursement partners to comply with laws, which also could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur bank in Gibraltar is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (the FSC), and, as such, is subject to Gibraltarian and European Union laws relating to financial institutions. As an issuer of prepaid debit cards for programs operated by other entities, commonly known as program managers, the bank is responsible, inter alia, for anti-money laundering laws oversight and compliance. If we were to fail to implement the requisite controls or follow the rules and procedures mandated by the FSC and applicable law, we could be subject to regulatory fines, and even the loss of our banking license. In fiscal 2016, a referendum took place in the United Kingdom in which a majority voted in favor of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union - commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a bank licensed in Europe, our bank in Gibraltar currently benefits from its ability to passport its license to operate in any European Union member state. However, as a British territory, if Brexit occurs, and no alternative arrangements are established with respect to licensing of British banks in the European Union, our bank in Gibraltar may not be able to passport its license into European Union member states. In 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our Gibraltar-based bank for approximately $18 million, which we expect to close in calendar 2017.\nWe receive, store, process and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store and process personal information and other customer data, including bank account numbers, credit and debit card information, identification numbers and images of government identification cards. As a result, we are required to comply with the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. There are also numerous other federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions or conflict with other applicable rules. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices.\nAdditionally, with advances in computer capabilities and data protection requirements to address ongoing threats, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against potential security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines or litigation. If there is a breach of credit or debit card information that we store, we could also be liable to the issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, a significant breach could result in our being prohibited from processing transactions for any of the relevant network organizations, such as Visa or MasterCard, which would harm our business. If any third parties with whom we work, such as marketing partners, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could harm our business. Any negative publicity arising out of a data breach or failure to comply with applicable privacy requirements could damage our reputation and cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial position and potential for growth.\nFederal and state regulations may be passed that could harm our business.\nOur ability to provide VoIP communications services at attractive rates arises in large part from the fact that VoIP services are not currently subject to the same level of regulation as traditional, switch-based telephony. The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is largely unregulated within the United States, although several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. If interconnected VoIP services become subject to state regulation and/or additional regulation by the FCC, such regulation will likely lead to higher costs and reduce or eliminate the competitive advantage interconnected VoIP holds, by virtue of its lesser regulatory oversight, over traditional telecommunications services. More aggressive regulation of the Internet in general, and Internet telephony providers and services specifically, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to offer services outside of the United States is subject to the local regulatory environment, which may be unfavorable, complicated and often uncertain.\nRegulatory treatment outside the United States varies from country to country. We distribute our products and services through resellers that may be subject to telecommunications regulations in their home countries. The failure of these resellers to comply with these laws and regulations could reduce our revenue and profitability, or expose us to audits and other regulatory proceedings. Regulatory developments such as these could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn many countries in which we operate or our services are sold, the status of the laws that may relate to our services is unclear. We cannot be certain that our customers, resellers, or other affiliates are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in their respective countries, that they or we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements, and/or that they or we will continue in compliance with any requirements. Our failure or the failure of those with whom we transact business to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we expect additional regulation of our industry in some or all of these areas, and we expect continuing changes in the regulatory environment as new and proposed regulations are reviewed, revised and amended, we cannot predict with certainty what impact new laws in these areas will have on us, if any. For a complete discussion of what we believe are the most material regulations impacting our business, see Item 1 to Part I \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nVarious legal proceedings that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of business have not been finally adjudicated, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn particular, on July 5, 2017, plaintiff JDS1, LLC, on behalf of itself and all other similarly situated stockholders of Straight Path, and derivatively on behalf of Straight Path as nominal defendant, filed a putative class action and derivative complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court against us, The Patrick Henry Trust (a trust formed by Howard S. Jonas to hold record and beneficial ownership of all of his shares of Straight Path), Howard S. Jonas, and each of Straight Path\u2019s directors. The complaint alleges that we aided and abetted Straight Path\u2019s directors and Howard S. Jonas in his capacity as controlling stockholder of Straight Path, in breaching their fiduciary duties to Straight Path in connection with the settlement of claims between Straight Path and us related to potential indemnification claims concerning Straight Path\u2019s obligations under the Consent Decree it entered into with the FCC, as well as the proposed sale of Straight Path\u2019s subsidiary Straight Path IP Group, Inc. to us in connection with that settlement. That action was consolidated with a similar action that was initiated by The Arbitrage Fund. The Plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, (i) a declaration that the action may be maintained as a class action or in the alternative, that demand on the Straight Path Board is excused; (ii) that the term sheet is invalid; (iii) awarding damages for the unfair price stockholders are receiving in the merger between Straight Path and Verizon Communications Inc. for their shares of Straight Path\u2019s Class B common stock; and (iv) ordering Howard S. Jonas, Davidi Jonas, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Straight Path, and us to disgorge any profits for the benefit of the class Plaintiffs. On August 28, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On September 24, 2017, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. We intend to vigorously defend the action.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nHolders of our Class B common stock have significantly less voting power than holders of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class B common stock are entitled to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to three votes per share. As a result, the ability of holders of our Class B common stock to influence our management is limited.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholder, which limits the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nHoward S. Jonas, our Chairman of the Board and founder, has voting power over 4,279,503 shares of our common stock (which includes 1,574,326 shares of our Class A common stock, which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 2,705,177 shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 70.8% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, as of October 10, 2017. In addition, Mr. Jonas holds an option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock, which is fully vested and exercisable. Mr. Jonas is able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management is limited.", "PERMNO": 88988, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "IDT"}
