RISK FACTORS.\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. These known and unknown risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to continue successful commercialization of AMITIZA for the approved indications and other indications or dosage forms for which we are developing this drug, or experience significant delays in doing so, our ability to generate royalty and product-based revenues and achieve profitability will be jeopardized.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful commercialization of our first product, lubiprostone. Lubiprostone was launched in the U.S. in 2006, under the brand name AMITIZA. AMITIZA is currently marketed in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan for various indications. We have a limited history of generating global revenues from the sale of lubiprostone. Our ability to meet expectations with respect to global sales of lubiprostone and revenues from such sales, and to attain profitability and maintain positive cash flow from the lubiprostone business, in the time periods we anticipate, or at all, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to continue to build, and to maintain, market acceptance for lubiprostone among healthcare professionals and patients in the U.S., and to gain such market acceptance in the countries where lubiprostone is approved, or may in the future receive approval;\n\u00b7\nthe best efforts of Takeda and Abbott to commercialize and maximize net sales revenue of AMITIZA;\n\u00b7\nthe degree to which both physicians and patients determine that the safety and side effect profiles of lubiprostone are manageable, and that the benefits of lubiprostone outweigh the risks;\n\u00b7\nthe current and future prevalence of CIC, IBS-C or CC;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of insurance companies, managed care organizations, other private payers, and government entities that provide reimbursement for medical costs in the U.S. to continue to provide reimbursement for lubiprostone at the prices at which we offer lubiprostone without imposing any additional major hurdles to access or other significant restrictions or limitations, and the ability and willingness of patients to commit to any co-pay amounts for lubiprostone applicable under their insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nour commercial partners\u2019 ability to obtain pricing approval and/or reimbursement required for selling lubiprostone in the major countries of the E.U., Japan and in other countries in which we may receive approval to market lubiprostone on a timely basis and at price levels that are acceptable to us without the applicable government agencies or other payers in such countries imposing onerous caps, rebate, risk sharing or other requirements which effectively and significantly lower the reimbursement rates for lubiprostone;\n\u00b7\nthe extent of the likely negative impact of the introduction of new competitive products on sales of lubiprostone;\n\u00b7\nour ability to gain regulatory approval of lubiprostone outside the countries in which we have already received approval without restrictions that are substantially more onerous or manufacturing specifications that are more difficult to consistently achieve than those imposed in the U.S. and E.U.;\n\u00b7\nour ability to accurately forecast revenues from sales of lubiprostone and the metrics that impact revenues, such as prescription rate, short-term and long-term drop-out rate, conversion rate, reimbursement and pricing; the timing and availability of named patient sales and the impact of future competition;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully gain approval of a dosage form of lubiprostone for pediatric functional constipation, and to generate revenues from sales of the dosage form for pediatric functional constipation, if approved;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of clinical trials of AMITIZA for the treatment of other constipation-related gastrointestinal indications beyond CIC, IBS-C and OIC as well as other dosage forms other than the 24 mcg and 8 mcg soft gelatin capsule, and successful commercialization of these indications and dosage forms within and outside the U. S.;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of R-Tech, which has the exclusive right to manufacture and supply AMITIZA, or any substitute manufacturer to manufacture sufficient bulk quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and sufficient quantities of each dosage strength and dosage form of lubiprostone to meet demand;\n\u00b7\nour ability to hire and retain key personnel necessary to optimize the lubiprostone business; and\n\u00b7\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to continue to execute effectively on our commercial launch plan and other key activities related to lubiprostone in the U.S., and to launch lubiprostone successfully in those key markets outside the U.S. in which we receive pricing and reimbursement approval, and the level of cost required to conduct such activities.\nAMITIZA faces significant competition from competitors\u2019 products like linaclotide and naloxegol, which, in addition to other factors, could in certain circumstances lead to a significant reduction in royalty revenues and product sales.\nAs a general matter, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. To be successful, we must be able to, among other things, effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products. We or our partners must be able to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical professionals. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. This enables them, among other things, to make greater investments in research and development, marketing and promotion.\nOur product, AMITIZA, faces competition from competitors\u2019 products. Specifically, AMITIZA faces competition from linaclotide which was recently approved for two of the three indications that AMITIZA has been approved in the U.S. and for IBS-C in certain European countries. Its manufacturer is seeking approval in other markets for IBS-C that we currently or intend to market AMITIZA. We also face competition from naloxegol which was recently approved for OIC in the U.S. and E.U. and will be marketed in the first quarter of 2015 in the US and is currently being launched in the E.U. Competitor products such as linaclotide and naloxegol may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than AMITIZA is by our partners or by us. Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors\u2019 branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than our products. As a result, if we fail to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nDevelopments by our competitors, the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we compete, or consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry could make our products or technologies less competitive or obsolete. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce products which are more effective than those developed by our competitors. Royalties or sales from our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced that represents a substantial improvement over our existing products.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop new products, and new indications for existing products, that achieve regulatory approval for commercialization.\nFor our business model to be successful, we must continually develop, manufacture and commercialize new products or achieve approval for new indications or label extensions for the use of our existing products. Prior to commercialization, these new products and product indications must satisfy stringent regulatory standards and receive requisite approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The development, regulatory review and approval, and commercialization processes are time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the development, approval or clearance, and commercialization of new products, including legal actions brought by our competitors. To obtain approval or clearance of new indications or products, we must submit, among other information, the results of preclinical and clinical studies on the new indication or product candidate to the applicable regulatory authorities. The number of preclinical and clinical studies that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the regulatory authority, the new indication or product candidate, the disease or condition for which the new indication or product candidate is in development and the regulations applicable to that new indication or product candidate. Even if we believe that the data collected from clinical trials of new indications for our existing products or for our product candidates are promising, applicable regulatory authorities may find such data to be insufficient to support approval of the new indication or product. The regulatory authority can delay, limit or deny approval or clearance of a new indication or product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nthe product is not safe or effective either generally or for a new indication;\n\u00b7\nour preclinical and clinical data is interpreted in different ways than we interpret that data;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to perform post-marketing clinical studies; or\n\u00b7\nthere may be changes in the approval policies or adoption of new regulations.\nProducts that we are currently developing, other future product candidates or new indications or label extensions for our existing products, may or may not receive the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary for marketing or may receive such approvals or clearances only after delays or unanticipated costs.\nWe continue to rely on third parties for the successful commercialization of some of our drug products. The success of these third parties will affect our ability to continue to develop new drug candidates.\nFor most of our operating history, we have been a research and development company. As we move to expand our management, organizational and operational capabilities, expand our global partnerships, develop our diversified product pipeline, acquire non-prostone clinical candidates, and enhance our capital structure, our operations will focus on organizing and staffing our company, building the necessary infrastructure to support these capabilities, developing the pipeline and non-prostone technologies which we may acquire, undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates, and pursuing the regulatory approval processes for additional indications for AMITIZA. Though we will continue to rely upon Takeda and Abbott to commercialize AMITIZA in most of the world, we may not be able to cause these third parties to effectively market and sell AMITIZA. While we are currently utilizing R-Tech to perform the exclusive manufacturing functions and rely on Takeda and Abbott to perform the sales and marketing functions with respect to the sale of AMITIZA, we may nevertheless encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays as Takeda obtains regulatory approvals and establishes the commercial markets for AMITIZA in the rest of the world. As we continue to develop and seek regulatory approval of additional product candidates and additional indications for lubiprostone, unoprostone isopropyl, cobiprostone, and ion channel activators within and outside the U.S., it could be difficult for us to access capital, to build the necessary infrastructure, to obtain and devote the resources necessary to obtain and develop product candidates, to effectively sell our products, and to provide resources to support commercialization of our products.\nWe are subject to on-going obligations to monitor the safety of our products and product candidates. Any failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products are marketed and our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials. With our collaborators, we are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. If regulatory agencies determine that we or our collaborators have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of lubiprostone or any other product candidate in clinical trials and the sale of AMITIZA or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product and product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for lubiprostone or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our business reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u00b7\nincreased warnings on product labels;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts as a result of related litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to successfully commercialize lubiprostone or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for both our clinical trials and our commercial exposures. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects or warnings found to be inadequate. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if the claim is successful and judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRecent federal legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, and other negative pricing trends could limit our ability to generate revenues.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was enacted in the U.S. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA. This legislation may have both immediate and long-term impacts on us. A number of the provisions of legislation require rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement, many of which have not yet occurred. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, regulatory approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nIn the U.S., the European Union, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nWe may generate growth through acquisitions and in-licensing and such strategy may not be successful if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition or licensing candidates, to negotiate appropriate terms of any such transaction or to successfully manage the integration of any acquisition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and in-licensing opportunities with third parties for our existing products and to complement our existing product pipeline. We have limited experience in completing acquisitions with third parties as well as performing under in-licensing agreements and we may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition or licensing candidates or to successfully negotiate the terms of any such transaction. The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical and biological products is a competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products in the pharmaceutical field, and they may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. If we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions or in-licensing transactions for suitable products and product candidates, our prospects for growth could suffer.\nEven if we are successful in completing one or more acquisitions, the failure to adequately address the financial, operational or legal risks of these transactions could harm our business. To finance an acquisition, we could be required to use our cash resources, issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur or assume debt or contingent liabilities. Accounting for acquisitions can require impairment losses or restructuring charges, large write-offs of in-process research and development expense and ongoing amortization expenses related to other intangible assets. In addition, integrating acquisitions can be difficult, and could disrupt our business and divert management resources. If we are unable to manage the integration of any acquisitions successfully, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand our product pipeline may be impaired.\nThe acquisition of Sucampo AG (SAG), in December 2010 resulted in the issuance of two subordinated unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $51.9 million to Ueno Trust and Kuno Trust. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the notes was $25.8 million. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may not be able to pay the obligations of the notes on a timely basis, which may adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to comply with the covenants and/or obligations related to the notes could result in an event of default, which could result in an immediate acceleration of the outstanding balance of the notes that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. As of December 31, 2014, we were compliant.\nRisks Related to Our Commercial Operations\nWe have a relatively short history of profitability. We may not maintain operating profitability in the future, and this could force us to delay, reduce or abandon our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe have recorded net income since 2012. However, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses for at least the next several years as we continue our research activities, conduct development of the prostone technology, seek and develop non-prostone products and compounds, seek regulatory approvals for additional indications and additional territories for AMITIZA and for other drug candidates, and protect the patents of our prostone products from generic challenges. Regulatory changes and changes in market conditions, including the generic competition, may require us to incur more expenses or change the timing of expenses such that we may incur unexpected losses. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to maintain profitability, the market value of our class A common stock may decline.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or abandon our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe expect our research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities. We may need substantial additional funding and be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or abandon our development programs.\nWe have continued to finance much of our operations by payments received under our collaboration agreements with Takeda and Abbott. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds that we anticipate from AMITIZA royalty revenues and product sales will be sufficient to enable us to fund our current operating expenses but not for all of our future research and development programs. Our future funding requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including:\nactual levels of product royalty and product sales from AMITIZA\n\u00b7\nthe cost of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u00b7\nthe scope and results of our research, preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in obtaining and maintaining proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to recruit and retain internal qualified human resources to conduct these activities;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our collaboration with Takeda and Abbott;\n\u00b7\nthe success of the commercialization efforts of AMITIZA; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations.\nIf we are required to raise additional funds from external sources, we might accomplish this through at-the-market sales, public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by at-the-market sales or issuing equity securities, current stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights and related intellectual property to our technologies, research programs, products or product candidates.\nWe are developing internationally and licensing our products globally; therefore, we have an increased exposure to foreign political conditions and regulatory requirements and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe expect that we will continue to seek global opportunities for our products and to develop candidates internationally in the future. Such opportunities and development will inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in international regulatory and compliance requirements that could restrict our ability to develop, market and sell our products;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u00b7\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\ndiffering labor regulations and business practices;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7\nchanges in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u00b7\nfinancial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA or similar foreign laws such as the UK Bribery Act.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. As we develop internationally, our exposure to these factors will increase.\nRisks Related to Product Pipeline\nIf our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, our ability to develop and commercialize our pipeline and non-prostone compounds will be impaired, which may jeopardize our business.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates from our pipeline and from non-prostone acquisitions, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, is subject to varying regulatory requirements and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7\nclinical research organizations we retain to conduct clinical trials may not perform according to the terms of the contract, causing delays or negative results in the clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and as a result we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we consider to be promising;\n\u00b7\ndesign of or enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we currently anticipate, resulting in significant delays, or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at rates that are higher than we had anticipated;\n\u00b7\nwe might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or perform additional trials, if we discover that the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate;\n\u00b7\nwe might have difficulty obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate being tested to complete our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nany regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable;\n\u00b7\nmany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, site selection, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do and smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of our product candidates may not be the desired or anticipated effects or may include undesirable side effects, or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics; and\n\u00b7\nif we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, not be able to obtain marketing approval, or obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as those for which we apply.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nWe may perform additional clinical trials for other indications or in support of applications for regulatory marketing approval in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for our products. These supplemental trials could be costly and could result in findings inconsistent with or contrary to our historic U.S. clinical trials.\nIn the future, we may be required, or we may elect, to conduct additional clinical trials of AMITIZA to improve the current label or address regulatory authorities concerns about AMITIZA. In addition, if we seek marketing approval from regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the U.S., they may require us to perform additional clinical trials that would be costly and difficult to know if there will be successful outcomes and to submit data from supplemental clinical trials in addition to data from the clinical trials that supported our U.S. filings with the FDA. Any requirements to conduct supplemental trials would add to the cost of developing our product candidates. Additional or supplemental trials could also produce findings that are inconsistent with the trial results we have previously submitted to the FDA, in which case we would be obligated to report those findings to the FDA. This could result in new restrictions on the existing marketing approval for AMITIZA or could force us to stop selling AMITIZA. Inconsistent trial results could also lead to delays in obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. for other indications for AMITIZA or for other product candidates and could cause regulators to impose restrictive conditions on marketing approvals and could even make it impossible for us to obtain marketing approval. Any of these results could materially impair our ability to generate revenues and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur agreements with makers of generic AMITIZA products are subject to government scrutiny in the U.S.\nWe are and have been involved in patent litigations that have resulted or may result in settlement agreements. We have filed our settlement and license agreements with Par and will file any future settlement agreements with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for review. The FTC has, in the past, brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements alleging violations of antitrust laws in connection therewith.\nWe may receive civil investigative demands from the FTC that requires us to provide the FTC information and documents relating to various settlement and other agreements with makers of generic AMITIZA products following patent infringement claims and litigation, and other efforts principally regarding AMITIZA. If the FTC believes that these or other agreements or efforts violates antitrust laws, it could challenge us through an administrative or judicial proceeding, which could result in the imposition of monetary and/or injunctive relief, including the invalidation of agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any such litigation could be protracted, requiring a substantial commitment of our management\u2019s time and cash expenditures over multiple years.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties, Including Related Parties\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities and are dependent upon R-Tech to manufacture and supply us with our product and product candidates. If R-Tech does not manufacture AMITIZA or our other product candidates in sufficient quantities, at acceptable quality levels and at acceptable cost and if we are unable to identify a suitable replacement manufacturer, our sales of AMITIZA and our further clinical development and commercialization of other products could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have little experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, exclusively on R-Tech to supply AMITIZA, unoprostone, cobiprostone and ion channel activators and any future prostone compounds that we may determine to develop or commercialize. We have granted R-Tech the exclusive right to manufacture and supply AMITIZA to meet our commercial and clinical requirements throughout the world. We do not have an alternative source of supply for AMITIZA, unoprostone, cobiprostone or ion channel activators. If R-Tech is not able to supply AMITIZA or these other compounds on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities and at acceptable levels of quality and price, and if we are unable to identify an alternate manufacturer to perform these functions on acceptable terms, sales of AMITIZA would be significantly impaired, and our development programs could be seriously jeopardized.\nThe risks of relying solely on R-Tech for the manufacture of our products include:\n\u00b7\nwe rely solely on R-Tech for quality assurance and their continued compliance with regulations relating to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals;\n\u00b7\nR-Tech\u2019s manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to produce commercial quantities of our product, or to keep up with subsequent increases in the quantities necessary to meet potentially growing demand;\n\u00b7\nR-Tech may not have access to the capital necessary to expand its manufacturing facilities in response to our needs;\n\u00b7\nGiven that the know-how and trade secrets of the manufacturing process for prostones are owned by R-Tech, if R-Tech were to cease conducting business, if its operations were to be interrupted, or we elect to contract with another manufacturer to supply us, it would be difficult and time consuming for us to find an alternate supplier and the change would need to be submitted to and approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nR-Tech relies on numerous sub-contractors to fulfill its manufacturing obligations, and any difficulty or disruption at one of these sub-contractors could jeopardize R-Tech\u2019s ability to produce AMITIZA or our other products;\n\u00b7\nR-Tech may experience events, such as a fire or natural disaster, that force it to stop or curtail production for an extended period; and\n\u00b7\nR-Tech could encounter significant increases in labor, capital or other costs that would make it difficult for R-Tech to produce our products cost-effectively.\nIn addition, R-Tech currently uses one supplier for the API used in the manufacture of prostones. R-Tech could experience delays in production should it become necessary to switch its source of supply for the API to another supplier or to manufacture the API itself. R-Tech has subcontracted with a single contract manufacturer to encapsulate the bulk form AMITIZA supplied by R-Tech into soft gelatin capsules and another manufacturer to package the final product for distribution in the U.S. If these subcontractors experience difficulties or delays in performing these services for any reason, our ability to deliver adequate supplies of finished product to physicians and patients will be impaired during the period in which R-Tech seeks an alternative manufacturer, which could cause us to lose revenues. In addition, any change in the party providing encapsulation of AMITIZA would need to be approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies, and any change in the party packaging the product would need to be submitted to and reviewed by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies, which could increase the time required to replace these subcontractors should that become necessary.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon R-Tech for the manufacture of our products and product candidates may adversely affect our future revenues, our cost structure, our ability to expand globally and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any approved products on a timely and competitive basis. In addition, if R-Tech should cease to manufacture prostones for our clinical trials for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these trials while we seek to identify and qualify replacement suppliers. We may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis, on terms that are favorable to us or at all.\nR-Tech and any other third-party manufacturer of our products and product candidates are subject to significant regulations governing manufacturing facilities and procedures.\nR-Tech, R-Tech\u2019s subcontractors and suppliers and any other potential manufacturer of our products or product candidates may fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations or other governmental regulations. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of systems to control and assure the quality of products approved for sale. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. may at any time audit or inspect a manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with cGMP or similar regulations. Our failure, or the failure of R-Tech, R-Tech\u2019s subcontractors and suppliers or any other third-party manufacturer we use, to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nIf it were to become necessary for us to replace R-Tech as contract manufacturer, we would compete with other companies for access to appropriate manufacturing facilities. Any such change would need to be submitted to and approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies before commercial activities of AMITIZA or any other product could resume. Among manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations, there are a limited number that would be both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so.\nWe depend significantly on our collaborations with Takeda and Abbott, and may depend in the future on collaborations with other third parties, to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nA key element of our business strategy is to collaborate where appropriate with third parties, particularly leading pharmaceutical companies, to co-develop, commercialize and market our products and product candidates. We are currently party to the North America Takeda Agreement for the co-development and commercialization of AMITIZA for gastrointestinal indications in the U.S. and Canada. In October 2014, we entered into the Takeda Amendment to amend the North America Takeda Agreement to, among other things, extend the term and providing that, during such extended term, Takeda and we will split the annual net sales revenue of the branded AMITIZA products. Also in October 2014, we and Takeda entered into the Global License Agreement for AMITIZA whereby Takeda will become the marketing authorization holder and will be responsible for all development, commercialization and regulatory activities other than in Canada, the U.S., Japan and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWe are also party to the Japan Abbott Agreement for the development and commercialization of AMITIZA in Japan. On February 27, 2015, Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and Mylan, Inc. (Mylan) closed Mylan\u2019s purchase of Abbott\u2019s non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which includes the Japan Abbott Agreement. Though we do not expect the commercialization of AMITIZA in Japan to be adversely affected, if Mylan does not devote the resources and effort to the commercialization of AMITIZA, our profitability could be affected. We have no commercial experience collaborating with Mylan, and consequently the compatibility of our two companies is unknown.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of Takeda, Abbott, and its successor under our agreement, Mylan. The risks that we face in connection with these collaborations and that we anticipate being subject to in any future collaborations, include the following:\n\u00b7\nour agreements with Takeda and Abbott are, and any future collaboration agreements that we may enter into are likely to be, subject to termination under various circumstances;\n\u00b7\nTakeda, Abbott and other future collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products that are the subject of their collaboration with us;\n\u00b7\nTakeda, Abbott and other future collaborators may underfund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing, marketing, distribution or other development of our products or may use committed resources inefficiently;\n\u00b7\nwe may become involved in disputes with our collaborators regarding operations, strategies, intellectual property or financial matters;\n\u00b7\nTakeda, Abbott and other future collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; and\n\u00b7\nTakeda, Abbott and other future collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts.\nThe ability of our products and product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if Takeda, Abbott or any other future collaborators decrease or fail to increase spending relating to such products, fail to dedicate sufficient resources to developing or promoting our products or change their business focus.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily or may fail to meet established deadlines for the completion of these trials.\nWe generally do not have the independent ability to conduct global clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs), clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to perform this function. For example, approximately 130 separate clinical investigators participated in our trials for IBS-C. We use multiple CROs to coordinate the efforts of our clinical investigators and to accumulate the results of our trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.\nIn addition, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as cGCP, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.\nConflicts of interest may arise between R-Tech and us, and these conflicts might ultimately be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us.\nOur founders, Dr. Sachiko Kuno and Dr. Ryuji Ueno, together own a majority of the stock of R-Tech. Drs. Kuno and Ueno are married to each other. Ownership interests of our founders in the stock of R-Tech may give rise to conflicts of interest when faced with a decision that could favor the interests of one of the affiliated companies over another. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to existing or possible future commercial arrangements between us and R-Tech in which the terms and conditions of the arrangements are subject to negotiation or dispute. For example, conflicts of interest could arise over matters such as:\n\u00b7\ndisputes over the cost or quality of the manufacturing services provided to us by R-Tech with respect to AMITIZA, unoprostone, cobiprostone and ion channel activators;\n\u00b7\na decision whether to engage R-Tech in the future to manufacture and supply compounds other than AMITIZA, unoprostone, cobiprostone and ion channel activators;\n\u00b7\na decision whether to renegotiate the terms of our existing agreements with R-Tech or a strategic acquisition with R-Tech; or\n\u00b7\nbusiness opportunities unrelated to prostones that may be attractive both to us and to the other company.\nIf tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies or other tax positions, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe are a member of an affiliated group of entities, including R-Tech, which is directly or indirectly controlled by Drs. Ueno and Kuno. We have had and will continue to have significant commercial transactions with these entities. Furthermore, we operate three foreign subsidiaries, Sucampo Pharma, LLC, based in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan; Sucampo Pharma Europe, Ltd., based in Oxford, U.K.; and SAG, based in Zug, Switzerland. We expect to operate through a consolidated organizational structure and we expect to enter into commercial transactions with some of these entities or future subsidiaries on an ongoing basis. As a result of these transactions, we will be subject to complex transfer pricing and other tax regulations in both the U.S. and the other countries in which we and our affiliates operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between our subsidiaries and affiliates and us be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm\u2019s length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the related party agreements. To the extent that U.S. or any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing or other policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties related to prior, existing and future related party agreements. As of December 31, 2013, we performed updated tax analyses wherein liabilities for uncertain tax positions were recorded for certain state jurisdictions based on nexus related to the sourcing of revenues. Should the tax authorities in one or more of these states have different interpretations than us, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe have received notifications from generic companies that they have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) with the FDA against our products. In response, we initiated patent infringement lawsuits against those generic companies which are ongoing as to certain of these companies and settled as to others. If we are unable to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected and our ability to derive revenue from our products would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technology and know-how upon which our products are based, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our intellectual property will depend on our success, in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. The scope of protection afforded by a set of patent claims is subject to inherent uncertainty unless the patent has already been litigated and a court has ruled on the meaning of the claim language and other issues affecting how broadly a patent claim can be enforced. In some cases, we license patent applications from R-Tech instead of issued patents, and we do not know whether these patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents.\nOur licensed patents have recently been challenged in the U.S. for AMITIZA (lubiprostone) by Par and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. (Dr. Reddy\u2019s) and for RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl) by Par Pharmaceutical through the filing of ANDAs by those generic companies with the FDA. Other licensed patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit the term of patent protection for lubiprostone, unoprostone isopropyl or our other products, diminish our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In response to the filed ANDAs, we filed patent infringement lawsuits regarding AMITIZA against Par and Dr. Reddy\u2019s. In October 2014, we resolved our patent litigation with Par in the U.S. related to our AMITIZA (lubiprostone) 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule products in which we and R-Tech granted Par a non-exclusive license to market Par\u2019s generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg soft gelatin capsule and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIA beginning January 1, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances. Beginning on January 1, 2021, Par will split with us the gross profits of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement, which continues until each of our related patents has expired. In the event Par elects to launch an authorized generic form of lubiprostone, we agree to supply Par under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.\nIn November 2014, we, R-Tech Ueno, Ltd., Takeda, and certain affiliates of Takeda filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Dr. Reddy's. The lawsuit claims infringement of the same 7 patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book involved in the Par lawsuit, with the latest expiring in 2027. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of the patent infringement lawsuit, final FDA approval of Dr. Reddy's ANDA will be stayed up to 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice letter.\nIn February 2015, we and R-Tech executed a stipulation and license agreement (Stipulation Agreement) with Par Pharmaceutical for RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl) ophthalmic solution 0.15% indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation Agreement, we and R-Tech are obligated to grant Par Pharmaceutical, prior to the expiration of the latest expiring patent relating to RESCULA, a non-exclusive license to market Par Pharmaceutical\u2019s generic version or authorized generic of unoprostone isopropyl ophthalmic solution 0.15% indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension product in the U.S. Under such license, Par Pharmaceutical will split with us the gross profits of the generic or authorized generic version sold during the term of the Stipulation Agreement, which continues until the last of our patents relating to RESCULA have expired. In the event Par Pharmaceutical elects to so launch an authorized generic form of unoprostone isopropyl, we will supply Par Pharmaceutical under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.\nWe have certain patents on our products that expire in the near future. We may not be able to use other existing patents or patent applications to successfully protect our products from generic competition. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of R-Tech\u2019s patents and our intellectual property or narrow the scope of the protection provided by these patents. Accordingly, we cannot determine the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights in the patents and patent applications. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, a related patent may expire or may remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nPatents may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor R-Tech can be certain whether a judicial court will uphold the validity of a patent.\nIf our patent position does not adequately protect our product and product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business, possibly materially.\nThe patent rights relating to lubiprostone consist of 25 issued U.S. patents, 10 issued European patents, and 16 issued Japanese patents relating to compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacturing. These patent rights also include various U.S., European and Japanese patent applications relating to dosing regimens, pharmaceutical formulations and other claims. The U.S. patents relating to compositions of matter expire between 2020 and 2027. The other U.S. and foreign patents expire between 2020 and 2029.\nOur commercial success with respect to lubiprostone will depend significantly on our ability to protect our existing patent position with respect to lubiprostone as well as our ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates and any future products in the U.S. and other countries.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of our pending patent applications or those we have licensed will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of our patents or those we have licensed will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for any additional commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; or\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product and any product candidates.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products or product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may obtain patents in the future and allege that our products or product candidates or the use of our technologies infringes these patent claims or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Likewise, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our existing or future patents.\nProceedings involving our patents or patent applications or those of others could result in adverse decisions regarding:\n\u00b7\nthe patentability of our inventions relating to our product or any product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nthe enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our product or any product candidates.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIn addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:\n\u00b7\nincur substantial monetary damages;\n\u00b7\nencounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market; and\n\u00b7\nbe precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates.\nIn such event, our business could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Oversight\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or appropriate pricing for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidates.\nAs we increase our foreign license arrangements, we or our partner are seeking and will continue to seek approval in different territories. Different regulatory agencies may reach different decisions in assessing the approval and pricing of our product candidates. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the regulatory agencies for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited in scope or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable. If any regulatory approval that we obtain is delayed or is limited, we may decide not to commercialize the product candidate after receiving the approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is competitive with one or more of our product candidates and we cannot show that our product candidate is clinically superior, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., may designate drugs that target relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have received an orphan drug designation from the FDA for cobiprostone for the treatment of disorders associated with cystic fibrosis, and for unoprostone Isopropyl from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. We have sought orphan drug designation from EMA for cobiprostone for the treatment of oral mucositis and we may seek such status with additional product candidates. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity. The exclusivity applies only to the indication for which the drug has been designated and approved. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the U.S., but this period may be interrupted if a sponsor of a competitive product that is otherwise the same drug for the same use can show that its drug is clinically superior to our orphan drug candidate. The European exclusivity period is ten years, but may be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for cobiprostone or unoprostone isopropyl for these indications, we may not be able to maintain it if a competitor with a product that is otherwise the same drug can establish that its product is clinically superior.\nWe must comply with federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, and other rules relating to the health care business, and, if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe are or will be directly or indirectly through our collaborators, subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, the states and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid Programs;\n\u00b7\nother Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Statements Act, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; and\n\u00b7\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules or policies described above or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our collaborators are or will be subject, or if the interpretation of the foregoing changes, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, we do not control our collaborators, including their compliance activities and if our collaborators are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions may be open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert management resources from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nWe only have regulatory approval for commercial distribution and reimbursement of lubiprostone in a limited number of countries, and may not receive regulatory approval in other countries.\nWe are currently permitted to market lubiprostone in only a limited number of countries on a commercial basis. To obtain marketing approval in other countries, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, pricing, promotion and distribution of the product. Approval procedures vary among countries, and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. For example, we and Takeda are currently exploring the commercialization of AMITIZA in Canada. We may not be successful in obtaining such approval.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities in countries outside the U.S. and E.U. are increasingly requiring risk management plans and post-marketing commitments which may be more onerous than those required in the U.S. and E.U. The time required to obtain approval in other countries may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or marketing authorization from the E.U. In particular, in many countries outside the U.S., including most E.U. countries and Canada, a product must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before it can be commercialized broadly. This can result in substantial delays in such countries, and the price that is ultimately approved may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer, or would be willing to offer, lubiprostone in such countries, and may impact pricing in other countries. Marketing and pricing and reimbursement approval in one country does not ensure such approvals in another. Failure to obtain the approvals necessary to commercialize lubiprostone in other countries at reimbursement levels that are acceptable to us or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals would impair our partners\u2019 ability to develop foreign markets for lubiprostone.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur majority stockholders and their affiliates maintain the ability to have significant control over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could result in actions of which you or other stockholders do not approve.\nAs of March 2, 2015, our founders, Dr. Ryuji Ueno and Dr. Sachiko Kuno, together through their direct or indirect interest in S&R Technology Holding, LLC, held 25,675,255 shares of class A common stock, representing approximately 57.2% of our outstanding class A common stock. Therefore, until such time that the selling stockholders further dispose of additional shares of class A common stock, this concentration of ownership and voting power could influence all matters requiring stockholder approval and have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price if a change in control is proposed.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our stockholders. For example, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our class A common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u00b7\nonly one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 75.0% vote and for cause;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nstockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our class A common stock. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management.\nOur class A common stock is thinly traded and our stock price is volatile; investors in our class A common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe public trading market for our class A common stock is characterized by small trading volumes and a highly volatile stock price. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry factors might seriously harm the market price of our class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their class A common stock at or above the price they paid, and may have difficulty selling their shares at any price. The market price for our class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure of AMITIZA (lubiprostone) or other approved products, if any, to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory status of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third party suppliers and manufacturers to perform;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results;\n\u00b7\nvariations in the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems and other regulatory developments;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nWe will not be able to control many of these factors, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our capital stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our capital stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our capital stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nSubstantial future sales of our class A common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and make it difficult for you to recover the full value of your investment in our class A common stock.\nAs of March 2, 2015, we had 44,900,719 shares of class A common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are available for public sale, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus. The market price of our class A common stock may decline if our class A common stockholders sell a large number of shares of our class A common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur. In addition, as of March 2, 2015, we had 4,005,494 outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 4,005,494 shares of our class A common stock. If these options are exercised and the shares issued upon exercise are sold, the market price of our securities may also decline. These factors also could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our securities.", "PERMNO": 92226, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SCMP"}
