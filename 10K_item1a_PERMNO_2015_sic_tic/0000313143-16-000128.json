RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements at the end of Item 1 and Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nWe recently completed a global strategic review of our business. If our new strategic direction does not yield the expected results or we fail to implement the necessary changes to our operations, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe recently undertook a global strategic review of our business portfolio to identify which end markets and product franchises have the strongest growth opportunities. As a result of that review, we organized our current products into four franchises for purposes of evaluating their growth potential: Plasma, Hemostasis Management, Donor and Cell Processing. We concluded that Plasma and Hemostasis Management have the greatest growth potential, while Cell Processing innovation offers an opportunity to increase market share and expand into new segments. We believe Donor is competing in challenging markets which require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs and the scope of the current product line.\nIf we have not correctly identified the franchises with greatest growth potential, we will not allocate our resources appropriately which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if we are unable to reduce costs and complexity in our Donor franchise, we will obtain lower than expected cash flows to fund our future growth and capital needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our product lines through internal research & development and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nContinued growth of our business depends on our maintaining a pipeline of profitable new products and successful improvements to our existing products. This requires accurate market analysis and carefully targeted application of intellectual and financial resources toward technological innovation or acquisition of new products. The creation and adoption of technological advances is only one step. We must also efficiently develop the technology into a product which confers a competitive advantage, represents a cost effective solution or provides improved patient care. Finally, as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe risks of missteps and set backs are an inherent part of the innovation and development processes in the medical device industry.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow our business through business relationships and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nPromising partnerships and acquisitions may not be completed for reasons such as competition among prospective partners or buyers, our inability to reach satisfactory terms, or the need for regulatory approvals. Any acquisition that we complete may be dilutive to earnings and require the investment of significant resources. The economic environment may constrain our ability to access the capital needed for acquisitions and other capital investments.\nA significant portion of our revenue derives from the sale of blood collection supplies. Declines in the number of blood collection procedures have adversely impacted our business and future declines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales to blood collectors represented 39.7% of our consolidated disposables revenues in fiscal 2016. In certain markets, changes in medical protocols and the development of less invasive, lower blood loss procedures has reduced the number of transfusions of red blood cells, which has in turn led to a decline in the number of blood collection procedures. This is particularly true in the United States where we saw collections decline by approximately 10% and 7% in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively. We expect this trend to continue further in fiscal 2017.\nIn response to this trend, certain large U.S. blood center collection groups pursued single source vendors for whole blood collection products which required significant reductions in average selling prices in order to retain or increase our share of their business. During fiscal 2014, we entered into a multi-year agreement to supply the HemeXcel Purchasing Alliance, LLC with certain whole blood collection components during the calendar years 2014-2016. The agreement included a reduction in average selling prices which was implemented at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2015. In March 2014, the American Red Cross selected another exclusive supplier to provide certain whole blood products. This reduced annualized revenues by approximately $25.0 million beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2016, the American Red Cross and two group purchasing organizations representing other U.S. blood collectors (\"Blood Center GPOs\") pursued arrangements for apheresis red cell collections. These negotiations have concluded and will negatively affect red cell revenues and gross margins, a negative impact of approximately $12 million is expected on fiscal 2017 operating income.\nConsolidation of the healthcare providers and blood collectors has increased demand for price concessions and caused the exclusion of suppliers from significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and policy influences are causing the healthcare and blood collection industries to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs and causing healthcare delivery structure reforms, including the reduction in blood use reduced payments for care. These trends have placed greater pricing pressure on suppliers, decreased average selling prices and increased the number of sole source relationships. This pressure impacts our Hospital and Blood Center businesses.\nThe expansion among hospitals in the United States of group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts directly puts price pressure on our Hospital business. It also puts price pressure on our United States Blood Center customers who are also facing reduced demand for red cells. Our Blood Center customers have responded to this pressure by creating their own group purchasing organizations and resorting to single source tenders to create incentives for suppliers, including us, to significantly reduce prices.\nWe expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors. This may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our products and services. If we fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nAs approximately half of our revenue comes from outside the United States, we are subject to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe do business in over 100 countries and have distributors in approximately 90 countries. This exposes us to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf there are sanctions or restrictions on the flow of capital which prevent product importation or receipt of payments in Russia or China, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar anti-corruption laws in other countries. Generally, these laws prohibit companies and their business partners or other intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governments and government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Global enforcement of such anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings. While we have an active compliance program and various other safeguards to discourage impermissible practices, we have distributors in 90 countries, several of which are considered high risk for corruption. As a result, our global operations carry some risk of unauthorized impermissible activity on the part of one of our distributors, employees, agents or consultants. Any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on our ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nExport of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the United States to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control.\nFinally, any other significant changes in the competitive, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international business could have a material impact on our business.\nOur future success depends on the continued services of skilled personnel.\nWe constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess our key personnel that we believe are essential to our long-term success. Over the last year, we have transitioned to a new Chief Executive Officer, are in the process of hiring a new Chief Financial Officer and have hired new personnel in a number of key executive positions. We have also effected significant organizational and strategic changes in connection therewith. If we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes, including the timely identification of a new Chief Financial Officer, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations or experience a disruption in our cash flows, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, ability to complete our share repurchase program or cost of borrowing.\nWe have $408.1 million of debt outstanding at April 2, 2016. The obligations to pay interest and repay the borrowed amounts may restrict our ability to adjust to adverse economic conditions, our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition or other general corporate requirements. The interest rate on the loan is variable and subject to change based on market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a global corporation we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. These balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt.\nOur credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and make interest and principal payments. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms, or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowed amounts on short notice.\nAdditional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As of April 2, 2016, we had $408.1 million of debt obligations due prior to July 1, 2019. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on debt obligations.\nWe recorded goodwill and other asset impairment charges during the current fiscal year and may record additional charges in future periods.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we concluded that indicators of potential goodwill impairment were present for the EMEA and Americas Blood Center and Hospital reporting units, therefore requiring an interim test for goodwill impairment. We recorded a preliminary impairment charge of $66.3 million in the EMEA reporting unit during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed our goodwill impairment test and concluded that no adjustment to the $66.3 million impairment loss initially recorded was required. The impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 represented the entire goodwill balance allocated to EMEA. This charge does not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations, future operations, or compliance with debt covenants. Although the analysis indicated only the EMEA reporting unit was impaired, we will continue to monitor the Americas Blood Center and Hospital, which has an excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 25.8% and has allocated goodwill of $175.9 million, as this operating unit is most at risk in future periods if our estimated future cash flows differ from our actual operating results.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded an impairment charge of $18.7 million to write down the carrying value of the SOLX intangible assets after we updated our assessment of the market potential for the SOLX technology and concluded that it was no longer commercially reasonable to bring this technology to market.\nFinally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed our global strategic review which resulted in the identification of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that were at risk of being impaired due\nto changes in the strategic direction of the Company. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed impairment tests for each of the identified assets and based on revised expectations, we recorded asset impairment charges of $16.2 million.\nGoodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges could materially adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. We will continue to monitor our intangible assets for potential impairments in future periods. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.\nAs a medical device manufacturer we are subject to a number of laws and regulations. Non-compliance with those laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other non-United States regulatory bodies. We must obtain specific regulatory clearance prior to selling any new product or service, a process which is costly and time consuming. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance we will be unable to introduce new enhanced product. Our operations are also subject to continuous review and monitoring by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Failure to substantially comply with applicable regulations could subject our products to recall or seizure by government authorities, or an order to suspend manufacturing activities. If our products were determined to have design or manufacturing flaws, this could result in their recall or seizure. Either of these situations could also result in the imposition of fines.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial means and resources, which may allow them to more rapidly develop new technologies and more quickly address changes in customer requirements.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends on a combination of factors. Certain factors are within our control such as reputation, regulatory approvals, patents, unpatented proprietary know-how in several technological areas, product quality, safety, cost effectiveness and continued rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control such as regulatory standards, medical standards, reimbursement policies and practices, and the practice of medicine.\nLoss of a significant customer could adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2016, although no one customer represented more than 10% of our revenues, our ten largest customers accounted for 36.0% of our revenue. If any of our largest customers materially reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us for any reason, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not continue to realize the benefits from our Value Creation and Capture initiatives.\nIn fiscal 2016, we completed our multi-year Value Creation and Capture initiatives. These initiatives have reduced manufacturing costs and improved supply chain efficiency. However, there are no assurances the cost savings or supply chain efficiencies will continue as our business evolves. In addition, the activities involved the relocation of several product lines to new manufacturing facilities. As these transitions are completed, we may yet experience challenges with the new manufacturing locations, additional costs, or unacceptable quality. These may lead to additional working capital, warranty or inventory costs.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business.\nCertain key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain finished goods, components and raw materials from sole suppliers, notably JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCurrent or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries\u2019 national economies. Worsening economic conditions may lead to the rationing of care or reduced order patterns. Although, we have not incurred significant losses on government receivables to date, we continually evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of customers or the countries\u2019 healthcare systems deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, allowances may be required in future periods.\nAs a global corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational revenues and expenses account for a substantial portion of our operations and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In fiscal 2016, our international revenues accounted for 42.9% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes different forms. Reported revenues, as well as manufacturing and operational costs denominated in foreign currencies by our international businesses, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services sold by us into international markets, where payment for our products and services and related manufacturing and operational costs is made in local currencies.\nWe are entrusted with sensitive personal information relating to surgical patients, blood donors, employees and other persons in the course of operating our business and serving our customers.\nGovernment agencies require that we implement measures to ensure the integrity and security of such personal data and, in the event of a breach of protocol, we inform affected individuals. If our systems are not properly designed or implemented, or should suffer a breach of security or an intrusion (e.g., \u201chacking\u201d) by unauthorized persons, the Company\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and it could incur costs and liabilities to affected persons and enforcement agencies.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and to serve our customers and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with communicable diseases. A significant outbreak of a disease could reduce the demand for our products and affect our ability to provide our customers with products and services.\nAn eligible donor\u2019s willingness to donate is affected by concerns about their personal health and safety. Concerns about communicable diseases (such as pandemic flu, SARS, or HIV) could reduce the number of donors, and accordingly reduce the demand for our products for a period of time. A significant outbreak of a disease could also affect our employees\u2019 ability to work, which could limit our ability to produce product and service our customers.\nThere is a risk that the Company\u2019s intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation in some countries.\nCertain countries, particularly China, do not enforce compliance with laws that protect intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights with the same degree of vigor as is available under the U.S. and European systems of justice. Further, certain of the Company\u2019s IP rights are not registered in China, or if they were, have since expired. This may permit others to produce copies of products in China that are not covered by currently valid patent registrations. There is also a risk that such products may be exported from China to other countries.\nIn order to aggressively protect our IP throughout the world, we have a program of patent disclosures and filings in markets where we conduct significant business. While we believe this program is reasonable and adequate, the risk of loss is inherent in litigation as different legal systems offer different levels of protection to IP, and it is still possible that even patented technologies may not be protected absolutely from infringement.\nPending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. This type of litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Patent litigation may result in adverse outcomes and could significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nThe technologies that support our products are the subject of active patent prosecution.\nThere is a risk that one or more of our products may be determined to infringe a patent held by another party. If this were to occur we may be subject to an injunction or to payment of royalties, or both, which may adversely affect our ability to market the affected product(s). In addition, competitors may patent technological advances which may give them a competitive advantage or create barriers to entry.\nWe sell our products in certain emerging economies.\nThere are risks with doing business in emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. These economies tend to have less mature product regulatory systems, and more volatile financial markets. In addition, the government controlled health care system's ability to invest in our products and systems may abruptly shift due to changing government priorities or funding capacity. Our ability to sell products in these economies is dependent upon our ability to hire qualified employees or agents to represent our products locally, and our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a less mature regulatory environment. If we are unable to retain qualified representatives or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to sell products in these markets. We are exposed to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies.\nIn many of the international markets in which we do business, including certain parts of Europe, South America, the Middle East, Russia and Asia, our employees, agents or distributors offer to sell our products in response to public tenders issued by various governmental agencies.\nThere is additional risk in selling our products through agents or distributors, particularly in public tenders. If they misrepresent our products, do not provide appropriate service and delivery, or commit a violation of local or U.S. law, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subject to fines, sanctions or both.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which includes key sole source suppliers.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which involves integrating key suppliers and our manufacturing capacity into a global movement of components and finished goods.\nWe have certain key suppliers, including JMS Co. Ltd. (\"JMS\"), Kawasumi Laboratories (\"Kawasumi\") and Sanmina Corporation, who have their own complex supply chains. JMS and Kawasumi make certain finished goods and important sub components in locations throughout Asia. We have engaged Sanmina Corporation to be the sole manufacturer of certain equipment as part of our manufacturing network optimization activities.\nAny disruption to one or more of our suppliers\u2019 production or delivery of sufficient volumes of subcomponents conforming to our specifications could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver finished products to our customers. For example, we purchase components in Asia for use in manufacturing in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Scotland. We also regularly ship finished goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Scotland to Europe and Asia.\nPlastics are the principal component of our disposables, which are the main source of our revenues. Any change in the price, composition or availability of the plastics we purchase could adversely affect our business.\nWe have three risks with this key raw material: price, composition and availability.\nIncreases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials. Increases in the costs of other commodities may affect our procurement costs to a lesser degree.\nThe composition of the plastic we purchase is also important. Today, we purchase plastics which contain phthalates, which are used to make plastic malleable. Should plastics with phthalates become unavailable due to regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain new FDA or foreign approvals for a number of products.\nWhile we have not experienced shortages in the past, any interruption in the supply for certain plastics could have a material impact on our business by limiting our ability to manufacture and sell the products which represent a significant portion of our revenues.\nOur products are made with materials which are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.\nEnvironmental regulations may prohibit the use of certain compounds in products we market and sell in regulated markets. If we are unable to substitute suitable materials into our processes, our manufacturing operations may be disrupted. In addition, we may be obligated to disclose the origin of certain materials used in our products, including but not limited to, metals mined from locations which have been the site of human rights violations.\nWe operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims.\nOur products are relied upon by medical personnel in connection with the treatment of patients and the collection of blood from donors. In the event that patients or donors sustain injury or death in connection with their condition or treatment, we, along with others, may be sued, and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time.\nIn addition, such litigation could damage our reputation and, therefore, impair our ability to market our products, obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. While we believe that our current product liability insurance coverage is sufficient, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes, which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis.\nIn connection with our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes. For a discussion of our internal controls over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see \"Controls and Procedures\" in Part II, Item 9A of this Report.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management's assessment identified control deficiencies associated with the transition from utilizing tax consultants to establishing expanded in-house tax capabilities and resources, as well as issues in the design and implementation of controls to review and analyze the Company's income tax provisions, income taxes payable and receivable, and deferred income tax balances that led management to conclude that control deficiencies existed at April 2, 2016. While reported tax provisions and related accounts are believed to be accurate, as a result of these deficiencies, until they are substantially remediated, it is possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors in the tax accounting reflected in our financial statements from occurring that could be material, either individually or in the aggregate.\nWhile actions have been taken to improve our internal controls in response to the identified material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for income taxes, additional work continues to address and remediate the identified material weakness. Until these actions are fully implemented and tested, a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to income taxes will continue to exist. As a result, our ability to accurately report, on a timely basis, our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76837, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "HAE"}
