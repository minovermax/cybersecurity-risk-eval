{"cik": "1253317", "company": "OLD LINE BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with other information contained in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Any of the following events, should they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRisk Factors Related to the Pending Merger with DCB Bancshares, Inc.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger. The success of the pending merger with DCB, as discussed above under \u201cItem 1 - Business,\u201d will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business with DCB\u2019s. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, however, we must successfully combine the businesses of Old Line Bancshares and DCB. If we are unable to do so, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOld Line Bancshares and DCB have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of key depositors or other bank customers and the disruption of DCB\u2019s ongoing business, as well as or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect DCB\u2019s ability to maintain its relationships with its clients, customers, depositors and employees, which could have a negative impact on our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may, to some extent, also divert management\u2019s attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Old Line Bancshares and DCB during such transition period.\nThe market price of Old Line Bancshares common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares currently. The businesses of Old Line Bancshares and DCB differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of our common stock.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Old Line Bancshares and DCB. These uncertainties may impair Old Line Bancshares\u2019 and DCB\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, depositors and borrowers pending the consummation of the merger, as such personnel, depositors and borrowers may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers, vendors and others who deal with Old Line Bancshares or DCB to seek to change existing business relationships with Old Line Bancshares or DCB or fail to extend an existing relationship. In addition, competitors may target each party\u2019s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger.\nFurther, the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration in connection therewith may place a burden on each of Old Line Bancshares\u2019 and DCB\u2019s management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations both before and after consummation of the merger.\nIf the merger is not completed, Old Line Bancshares will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits. Old Line Bancshares has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the merger. The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction of specified conditions, including regulatory approvals and the requisite approval of DCB\u2019s stockholders. There is no guarantee that these conditions will be met. If the merger is not completed, these expenses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition because we would not have realized the expected benefits for which these expenses were incurred.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or impose conditions that are not presently anticipated. Before the merger may be completed, we must obtain various regulatory approvals. These regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, and may contain conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger that are not anticipated or that have a material adverse effect. Although we do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting our revenues following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on us following the merger. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results. If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nWe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay DCB a termination fee of approximately $1.3 million under the merger agreement;\n\u00b7\nWe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; and\n\u00b7\nMatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Old Line Bancshares as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.\nIf the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nRisk Factors Related to Old Line Bancshares\u2019 Business\nSystem failure or cybersecurity breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other potential losses. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. The computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure we use, including\nour Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by Internet problems, other users or unrelated third parties. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers, and inhibit current and potential customers from using our Internet banking services, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically review our security protocols and, as necessary, add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing. These precautions may not, however, be effective in preventing such breaches, damage or failures. We continue to monitor developments in this area and consider whether additional protective measures are necessary or appropriate, and we have obtained insurance protection intended to cover losses due to network security breaches; there is no guarantee, however, that such insurance, would cover all costs associated with any breach, damage or failure of our computer systems and network infrastructure.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger with DCB Bancshares. In February 2017, we announced execution of merger agreement with DCB Bancshares, Inc. (DCB) the parent company of Damascus Community Bank. The ultimate success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our business with DCB. It is possible that the continuing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of key depositors or other bank customers, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standard controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain our relationships with our clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nWe rely on certain external vendors. Our business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. Our operations are exposed to the risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in our agreements for any number of reasons including equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of our operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in prevailing economic conditions, including declining real estate values, changes in interest rates that may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events may adversely affect our financial results. We continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. Economic growth continues to be slow and uneven. A return to recessionary conditions or prolonged stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the demand for our products and services, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. In any case, we expect that the business environment in the State of Maryland and the entire United States will continue to present challenges for the foreseeable future. Further continuing economic uncertainty, including regarding concerns about U.S. debt levels and related governmental actions, including potential tariffs on imports into the United States and cuts in government spending, may negatively impact economic conditions going forward. In addition, an increase in unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming and criticized classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the adverse economic climate during the past several years has not severely impacted us due to our strict underwriting standards, any adverse changes in the economy going forward, including decreases in current real estate values, increased unemployment or the economy moving back into a recession, could have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve Board, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has among other things kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\nIf the Federal Reserve Board continues to increase the federal funds rate in the near term, as is expected, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic growth. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a negative impact on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing our loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nA worsening of credit markets and economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity. Old Line Bank must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure cash flow is available to satisfy current and future financial obligations including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding of operating costs and other corporate purposes. We obtain funding through deposits and various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased, unsecured borrowings, brokered certificates of deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and others. Economic uncertainty and disruptions in the financial system may adversely affect our liquidity. Dramatic declines in the housing market and falling real estate prices coupled with increased foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant asset value write downs by financial institutions during and after the last U.S. recession, including government sponsored entities and investment banks. These investment write downs caused financial institutions to seek additional capital. Should we experience a substantial deterioration in our financial condition or should disruptions in the financial markets restrict our funding, it would negatively impact our liquidity. To mitigate this risk, we closely monitor our liquidity and maintain a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank and have received approval to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nOur concentrations of loans in various categories may also increase the risk of credit losses. We currently invest more than 25% of our capital in various loan types and industry segments, including commercial real estate loans and loans to the hospitality industry (hotels/motels). While declines in the local commercial real estate market following the last recession have not caused the collateral securing our loans to exceed acceptable loan to value ratios, a deterioration in the commercial real estate market could cause deterioration in the collateral securing these loans and/or a decline in our customers\u2019 earning capacity. This could negatively impact us. Although we have made a large portion of our hospitality loans to long-term, well-established operators in strategic locations, a decline in the occupancy rate in these facilities could negatively impact their earnings. This could adversely impact their ability to repay their loan, which would adversely impact our net income.\nOur need to comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation could have an adverse effect on our business and our growth strategy, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to attract and retain personnel and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our rate of growth and changes in regulations could adversely affect us. The cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, if we are not in compliance with such requirements, we could be subject to fines or other regulatory action that could restrict our ability to operate or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we believe we are material compliance with all applicable regulations, it is possible there are violations of which we are unaware that could be discovered by our regulators in the course of an examination or otherwise, which could trigger such fines or other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal or state regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations. In light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial sector, there may be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions\u2019 regulatory agencies in the future. Changes in regulation and oversight, including in the form of changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the service and products we offer, increase our operating expenses, increase compliance challenges and otherwise adversely impact our financial performance and condition. In addition, the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and Old Line Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors.\nNon-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government has previously imposed laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations\nRequirements to hold more capital could have a material adverse impact on us. The impact of the revised capital rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us and increased the minimum levels of capital we are required to hold, as discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy Guidelines.\u201d The rules apply to Old Line Bancshares as well as to the Bank. These rules include a capital conservation buffer that phases in over a period of years that began in 2016 and will become fully effective in 2019. Failure to satisfy the additional capital requirements of the capital conservation buffer will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. The rules establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that may be utilized for such actions if the capital requirements of the buffer are not fully satisfied. Beginning January 1, 2017, our capital requirements with the applicable capital conservation buffer are (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 5.75%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) ratio of 7.25% and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 9.25%. The capital conservation buffer does not apply to our leverage ratio requirement, which will remain at 4.0%. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the resulting requirements will be a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. These increased capital requirements may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations, or the failure to satisfy such requirements may result in our inability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock, which could also negatively impact the market price for our stock, and may negatively impact our ability to retain personnel if our ability to pay retention bonuses is compromised.\nOur internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any (a) failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, (b) failure to adequately address any internal control deficiencies, or (c) failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes. As a financial institution, we are subject to risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We believe we have controls in place to detect and prevent such losses, but in some cases multi-party collusion or other sophisticated methods of hiding fraud may not be readily detected or detectable, and could result in losses that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial crime is not limited to the financial services industry. Our customers could experience fraud in their businesses, which could materially impact their ability to repay their loans, and deposit customers in all financial institutions are constantly and unwittingly solicited by others in fraud schemes that vary from easily detectable and obvious attempts to high-level and very complex international schemes that could drain an account of millions of dollars and require detailed financial forensics to unravel. While we have controls in place, contractual agreements with our customers partitioning liability, and insurance to help mitigate the risk, none of these are guarantees that we will not experience a\nloss, potentially a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. The FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under this guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm non-residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. We have concluded that we have a concentration in commercial real estate lending under the foregoing standards because our balance in commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2016 represents more than 300% of total capital. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties and our financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information. In deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which we do not independently verify as a matter of course. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Bank. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFPB and other federal agencies to issue many new and significant rules and regulations to implement its various provisions. There are a number of regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that have not yet been fully adopted and implemented and we will not know the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business until such regulations are fully implemented. As a result, we cannot predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and a diversion of management\u2019s\ntime from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nBecause we serve a limited market area in Maryland, an economic downturn in our market area could more adversely affect us than it affects our larger competitors that are more geographically diverse. Our current market area consists of the suburban Maryland counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s and St. Mary\u2019s. If the pending merger with DCB is consummated this market area will expand into Frederick County, Maryland, and we may expand in contiguous northern and western Counties, such as Howard County, Maryland. Broad geographic diversification, however, is not currently part of our community bank focus. Overall, during and following the most recent recession, the business environment has negatively impacted many businesses and households in the United States and worldwide. Although the economic decline has not impacted the suburban Maryland and Washington D.C. suburbs as adversely as other areas of the United States, it has caused an increase in unemployment and business failures and a decline in property values. As a result, if our market area should suffer another economic downturn, it may more severely affect our business and financial condition than it affects larger bank competitors. In particular, due to the proximity of our market area to Washington, D.C., decreases in spending by the Federal government or threatened cuts to Federal government employment could impact us to a greater degree than banking companies that serve a larger or a different geographical area. Our larger competitors, for example, serve more geographically diverse market areas, parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that may exist in our market area. Further, unexpected changes in the national and local economy may adversely affect our ability to attract deposits and to make loans. Such risks are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the value of our securities.\nWe originate and retain in our portfolio residential mortgage loans. A downturn in the local real estate market and economy could adversely affect earnings. Our loan portfolio includes residential mortgage loans that we originate. Although the local real estate market and economy in our market areas have performed better than many other markets during the past few years, a downturn could cause higher unemployment; and more delinquencies, and could adversely affect the value of properties securing loans. In addition, the real estate market may take longer to recover or not recover to previous levels. These risks increase the probability of an adverse impact on our financial results as fewer borrowers would be eligible to borrow and property values could be below necessary levels required for adequate coverage on the requested loan.\nRecent regulations may negatively impact our origination of mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans retain \u201cnot less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage.\u201d The rule, issued in 2014, aligns the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d with the definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d as defined by the CFPB for purposes of its regulations. The final rule became effective on February 23, 2015. Compliance with the final rule was required beginning December 24, 2015 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages, and is required beginning December 24, 2016 with respect to all other classes of asset-backed securities.\nWe depend on the services of key personnel. The loss of any of these personnel could disrupt our operations and our business could suffer. Our success depends substantially on the skills and abilities of our executive management team, including James W. Cornelsen, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph E. Burnett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, John Miller, our Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, and Mark A. Semanie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Cornelsen, Burnett, Miller and Semanie, the existence of such agreements does not assure that we will retain their services. These executives provide valuable services to us and would be difficult to replace.\nAlso, our growth and success and our anticipated future growth and success, in a large part, is due and will continue to be due to the relationships maintained by our banking executives with our customers. The loss of services of one or more of these executives or of other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our business could suffer. The experienced commercial lenders that we have hired are not a party to any employment agreement with us and they could terminate their employment with us at any time and for any reason.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to attract new deposits, identify loan and investment opportunities and maintain adequate capital levels. We may also grow through acquisitions of existing financial institutions or branches thereof, as we are doing with the pending merger with DCB. There are no guarantees that our expansion strategies will be successful. Also, in order to effectively manage our anticipated and/or actual loan growth we have made and may continue to make additional investments in equipment and personnel, which could increase our non-interest expense. If we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio. Management, through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio, even under normal economic conditions, we cannot predict such losses with certainty. The unprecedented volatility experienced in the financial and capital markets during the last several years makes this determination even more difficult as processes we use to estimate the allowance for loan losses may no longer be dependable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions that may not be accurate. As a result, we cannot be sure that our allowance is or will be adequate in the future. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, our earnings will suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise approximately 80.22% of our loan portfolio. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate or consumer loans and typically have larger balances than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. A deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. Such an increase could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates and changes in monetary policy may impact us. Our results of operations depend to a large extent on our \u201cnet interest income,\u201d which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities, such as interest on deposit accounts, and the interest income received from our interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities. Interest rates, because they are influenced by, among other things, expectations about future events, including the level of economic activity, federal monetary and fiscal policy, and geopolitical stability, are not predictable or controllable. Additionally, competitive factors heavily influence the interest rates we can earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates we pay on our deposits. Community banks are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional, super regional or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets. These factors influence our ability to maintain a stable net interest margin.\nWe seek to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during any period so that we may reasonably predict our net interest margin. Interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production and deposit flows, however, are constantly changing and influence our ability to maintain this neutral position. Generally speaking, our earnings are more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates the greater the variance in the volume of assets and liabilities that mature and reprice in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of interest rates, and whether we are more asset than liability sensitive. Accordingly, we may not be successful in maintaining this neutral position and, as a result, our net interest margin may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition that could adversely affect our growth and operating results. We operate in a competitive market for financial services and face intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Many of these financial institutions have been in business for many years, are significantly larger, and have established customer bases and greater financial resources and lending limits than we do, and are able to offer certain services that we are not able to offer. There are also a number of smaller community-based banks that pursue operating strategies similar to ours. Competitive pressures will also likely continue to build as the financial services industry continues to consolidate and as additional non-bank investment and financial services options for consumers\nbecome available and consumers become increasingly comfortable using such alternatives. If we cannot attract deposits and make loans at a sufficient level, our operating results will suffer, as will our opportunities for growth.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that they have historically held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, which may increase as consumers become more comfortable with these new technologies and offerings, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by new or modified products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market value of our investments could negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity. We have designated all of our investment securities portfolio (or 11.6% of total assets) at December 31, 2016 as available for sale. We \u201cmark to market\u201d temporary unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available for sale portfolio and reflect this adjustment as a separate item in stockholders\u2019 equity, net of taxes. As of December 31, 2016, we had temporary unrealized losses in our available for sale portfolio of $5.0 million (net of taxes). As a result of the recent economic recession and the continued economic slowdown, several municipalities continue to report budget deficits and companies continue to report lower earnings. These budget deficits and lower earnings could cause temporary and other than temporary impairment charges in our investment securities portfolio and cause us to report lower net income and a decline in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur future acquisitions, if any, may cause us to become more susceptible to adverse economic events. While we currently have no agreements to acquire additional financial institutions, other than DCB, we may do so in the future if an attractive acquisition opportunity arises that is consistent with our business plan. Any future business acquisitions could be material to us, and the degree of success achieved in acquiring and integrating these businesses into Old Line Bancshares could have a material effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, any acquisition could require us to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, we could become more susceptible to future economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nWe face limits on our ability to lend. The amount of our capital limits the amount that we can loan to a single borrower. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. As of December 31, 2016, we were able to lend approximately $25.6 million to any one borrower. This amount is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our legal lending limit from doing business with us. We generally try to accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain customers seeking larger loans and we may not be able to sell participations in such loans on terms we consider favorable.\nAdditional capital may not be available when needed or required by regulatory authorities. Federal and state regulatory authorities require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance future acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or our regulators may require that we raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on\nconditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Conditions in the capital markets may be such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms if we needed to raise additional capital. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing stockholders. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on desirable terms, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not have adequately assessed the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we record assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values on the purchase date. The determination of fair value requires that we consider a number of factors including the remaining life of the acquired loans and deposits, estimated prepayments or withdrawals, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and the net present value of expected cash flows. Actual deviations from these predicted cash flows, maturities or repayments or the underlying value of the collateral may mean that our present value determination is inaccurate. This may cause fluctuations in interest income, non-interest income, provision expense, interest expense and non-interest expense and negatively impact our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89938, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OLBK"}
