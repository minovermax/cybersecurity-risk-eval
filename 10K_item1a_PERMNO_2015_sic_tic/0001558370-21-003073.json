RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Company and its Banking Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global economic downturn which has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruptions to the economy and continues to cause economic disruption both worldwide and in the markets we operate, as well as a destabilization effect on financial markets. The ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Our business is dependent upon the ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions, including the payment of loan obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to disrupt the business, activities, and operations of our customers, which may cause a decline in demand for our products and services which may, in turn, result in a significant decrease in our business, negatively impacting our liquidity position and financial results.\nIn order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we have modified our business practices, including implementing work-from-home initiatives for employees when possible and ceasing non-essential business-related travel. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward. We cannot predict the level of disruption which will occur going forward to our employee\u2019s ability to provide customer support and service. Similarly, if any of our vendors or business partners become unable to continue to provide their products and services, which we rely upon to maintain our day-to-day operations, our ability to serve our customers could be impacted.\nThe extent of these impacts will depend on future developments, including among others, governmental, regulatory and private sector actions and responses, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, and actions taken to contain or prevent further spread, each of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Moreover, although multiple COVID-19 vaccines have received regulatory approval and currently are being distributed to certain at-risk populations, it is too early to know how quickly these vaccines can be distributed to the broader population and how effective they will be in mitigating the adverse social and economic effects of the pandemic. Further, variant strains of the COVID-19 virus have appeared, further complicating efforts of the medical community and federal, state and local governments in response to the pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.\nWe are subject to risks associated with geographic and customer concentration in our lending operations, which could negatively impact our asset quality.\nA majority our loan portfolio involves borrowers or collateral located in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and our business strategy is to continue to focus on commercial customers located in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Our relatively small geographic footprint limits our ability to diversify macro-economic risk, so we are less able to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions than larger financial institutions. Accordingly, in the event of adverse changes affecting the Atlanta market generally, or affecting Atlanta to a greater degree than a broader regional or national market as a whole, we will be exposed to risks related to increases in loan delinquencies among Atlanta-based borrowers, increases in problem assets and foreclosures, decreases in the demand for our products and services, decreases in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, located in Atlanta, and related decreases in customers\u2019 borrowing power. In addition, because of our commercial lending focus, we may be dependent on a smaller number of larger loan relationships, in which case our credit quality would be disproportionately impacted by deterioration of one or more large individual credit exposures. Adverse changes in the Atlanta market or impacting large loan relationships could require us to record increased allowance for loan losses, restructure loans or foreclose on and sell collateral. Even an increased allowance may be inadequate to cover loan losses, the terms of restructured loans may contain terms less favorable to us, borrowers under restructured loans may continue to be delinquent, and we may not be able to sell foreclosed collateral on favorable terms, any of which would cause us to suffer credit losses. In addition, a significant increase in classified assets or credit losses could result in our regulators imposing restrictions on our operations, which could limit our ability to execute our business strategy. Any of these occurrences would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with customer concentration in our deposit base, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nOur strategy involves continued solicitation of and reliance on larger deposits from our business customers. Accordingly, a significant deterioration of financial condition of relatively few of our depositors could cause those depositors to maintain lower balances, which would have an adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s liquidity and profitability. As a result, we may be required to raise interest rates on deposits in an effort to attract deposits and thus incur increased interest expense, or to seek liquidity funding from borrowings or other sources on terms less favorable than current deposit rates. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nA key focus of our strategy is originating commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Because our loan portfolio consists largely of these types of loans, our portfolio carries a higher degree of risk than would a portfolio with larger amounts of other types of loans. These loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and as of December 31, 2020, we had $909.1million of commercial real estate loans and $952.8 million of commercial and industrial loans outstanding, representing 40% and 42%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. These types of loans have historically driven the growth in our loan portfolio, and we intend to continue our lending efforts for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial products.\nCommercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans may present a greater risk of non-payment by a borrower than other types of loans. They typically involve larger loan balances and are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the related commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of a commercial loan in comparison to other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, commercial loan customers often have the ability to fund current interest payments through additional borrowings, and as a result the actual credit risk associated with these customers may be worse than anticipated. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which means that an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss. In the case of commercial\nand industrial loans, collateral often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, which may not yield substantial recovery of principal losses incurred, and is susceptible to deterioration or other loss in advance of liquidation of such collateral. These loans may lack standardized terms and may include a balloon payment feature. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions and prevailing interest rates.\nWe offer land acquisition and development and construction loans for builders and developers, and as of December 31, 2020, we had $145.6 million in such loans outstanding, representing 6% of total loans outstanding. Similar to commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, land acquisition and development and construction loans are riskier than other types of loans. The primary credit risks associated with land acquisition and development and construction lending are underwriting and project risks. Project risks include cost overruns, borrower credit risk, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk, and environmental and other hazard risks. Market risks are risks associated with rental or sale of the completed projects. They include affordability risk, which means the risk that borrowers cannot obtain affordable financing or that renters cannot afford rents at the projects, product design risk, and risks posed by competing projects.\nBecause of the risks associated with commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and acquisition and development and construction loans, we may experience higher rates of default than a portfolio more heavily weighted towards smaller or residential mortgage loans. Losses in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, or construction and land loan portfolio could exceed our reserves, which would adversely impact our capital and earnings.\nLending to small businesses, franchisees and high-growth businesses may expose us to additional risks not present in lending to larger business customers.\nWe focus on lending to small businesses, including franchise businesses and customers in certain high-growth industries. Small business customers generally have fewer financial resources and are more vulnerable to declines in economic conditions than larger, better capitalized businesses with longer operating histories. Businesses in high-growth industries such as financial technology require ongoing capital to support their growth, invest in product development, and attract and retain highly skilled employees. These businesses may not generate income sufficient to provide that capital, and may not be able to raise required levels of capital, which may result in them increasing debt financing. Franchisee borrowers may incur greater costs than other small businesses as a result of complying with operational or other requirements imposed by franchisors, and may not have the ability to respond to local market forces to the same extent as independently operated small businesses or larger businesses. Franchisees in the retail industry are susceptible to changes in labor costs and generally do not have significant amounts of collateral to secure loans. In addition, the success of franchise businesses is highly dependent on the reputation of the franchisor compared to the franchisor\u2019s competitors. Franchisors may not provide financial support to franchisees, so franchise businesses may be more susceptible to downturns in the local or national economy than larger businesses supported by a parent organization. Conversely, where franchisors do provide financial support, events negatively impacting the franchisor globally or nationally will impact otherwise successful individual franchisees. In addition, franchisors may grant a number of franchise licenses that exceeds market demand for their products or services in a particular geographic area, and may revoke franchise license of franchisees for poor performance or other reasons. The occurrence of any of these or other events impacting our franchise and high-growth business customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSBA lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent on the federal government and our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, and we face risks associated with originating and selling SBA loans.\nOur SBA lending program is dependent upon the policies and oversight of the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender\u2019s Program (an \u201cSBA Preferred Lender\u201d), we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans more efficiently. The SBA periodically reviews our lending operations to assess, among other things, whether we comply with program rules and whether we exhibit prudent risk management. If the SBA were to identify weakness in our procedures or our risk management policies, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of our SBA Preferred Lender status. In addition, the federal government may make changes to the SBA program, including but not limited to changes to the level of guarantee provided by the federal government on SBA loans, changes to program specific rules impacting eligibility under the guarantee program, limits on fees lenders may\nimpose, and changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress or funding for the SBA program. In addition, any default by the federal government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could impede our ability to originate SBA loans, sell such loans in the secondary market, or collect under SBA loan guarantees. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability.\nWe generally sell the guaranteed portion of loans that we originate under the SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan Program in the secondary market and retain the servicing rights to the loans that we sell. These sales result in premium income for us at the time of sale and create a stream of future servicing income. For any of the reasons noted above, we may be unable to continue originating these loans or selling them in the secondary market, and premiums may decline due to economic and competitive factors. In addition, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of these loans, and if a customer defaults on a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the loan, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us. Claims of this sort could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have originated a significant number of loans under the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, which may result in a large number of such loans remaining on our consolidated balance sheets at a very low yield for an extended period of time.\nThe SBA PPP, originally established under the CARES Act and extended under the Economic Aid Act, authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1% per annum and a maturity of two years for loans originated prior to June 5, 2020 and five years for loans originated on or after June 5, 2020.\nUnder the SBA\u2019s PPP, such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to their employees and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds. The initial phase of the PPP was extended multiple times by Congress and eventually expired on August 8, 2020. On January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for First Draw PPP loans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. Further, on January 13, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for Second Draw loans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that did receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. At least $25 billion has been set aside for Second Draw PPP loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of 10 employees or for loans of $250,000 or less to eligible borrowers in low or moderate income neighborhoods. Generally speaking, business with more than 300 employees and/or less than a 25 percent reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020 are not eligible for Second Draw loans. Further, maximum loan amounts have been increased for accommodation and food service businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had PPP loans with outstanding balances of $192.2 million. Due to the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the beginning of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Because of this, the loans under this program may present potential fraud risk, increasing the risk that loan forgiveness may not be obtained by the borrowers and that the guarantee by SBA may not be honored. Additionally, because the loan forgiveness requires the borrower to meet certain criteria for the use of the proceeds after the loan is originated, there is a risk the borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness due to the borrower\u2019s conduct after the loan origination. Further, although the SBA has recently streamlined the loan forgiveness process for loans $50,000 or less, it has taken longer than initially anticipated for the SBA to finalize the forgiveness processes. On January 19, 2021, the SBA increased the streamlined loan forgiveness process to loans $150,000 or less. Thus, absent regulatory relief, extended forbearance waiting times due to SBA-related delays are likely. These factors may result in us having to hold a significant amount of these low-yield loans on our books for a significant period of time. Additionally, the PPP loans are not secured by an interest in a borrower's assets or otherwise backed by personal guarantees. We will continue to face increased operational demands and pressures as we monitor and service our book of PPP loans, process applications for loan forgiveness and pursue recourse under the SBA guarantees and against borrowers for PPP loan defaults.\nOur growing deposit and processing focused business may expose us to additional risks not associated with the provision of core banking products and services.\nOne of our areas of strategic focus is investing in the growth of our deposit and processing focused business, particularly financial technology, payment processing and treasury management services. Because some of our products and services are delivered to customers through selective partnerships with financial technology companies, developments that negatively impact our partners will indirectly impact us. These industries are subject to rapid technological advancements, including the development of enhanced products and services by our competitors, which include both established financial institutions and newer specialized service providers; internalization of certain functions by our customers; and the development of industry-wide solutions and standards, which may render any product or service obsolete and which will require us and our partners to continually refine our product and services offerings. The competitive landscape for our customers and partners in these industries changes rapidly due to consolidation and changes in relationships between companies providing complimentary services. Moreover, the needs and preferences of our customers will change as their businesses evolve and as they adopt new and more varied technology for business uses. We are committed to growing this aspect of our business; however, unforeseen increases in transaction volume resulting from industry consolidation, changes in the competitive landscape for our customers and other changes in our customers\u2019 businesses could result in growth that we are unable to manage effectively. In addition, the regulations and standards applicable to these industries are evolving, and new regulations or standards may negatively impact the efficiency or utility of the products and services we offer, or require us to invest additional resources to adapt our products and services to be compliant with those regulations and standards. In particular, customers in certain industries, such as payment processing, pose heightened compliance risks with respect to anti-money laundering and similar regulations and regulations related to information security. The failure by us or our partners to anticipate or respond to changes in these industries, comply with applicable regulations, or protect customer information could result in our customers responding negatively to the products and services that we offer, reputational damage, loss of competitive advantages, increased expenses associated with lawsuits and remediation efforts, or the imposition by our regulators of fines or restrictions on our ability to conduct these businesses, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulatory changes related to widely used reference interest rates could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, the value of our loans and other financial instruments, and our interest rate risk.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Although alternative reference rates have been proposed, the scope of acceptance of any such reference rate and the impact on calculated rates, pricing and the ability to manage risk, including through derivatives, remain uncertain. We have a significant number of floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods or if we are required to utilize alternative reference rates, interest rates on, and revenue and expenses associated with, those financial instruments may be adversely affected. Additionally, timing differences and different definitions of any new benchmark could create mismatches which would negatively impact interest income, interest rate risk management and liquidity.\nOn November 30, 2020 the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the one-week and two-month settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the FRB, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has selected SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nThe U.S. federal banking agencies issued a statement in November 2020 encouraging banks to transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR as soon as practicable and to stop entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR by December 31, 2021. SOFR or other alternative reference rates may perform differently than LIBOR in response to changing market conditions. For example, SOFR could experience greater decreases during times of economic stress, which could require us to lend at lower rates at times when our borrowing costs are increasing.\nOur management of the transition from LIBOR may prompt changes in accounting treatment, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, hedging strategy and product design and offerings, all of which could cause us to incur significant expense. Reliance on \u201cfallback\u201d provisions also could result in customer uncertainty and disputes regarding how variable rates should be calculated, and negotiations with customers and counterparties regarding the calculation of interest will cause us to incur significant expense. If we are unable to successfully negotiate calculations, amend loans on terms that are satisfactory to our customers, or are unable to adequately hedge risks related to certain customers, we could experience a loss of customers and reputational damage. Any of these risks, and our failure to adequately manage the transition from LIBOR generally, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic downturn in the commercial loan market, the commercial real estate industry, and/or in our markets generally could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf the communities in which the Bank operates do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. The economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in delinquencies and loans on non-accrual status across all of our loan portfolios, particularly our commercial loan portfolio and commercial real estate portfolio, as certain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely affected the ability of many of our borrowers to repay their loans. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial loan portfolio includes $204.7 of outstanding balances, representing 9% of total loans, to borrowers in key industries which may see elevated risk as a result of the current economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAn economic recession over a prolonged period or other economic problems in our market areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services. Future adverse changes in the economies in our market areas may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond our control. If market conditions deteriorate, our non-performing assets may increase and we may need to take valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for loan losses and our methodology for calculating the allowance are fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 under \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses,\u201d and in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section. In general, an increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income, and possibly risk-based capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments that are different than those of management. As we are continually adjusting our loan portfolio and underwriting standards to reflect current market conditions, we can provide no assurance that our methodology will not change, which could result in a charge to earnings.\nWe continually reassess the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses as part of the Bank\u2019s credit functions. Any significant amount of additional non-performing assets, loan charge-offs, increases in the provision for loan losses or any inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan\ndefault, will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover future credit losses.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, the FASB\u2019s CECL accounting standard became effective on January 1, 2020 and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard removes the existing \u201cprobable\u201d threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nIn March 2020, the federal banking agencies released an interim final rule, subsequently adopted as a final rule in August 2020, which allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period and at the end of the two years the impact is then phased in over the following three years. Under the rule, during 2020 and 2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital reflects the change in retained earnings upon initial adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, plus 25% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020. Then beginning January 2022, the impact is phased in over the following three years. We did not elect to apply this phase-in.\nThe adoption of CECL may also impact our ongoing earnings, perhaps materially, due in part to changes in loan portfolio composition, changes in credit metrics, and changes in the macroeconomic forecast. Our ability to accurately forecast the future economic environment could result in volatility in the provision as a result of the new accounting standard. See Note 1 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure on the impact to the allowance at adoption.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to GAAP, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings and our financial condition could be negatively impacted to the extent the information furnished to us by and on behalf of borrowers is not correct or complete or is noncompliant with GAAP.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s results of operations are affected by policies of the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets and the economic and political situations in certain parts of the world, we cannot predict with certainty possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the U.S. government and other governments in responding to\nterrorist attacks or events in these or other regions may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability.\nOur earnings are significantly dependent on our net interest income, as we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We are unable to predict future fluctuations in interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, economic growth, employment rates, fiscal and monetary policy and disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key interest driver rates, as well as balance sheet growth, customer loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables. Our net interest income also may decline based on our exposure to a difference in short-term and long-term interest rates. A relatively high cost for securing deposits, combined with lower interest rates that can be charged on customer loans, will place downward pressure on our net interest income. Our asset-liability management strategy may not be effective in preventing changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks in the event of certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity position and results of operations.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of certain borrower defaults, which could adversely affect our liquidity position, results of operations, and financial condition. Prior to the exit of our mortgage banking business in connection with the Branch Sale, when we sold mortgage loans, we were required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which the loans were originated. In the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties related to a loan sold, we could be liable for damages to the investor up to and including a \u201cmake whole\u201d demand that involves, at the investor\u2019s option, either reimbursing the investor for actual losses incurred on the loan or repurchasing the loan in full. Our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of a make whole loan repurchase claim would be the unpaid principal balance of the loan to be repurchased along with any premium paid by the investor when the loan was purchased and other collection cost reimbursements. If repurchase demands increase, our liquidity position, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAtlantic Capital may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cACBI\u201d. Although we anticipate that our capital resources will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our capital requirements, at times we may depend on the liquidity of the Nasdaq market to raise equity capital. If the market should fail to operate, or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse, we may be constrained in raising capital. Downgrades in the opinions of the analysts that follow us may cause our stock price to fall and significantly limit our ability to access the markets for additional capital requirements. Should these risks materialize, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisition may be limited.\nNegative publicity about financial institutions, generally, or about the Company or the Bank, specifically, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our liquidity, business operations or financial results.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from the actual or alleged conduct of financial institutions, generally, or our Company or the Bank, specifically, in any number of activities, including leasing and lending practices, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators in response to those activities. Negative publicity can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action, any of which could negatively affect our liquidity, business operations or financial results.\nCertain changes in interest rates, inflation, deflation or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our results of operations and cash flows.\nLoan originations, and potentially loan revenues, could be materially adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates. Conversely, sharply falling rates could increase prepayments within our securities portfolio and fixed rate loans lowering interest earnings. An unanticipated increase in inflation could cause our operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nThe fair market value of our securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. In addition, in a low interest rate environment, loan customers often pursue long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely affect our earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of our loans and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to increases in nonperforming assets, charge-offs and delinquencies, further increases to the allowance for loan losses, and a reduction of income recognized, among others, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the orderly function of our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of an economic downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us or our region, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nWe face strong competition from larger, more established competitors that may inhibit our ability to compete. The Atlanta market area has experienced consolidation and disruption that may increase competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience strong competition from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other financial institutions, which operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions in attracting deposits and making loans. In addition, we primarily have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We also compete with these institutions in recruiting employees who are critical to our success. Many of our competitors are well-established and much larger financial institutions. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size and relative lack of geographic diversification.\nThe Atlanta market area has experienced significant consolidation and disruption in recent periods. This could result in increased competition as both established institutions and new market entrants position themselves to attract new customers and quality employees. Because we operate exclusively in the Atlanta metropolitan market and surrounding areas, increases in competition in our market area will impact us to a greater degree than if we were more geographically\ndiversified. In addition, because we focus on small and medium sized commercial enterprises, increases in competition for those types of customers will impact us to a greater degree than if we were focused on providing banking services to larger more established business customers engaged in a broader range of commercial endeavors. Finally, because we are not as large as some of our current and potential competitors, we may not be able to successfully compete with other institutions in our market in attracting and retaining the numbers of employees with the skill sets or business relationships necessary to support our planned growth.\nUnpredictable economic conditions, public health emergencies, political crises, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nCertain events that are beyond our control, such as an overall economic downturn, public health emergency (such as the coronavirus pandemic), terrorist attack, political crisis, economic policies (such as trade restrictions, trade agreements and tariffs), extreme weather, or natural disaster, whether occurring in our markets or globally, could adversely impact our customers and therefore our operations and profitability. For example, our construction and development borrowers could be impacted by shortages or price increases of building materials, our commercial and industrial borrowers could be impacted by reduced demand for their products or by interruptions in global, national or regional supply chains critical to their operations, and our local retail borrowers could be impacted by reduced foot traffic. In addition, our partners who provide certain services related to our financial technology, payment processing and treasury management services may have national or global operations that expose them to the impact of such events occurring outside of our market area. Any negative impact on our customers or our partners could result in interruption in delivery of our services, reduced demand for our products and services, increased loan delinquencies, declines in the value of collateral, and decreases in the levels and duration of customer deposits. Furthermore, because our customers and the collateral securing our loans are concentrated in the Atlanta metropolitan area, any event that is specific to Atlanta or the southeastern United States, or that has a disparate impact on our market areas, may affect us and our profitability to a greater degree than our more geographically diversified competitors. The impact of any of these events on our customers or on us directly would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including counterparties in the financial industry, such as commercial banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions will expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, this credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon liquidation or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEnvironmental liability associated with lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing our loans. If hazardous substances are discovered on any of these properties, we may be liable to governmental entities or third parties for the costs of remediation of the hazard, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Many environmental laws impose liability regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site, even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially limit the use of properties that we acquire through foreclosure, reduce their value or limit our ability to sell them in the event of a default on the loans they secure. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability.\nOur loan policies requiring certain due diligence of high risk industries and properties may not be effective in reducing the risks of environmental liability resulting from non-performing loan and/or foreclosed property.\nWe may not be able to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals in key positions throughout the organization. Competition for qualified individuals in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we want and/or need. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain key employees, and have incentive compensation plans aimed, in part, at long-term employee retention, the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur, and such events may have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of the employee\u2019s skills, knowledge of our market, and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals in key positions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, or damage our reputation.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our Internet banking system, treasury management products, check and document imaging, remote deposit capture systems, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nThere has been an increase in the number and sophistication of criminal cyber-security attacks against companies where customer and other sensitive information has been compromised. The financial services industry has experienced an increase in the number and severity of cyber-attacks, including efforts to hack or breach security measures in order to access, obtain or misuse information, misappropriate financial assets, corrupt or destroy data, disrupt operations, or install viruses, \u201cransomware\u201d or other malware. Although we devote significant resources to maintaining the integrity of our systems, we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The protective policies and procedures we currently have in place or which we implement in the future may not be sufficient as the nature and sophistication of such threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nIn addition, our business operations rely on third party vendors to provide services such as exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries, data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. The cyber-security, information and operational risks that our third party service providers face may be different than the risks we face, and we do not directly control any of such service providers\u2019 information security operations, including the efforts that they may take to mitigate risks or the level of cyber/privacy liability insurance that they may carry. Any problems caused or experienced by these third parties, including cyber-attacks and security breaches, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense.\nAny failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems, or the systems operated by our third party service providers, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, impair our ability to provide our services or maintain availability of our systems to customers, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, subject us to regulatory enforcement or other actions, or expose us to remediation costs, increased insurance premiums, civil litigation,\nfines, penalties or losses not covered by insurance. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on technology, and an inability to invest in technological improvements or obtain reliable technology and technological support may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. We depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their operational needs. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and third-party support. There can be no assurance that we will effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market these products and services to our customers. We also rely on our computer systems. For example, we rely on our computer systems to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities. If our computer systems become unreliable, fail or experience a breach of security, our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $22.7 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank faces risks related to the adoption of future legislation and potential changes in federal agency leadership, policies, and priorities.\nThe level of regulatory scrutiny that we are subject to may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors, including as a result of the new U.S. presidential administration and Democratic majority in Congress. The prospects for the enactment of banking reform legislation under the new Congress are unclear at this time. The turnover of the presidential administration has produced, and likely will continue to produce, certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies, the CFPB, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, and the Treasury Department. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC Board of Directors may experience significant turnover within the next year to two years. These changes could impact the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.\nAs Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes, our business could be affected in substantial and unpredictable ways. Material changes in regulation and requirements imposed on financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Capital Rules, could result in additional costs, impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and increase the ability of non-bank financial services providers to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Such changes could result in new regulatory obligations which could prove difficult, expensive or competitively impractical to comply with if not equally imposed upon non-bank financial services providers with whom we compete.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA\u2019s PPP, we are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of the program and on our compliance with their requirements.\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions related to COVID-19, including the SBA\u2019s PPP. We participated as a lender in the PPP, providing $234 million in loans to over 800 customers. As of December 31, 2020, we had PPP loans with outstanding balances of $192.2 million.\nWe understand that PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and believe the majority of these loans will be forgiven. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if we have already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from us of any loss related to the deficiency.\nDue to the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the beginning of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Several other large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans and our PPP process. Any such litigation filed against the Company or the Bank may be costly, regardless of the outcome, and result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nFrom time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, represented a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation, and additional rules and regulations that have been promulgated since then, significantly changed the federal income tax landscape. Although, the legislation reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% and made other changes that have favorably impacted our overall U.S. federal tax liability, it also included a number of provisions that have and will continue to negatively impact our overall U.S. federal tax liability, including, but not limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), the imposition of taxes on certain cross-border payments or transfers, the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character, and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances). The legislation also made significant changes to the tax rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business. Additional guidance is expected to continue to be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Treasury, or other governing bodies that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. Additionally, there is no assurance that the current or anticipated benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be realized in future periods. Any tax benefits could be repealed as a result of future political or regulatory actions, including as a result of changes proposed by the new U.S. presidential administration. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the SEC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans, including our ability to branch, offer certain products or execute\nexisting or planned business strategies or could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation and brand. Such regulation includes various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations.\nFor example, certain of our business is subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA:\n\u25cf imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers\u2019 nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties;\n\u25cf requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of the institution\u2019s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and\n\u25cf requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.\nMoreover, various United States federal regulatory agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach.\nWe also maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT ACT. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary.\nCompliance with current or future regulations to which we are subject, including but not limited to regulations related to privacy, information security and data protection laws and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing, could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Changing regulations could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives, or, if we fail to comply, result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation and brand.\nWe are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the FASB. Changes in accounting rules could materially adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us.\nRegulators periodically examine our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations, and we may become subject to other regulatory agency examinations in the future. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may require us to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth by preventing us from acquiring other financial institutions or limiting our ability to expand our business by engaging in new activities, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to\nassess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nLimited trading in our common stock may impact the ability of shareholders to sell their shares and the price of our common stock.\nTrading activity in our common stock may be limited. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, the market price of our common stock may be adversely impacted. This may make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares at a favorable price or to sell their shares at all. In addition, any negative impact on the price or liquidity of our common stock may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by offering and selling additional shares and our ability to use our common stock as consideration in future acquisitions.\nWe are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are therefore subject to the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and certain other increased disclosure and governance requirements.\nAs of January 1, 2021, we lost our status as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we are no longer able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements. Therefore, we are now subject to certain requirements that apply to other public companies that did not previously apply to us, due to our previous status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u25cf compliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf compliance with any new rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf compliance with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies without an extended transition period;\n\u25cf full disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; and\n\u25cf compliance with the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions by the SEC, divert management\u2019s attention, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In particular, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to render the required attestation, it could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our financial reports. With the loss of \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status, we expect to incur significant costs as a result of complying with additional compliance and reporting requirements, and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with additional reporting requirements. Such initiatives and requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur stock repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value and stock repurchases, if any, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nIn March 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to $25 million of its issued and outstanding common stock and terminated the previous program, which was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased $23.5 million, or 1,643,124 shares of common stock, of which 1,338,858 shares totaling $17.7 million were purchased under the new stock buyback program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available cash, and other\nmarket conditions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which impacts our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, support our operations, invest in securities and pay dividends and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. Stock repurchases may not enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nA number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to be volatile or to decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u25cfactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cfchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other financial institutions;\n\u25cffailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u25cfspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cfstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cfactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u25cffluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cfgeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u25cfproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cfanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us or the financial services industry; or\n\u25cfdomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe holders of our subordinated notes have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $75.0 million of subordinated notes outstanding. The subordinated notes are senior to shares of our common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the subordinated notes before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. Our ability to pay future distributions depends upon the earnings of the Bank and the issuance of dividends from the Bank to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations.\nWe may borrow funds or issue additional debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock, common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate with certainty the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable\nterms for the issuance of our securities in the future. In addition, the borrowing of funds or the issuance of debt would increase our leverage and decrease our liquidity, and the issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited.\nOur primary source of cash is dividends we receive from the Bank. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. Atlantic Capital has not historically paid dividends to shareholders and did not pay dividends in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, banks and bank holding companies are subject to significant regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Our future dividend policy will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, regulatory requirements and other factors that the boards of directors of the Company and the Bank consider relevant.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIn the future, should we need additional capital to support our business, expand our operations or maintain our minimum capital requirements, we may not be able to raise additional funds. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance at that time. We cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we borrow money to provide capital to the Bank, we must obtain prior regulatory approvals, and we may not be able to pay this debt and could default. We cannot provide assurance that funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all.", "PERMNO": 15709, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ACBI"}
