The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about currently, or that we currently believe are not material, may also adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMacroeconomic and Workplace Trends Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts have had, and may continue to have, a significant and adverse effect on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by various governments and third parties to combat the spread of COVID-19 caused many office workers globally to work from home for extended periods of time over the past two years, which had a significant negative impact on global demand for office furniture and our revenue. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 and related government restrictions over the past two years have had a negative impact on the availability of manufacturing, transportation and logistics labor and our manufacturing and our suppliers' operations. As a result, during 2022, we experienced:\n\u2022significant inflation in the costs of raw materials and components used in our products, transportation and logistics, and\n\u2022significant supply chain disruptions, including constraints on the availability of certain raw materials and components on both a short-term and long-term basis, labor shortages and shipping delays.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been far-reaching, and while we have seen improvement in demand for our products as people have increasingly returned to the office, the duration and intensity of the impacts of the pandemic on our business, our industry and the global economy may not yet be fully known.\nOur industry is influenced by cyclical macroeconomic factors and future downturns may adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nOur revenue is generated predominantly from the office furniture industry, and demand for office furniture is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment, white-collar employment and commercial office construction and vacancy rates. The U.S. and European office furniture industries have experienced three major declines in demand in the past twenty years, driven by global economic downturns. During these downturns, our revenue declined substantially and our profitability was significantly reduced. Our revenues and profitability can be, and currently are being, impacted by adverse changes in these macroeconomic factors. Macroeconomic factors are difficult to predict, and if we are unsuccessful in further adapting our business as economic cyclical changes occur, our results may be adversely affected.\nFailure to respond to changes in workplace trends and the competitive landscape may adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nAdvances in technology, changing workforce demographics, increased working from home (in particular, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), shifts in work styles and behaviors and the globalization of business have been changing the world of work and impacting the types of workplace products and services purchased by our customers. In recent years, these trends have resulted in changes such as:\n\u2022an increase in hybrid work, and the demand for products that support individual privacy and focused work,\n\u2022an increase in demand for products for working from home, including those that enhance remote work experiences,\n\u2022an increase in demand for residential and lounge products for office settings,\n\u2022more frequent refreshment of workplace settings,\n\u2022customer interest in a broader range of price points, quality and warranty coverage, and\n\u2022shifting demand among product categories.\nThese trends have also had an impact on our competitive landscape, including (1) the emergence of smaller office furniture competitors, (2) increased competition from residential furniture and technology companies, (3) diversification by some of our larger competitors into other industries and (4) an increase in customers outsourcing workplace management to real estate management service firms and flexible real estate providers.\nWe compete on a variety of factors, including: brand recognition and reputation; insights from our research; the breadth of our global reach and product portfolio; product design and features; price, lead time, delivery and service; product quality; strength of our dealer network and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers and real estate managers. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to develop and offer a wide variety of solutions which respond to changes in workplace trends, or if we or our dealers are unsuccessful in competing with existing competitors and new competitive offerings which arise from outside our industry, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop, implement and manage our growth strategies.\nOur longer-term success depends on our ability to successfully develop, implement and manage our growth strategies, which include:\n\u2022developing offerings to support hybrid work, including enhanced applications to support individual privacy and focused work and partnering with technology companies to create integrated collaborative solutions,\n\u2022enhancing our capabilities to serve the work-from-home and retail markets,\n\u2022growing our market share with existing dealers and customers in addition to serving smaller and mid-sized customers and growing our market share in learning and healthcare environments,\n\u2022realizing the value from acquisitions and investing in new acquisitions and business ventures, and\n\u2022increasing growth opportunities in our Asia Pacific business, including India and China.\nIf these strategies to increase our revenues are not sufficient, or if we do not execute these strategies successfully, our global market share and profitability may be adversely affected.\nManufacturing, Supply Chain and Distribution Risk Factors\nWe are and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in raw material, commodity and other input costs.\nWe and our suppliers purchase raw materials (including steel, petroleum-based products (including plastics and foam), aluminum, other metals, wood and particleboard) from a significant number of sources globally. These raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry. The costs of these commodities, as well as fuel, freight, energy, labor and other input costs can fluctuate due to changes in global, regional or local supply and demand, larger currency movements and changes in tariffs and trade barriers, which can also cause supply interruptions.\nDuring 2022, there was a significant increase in the costs of many of the raw materials used by our suppliers and us, including steel and other commodities, as a result of availability constraints, supply chain disruption, increased demand, labor shortages and other factors.\nIn the short-term, significant increases in raw material, commodity and other input costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of existing contractual commitments with our customers, and it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against such changes. As a result, our gross margins can be adversely affected in the short-term by significant increases in these costs. During 2022, we announced three list price increases as a result of the significant inflation, compared to our historical practice of announcing not more than one list price increase per year. If we are not successful in passing along higher raw material, commodity and other input costs to our customers over the longer-term, because of competitive pressures, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nWe are reliant on a global network of suppliers that exposes us to certain risks outside of our control.\nWe are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials, components and finished goods from a global network of third-party suppliers. The flow of such materials, components and goods may be affected by:\n\u2022fluctuations in the availability and quality of raw materials,\n\u2022disruptions caused by labor shortages and labor activities,\n\u2022ocean freight constraints and port congestion, domestic transportation and logistical challenges,\n\u2022the financial solvency of our suppliers and their supply chains, and\n\u2022damage or loss of production from accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, pandemics, security concerns (including terrorist activity, armed conflict and civil or military unrest), trade embargoes, changes in tariffs, systems and equipment failures or disruptions, cyberattacks or security breaches and other causes.\nAny disruptions or fluctuations in the supply and delivery of raw materials, components and finished goods or deficiencies in our ability to manage our global network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. During 2022, our suppliers were negatively impacted by disruptions and fluctuations in the availability of raw materials, labor, transportation and logistics. These factors led to significant disruptions and delays in the supply of raw materials, components and finished goods to us, which negatively impacted our order lead times and our ability to deliver products to our customers on time, as well as our costs of procuring such items.\nA shortage of qualified and skilled labor has had, and may continue to have, a significant and adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified and talented individuals to manufacture and deliver our products to our dealers and customers, and any shortages in the availability of a skilled workforce to support our operations could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. During 2022, there were shortages of qualified labor in certain locations where we have manufacturing and distribution facilities, which resulted in increased wage costs as a result of actions we took to attract and retain qualified talent, including hiring and referral bonus programs.\nChanges in tariffs, global trade agreements or government procurement could adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture most of our products on a regional basis, and as a result, we often export products from where they are manufactured to where they are sold within the region. We also source raw materials, components and finished goods from a global network of suppliers. In particular in 2022, approximately 34% of the products we sold to customers in the U.S., including U.S. government agencies, were manufactured outside of the U.S., predominantly by our subsidiaries in Mexico, which operate as maquiladoras. Changes in tariffs or trade agreements could impact the cost of importing our products into the countries where they are sold and the cost of raw materials and components sourced from other countries, which in turn could adversely impact our gross margins and our price competitiveness. In addition, changes in U.S. government procurement rules requiring a certain amount of domestic content in goods, or requiring goods to be produced in the U.S., could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe lack of redundant capabilities among our regional manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our products are currently produced in only one location in each of the three geographic regions in which we operate (the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific), certain components are manufactured in only one location globally and our manufacturing model is predominately make-to-order. As a result, any issue which impacts the production capabilities of one of our manufacturing locations, such as natural disasters, severe weather events, pandemics, disruptions in the supply of materials or components, systems and equipment failures or disruptions caused by labor activities, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe rely largely on a network of independent dealers to market, deliver and install our products, and disruptions and increasing consolidations within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to manage our relationships with our independent dealers. From time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate our relationship, or the dealer could face financial insolvency or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership, and establishing a new dealer in a market can take considerable time and resources. Disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealers or the inability to establish new dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty, we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership, which would reduce the risk of disruption but increase our financial exposure. Alternatively, we may elect to purchase and operate dealers in certain markets, which would also require use of our capital and increase our financial exposure.\nWe rely on our dealers to sell, deliver and install products to our customers, and their ability to perform and their financial conditions could be affected by events such as natural disasters, severe weather events, pandemics, systems and equipment failures or disruptions, cyberattacks or security breaches. A significant disruption in the operations of our dealers could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn certain cases, our diversification and growth strategies into adjacent markets are driving the need for our dealers to invest in additional resources to support our products and markets. Some of our smaller dealers do not have the scale to leverage such investments, and as a result, we have seen and may continue to see increased consolidation within our dealer network. This increased concentration and size of dealers could increase our exposure to the risks discussed above.\nGlobal Footprint Risk Factors\nOur global presence subjects us to risks that may negatively affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have manufacturing facilities, sales locations and offices in many countries, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our success depends on our ability to manage the complexity associated with designing, developing, manufacturing and selling our solutions in a variety of countries. Our global presence is also subject to market risks, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition, including:\n\u2022differing business practices, cultural factors and regulatory requirements,\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, natural disasters, pandemics, security concerns, including terrorist activity, armed conflict and civil or military unrest and global crises or health issues, and\n\u2022intellectual property protection challenges.\nOur global footprint makes us vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls.\nWe primarily sell our products in U.S. dollars and euros, but we generate some of our revenues and pay some of our expenses in other currencies. While we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk largely through operational means by matching revenue with same-currency costs, our results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge some of the near-term volatility of these exposures. There can be no assurance that such hedging will be economically effective.\nIf we are not successful in managing currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe operate globally in multiple currencies, but we translate our results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and thus our reported results may be positively or negatively impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the other currencies in which we operate against the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, we face restrictions in certain countries that limit or prevent the transfer of funds to other countries or the exchange of the local currency to other currencies, which could have a negative impact on our profitability. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may lead to a decline in the value of the funds held in certain jurisdictions, as well as the value of intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nWe may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have net goodwill of $242.8 as of February 25, 2022. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in Q4 or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Poor performance in portions of our business where we have goodwill, including failure to achieve projected performance from acquisitions, or declines in the market value of our equity, may result in impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in corporate tax laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of our earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, such tax law changes, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial position. A reduction in applicable tax rates may require us to revalue and write-down our net deferred tax assets. As of February 25, 2022, we had net deferred tax assets of $111.2, and approximately 65% of our net deferred tax assets were subject to recovery in the U.S.\nThere may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to net operating loss (\"NOL\") and tax credit carryforwards totaling $41.2 and $26.2, respectively, against which valuation allowances totaling $2.4 have been recorded. NOL carryforwards are primarily related to foreign jurisdictions. Tax credit carryforwards consist of U.S. foreign tax credits and foreign investment tax credits. We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the jurisdictions in which we maintain deferred tax assets related to NOL and tax credit carryforwards, or implement tax, business or other planning strategies, to fully utilize the recorded value of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards. These deferred tax assets are recorded in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk, which could reduce the amount we may ultimately realize. Additionally, future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our NOL and tax credit carryforwards.\nCosts related to our participation in a multi-employer pension plan could increase.\nOne of our subsidiaries, SC Transport Inc., previously contributed to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (the \"Fund\"), a multi-employer pension plan, based on obligations arising under a collective bargaining agreement that covered SC Transport Inc. employees and retirees. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. In 2019, the Fund asserted that SC Transport Inc.'s absence of hiring additional union employees over the past ten years constituted an adverse selection practice under the Fund and, if not remedied, would result in the assessment of a withdrawal liability. As a result of the Fund\u2019s assertion, SC Transport Inc. recorded a $11.2 charge related to its estimated future obligations under a withdrawal from the Fund.\nIn 2020, SC Transport Inc. withdrew from the Fund, and the Fund issued a final assessment of our withdrawal liability. We appealed the amount of the assessment by the Fund and are awaiting arbitration proceedings. The amount that may ultimately be required to settle any potential obligation may be lower or higher than the estimated liability, which will be adjusted as needed, if and when additional information becomes available. If actual settlements are significantly lower or higher than the estimated reserve, our results of operations may be materially affected. In addition, if the Fund were to experience a mass withdrawal within three years from the date of our withdrawal, our liability could increase by approximately $13.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe rely on the integrity and security of our information technology systems, and our business could be materially adversely impacted by extended disruptions, significant security breaches or other compromises of these systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems to operate and manage our business and to process, maintain and safeguard information essential to our business as well as information relating to our customers, dealers, suppliers and employees. These systems are vulnerable to events beyond our reasonable control, including cyberattacks and security breaches, the need for system upgrades and support, telecommunication and internet failures, natural disasters and power loss. Such events could result in operational slowdowns, shutdowns or other difficulties; loss of revenues or market share; compromise or loss of sensitive or proprietary information; destruction or corruption of data; costs of remediation, upgrades, repair or recovery; breaches of obligations to third parties under privacy laws or contracts; or damage to our reputation or customer relationships; each of which, depending on the extent or duration of the event, could materially adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition. We maintain insurance coverage which may cover some of these risks, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, but such coverage may not be available or sufficient to cover all of the losses which may arise.\nWe may be adversely affected by security breaches, errors or disruptions relating to our software and software-as-a-service offerings.\nWe sell enterprise resource planning software and software-as-a-service offerings to our dealers. In connection with some of these offerings, we collect and store data belonging to our dealers, and we rely on third parties, such as cloud hosting providers and other service providers, to perform some of our obligations. If the security measures we and our third-party vendors use are breached, if there are errors in our software or if there are any service interruptions caused by other events, our offerings may not operate properly, dealer data could be lost or compromised, and our dealers\u2019 businesses may be disrupted. In such events, we may incur legal liabilities, lost business or harm to our brand reputation, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely impacted by losses and reputational damage related to product defects.\nProduct defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for product development and manufacturing activities. We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs, which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls.\nWe maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions. While we continue to make significant investments to improve product quality, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions. Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85796, "SIC": 2522, "TIC": "SCS"}
