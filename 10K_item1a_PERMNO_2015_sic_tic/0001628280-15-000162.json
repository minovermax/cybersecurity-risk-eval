The following risks could materially adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock. Other risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently do not recognize as material also could materially adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Economy and our Industry\nOur business is adversely affected by weak economic and other business conditions.\nThe global economy is unsettled with low or negative growth in Europe and emerging economies. Employment rates in the United States continued a slow recovery early in the year, although the recovery then accelerated particularly in the fourth quarter. In the past our business has not performed as well during periods of elevated unemployment and weak economic conditions, and our business has similarly struggled during the recent periods.\nDuring periods of elevated unemployment levels demand for contingent and permanent personnel decreases, which adversely impacts our Staffing Services segment. During slower economic activity, many of our customers reduce their use of contingent workers before undertaking layoffs of their own employees, resulting in decreased demand for contingent workers. Decreased demand and higher unemployment levels result in lower levels of pay rate increases and increased pressure on our markup of staffing service rates and direct margins and higher unemployment insurance costs. Since employees are also reluctant to risk changing employers, there are fewer openings available and, therefore, reduced activity in permanent placements. In recent years, many of our customers have significantly reduced their workforce, including their use of contingent labor.\nIn our business segments, we have experienced competition and pressure on price, margins and markups for renewals of customers\u2019 contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in our business segments without impacting revenue or margins. Additionally, our efforts to manage costs in relation to our business volumes may not be successful, and the timing of these efforts and associated earnings charges may adversely affect our business.\nCertain customers have also begun to contract for staffing services through managed service providers who assume all payment obligations on behalf of the end-customer to service suppliers such as Volt. These managed service providers may present greater credit risks than the end-customer and some of these managed service providers have in the past, and could in the future, default on their obligations to us, adversely impacting our business.\nThe contingent staffing industry is very competitive with few significant barriers to entry.\nThe markets for Volt\u2019s staffing services are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants frequently appear resulting in considerable market fragmentation. There are over 100 competitors with annual revenues over $300 million, some of whom are larger and have greater resources than we do. These competitors may be better able than we are to attract and retain qualified personnel, to offer more favorable pricing and terms, and otherwise attract and retain the business that we seek. In addition, some of the segment\u2019s customers, generally larger companies, are mandated or otherwise motivated to utilize the services of small or minority-owned companies rather than publicly held corporations such as Volt, and have redirected substantial amounts of their staffing business to those companies. We also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective customers may decide to provide similar services internally.\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of customers consolidating their staffing services purchases with a single provider or a small number of providers. This trend to consolidate purchases has, in some cases, made it more difficult for us to obtain or retain customers. Additionally, pricing pressures have intensified as customers have continued to competitively bid contracts. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will not encounter increased competition and lower margins in the future.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure and Finances\nOur ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit agreements.\nOur existing credit facilities include restrictive covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, change our lines of business and engage in certain consolidations, mergers, liquidations, or dissolutions. These covenants could limit our ability to react to market conditions or to otherwise engage in transactions beneficial to us.\nRisks Related to our Particular Customers and the Projects on which We Work\nOur project related businesses are subject to delays, unanticipated costs and cancellations that may result in unforeseen costs, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.\nIn some of our contracts we guarantee certain results of a project, such as the substantial completion of a project by a scheduled date, performance testing levels, results and other performance requirements. Failure to meet those criteria could result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, which could exceed our projected profit. Many projects involve extended time periods, sometimes over several years. We may encounter difficulties and delays, schedule changes, delays from our customers\u2019 failure to timely obtain rights required to perform or complete a project, weather-related delays and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could impact our ability to complete projects in accordance with the original delivery schedules. In addition, we often contract with subcontractors to assist us with our responsibilities, and any delay or poor performance by subcontractors may result in delays in the overall progress of projects or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. Delays and additional costs may be substantial, we may not be able to recover any or all of these costs and our revenues and operating profits could be significantly reduced. We also may be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns. Delays or cancellations also may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.\nAt times, project contracts may require customers or other parties to provide the specifications, design, equipment or materials to be used on a project. In some cases, the project schedule or the design, or equipment may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule. In addition, our customers may change or delay various elements of a project after commencement, resulting in additional direct or indirect costs.\nUnder these circumstances, we generally attempt to negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us. We may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, mediation, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for additional work or expense incurred by us due to customer change orders or failure by the customer to deliver items, such as specifications or materials on time. Litigation, arbitration or mediation of claims for compensation may be lengthy and costly, and may not ultimately result in us receiving adequate compensation for these matters, which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows. Delays or cancellations also may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.\nMany of our contracts either provide no minimum purchase requirements, are cancellable during the term, or both.\nIn our Staffing Services segment most contracts are not sole source, and many of our contracts, even those with multi-year terms, provide no assurance of any minimum amount of revenue. Under many of these contracts we still must compete for each individual placement or project. In addition, many of our long-term contracts contain cancellation provisions under which the customer can cancel the contract at any time or on relatively short notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Therefore, these contracts do not provide the assurances that typical long-term contracts often provide and are inherently uncertain with respect to the revenues and earnings we may recognize with respect to our customer contracts. Consequently, in all our business segments, if customers do not utilize our services under existing contracts or do not renew existing contracts, that could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business, including maintaining customer information. Failure to protect and maintain our data and information technology systems may cause outages or security breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, as well as our business reputation.\nOur business may be negatively affected if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology.\nWe must innovate and evolve our services and products to satisfy customer requirements and to remain competitive. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to foresee needed changes and to identify, develop and commercialize innovative and competitive services and products in a timely and cost effective manner and to achieve customer acceptance in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product and service introductions.\nThe loss of any key customers could adversely impact our business.\nAlthough we had no customer that represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal years 2014 or 2013, reductions, delays or cancellation of contracts with any of our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could materially reduce our revenue and operating income. There is no assurance that our current customers will continue to do business with us or that contracts with existing customers will continue at current or historical levels.\nWe are dependent upon the quality of our personnel.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management. In addition, we are dependent on the performance and productivity of our managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by customer relationships and the quality of service rendered. The loss of high quality personnel and members of management with significant experience in our industry without replacement by similar quality and experience may cause a significant disruption to our business. Moreover, the loss of key managers and field personnel could jeopardize existing customer relationships with businesses that use our services based upon relationships with those managers and field personnel.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain technologically qualified personnel.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain technologically qualified personnel, particularly for temporary assignments to customers of our Staffing Services segment, as well as in the areas of implementation and upgrading of internal systems. The availability of such personnel is dependent upon a number of economic and demographic conditions. We may in the future find it difficult or more costly to hire such personnel in the face of competition from other companies.\nIn addition variations in the rate of unemployment and higher wages sought by contingent workers in certain technical fields that continue to experience labor shortages could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands in these fields and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance and Litigation\nWe are subject to employment-related and other claims and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Staffing Services segment employs or engages individuals on a contingent basis and places them in a customer\u2019s workplace. Our ability to control the customer\u2019s workplace is limited, and we risk incurring liability to our employees for injury (which can result in increased workers\u2019 compensation costs) or other harm that they suffer at the customer\u2019s workplace. In addition we may face claims related to violations of wage and hour regulations, discrimination, harassment, the employment of undocumented or unlicensed personnel; misconduct, negligence or professional malpractice by our employees, and claims relating to the misclassification of independent contractors, among others.\nAdditionally, we risk liability to our customers for the actions or inactions of our employees, including those individuals employed on a contingent basis, that may result in harm to our customers. Such actions may be the result of negligence or misconduct on the part of our employees, damage to customer facilities due to negligence, criminal activity and other similar claims. In some cases, we must indemnify our customers for certain acts of our employees, and certain customers have negotiated increases in the scope of such indemnification agreements. We also may incur fines, penalties and losses that are not covered by insurance or negative publicity with respect to these matters. There can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have in place will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks.\nInsurance has limits and exclusions and we retain risk.\nOur insurance policies for various exposures including, but not limited to, general liability, auto liability, workers compensation and employer\u2019s liability, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, professional liability, employment practices, loss to real and personal property, business interruption, fiduciary and other management liability, are limited and the losses that we face may be not be covered, may be subject to high deductibles or may exceed the limits purchased.\nCosts related to litigation could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe are involved in pending and threatened legal proceedings from time to time, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. It is uncertain at what point any of these or new matters may affect us, and there can be no assurance that our financial resources are sufficient to cover these matters in their entirety or any one of these matters. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these matters will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nImproper disclosure of sensitive or confidential employee or customer data, including personal data, could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nOur business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our full-time and contingent workers, customers and other individuals. This information may contain sensitive or confidential employee and customer data, including personal data. Additionally, our employees may have access or exposure to customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. We and our third party service providers have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. It is possible that our security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third party service providers follow may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of such\ninformation. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nThe possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nNew and increased government regulation, employment costs or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially for our contingent staffing business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to licensing and regulation in some states and most foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with these requirements, or that the cost of compliance will not become material. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we do or intend to do business may:\n\u2022\ncreate new or additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of services that we currently provide;\n\u2022\nimpose new or additional employment costs that we may not be able to be pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services, especially in our Staffing Services segment, which could adversely impact our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to obtain additional licenses; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes (especially payroll and other employment-related taxes) or enact new or different taxes payable by the providers or users of services such as those offered by us, thereby increasing our costs, some of which we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services especially in our Staffing Services segment, which could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn some of our foreign markets, new and proposed regulatory activity is imposing additional requirements and costs, and could cause changes in customers\u2019 attitudes regarding the use of outsourcing and contingent workers in general, which could have an adverse effect on our contingent staffing business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could be volatile and, as a result, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them.\nOur stock price has in the past, and could in the future, fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the expectations of the investment community or our estimates of our future results of operations;\n\u2022\nindustry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of one or more key customers;\n\u2022\nstrategic moves by our competitors, such as product or service announcements or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock market has experienced, and is likely to in the future experience, volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur principal shareholders own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over Volt. Their interests may differ from those of other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our principal shareholders, who are related family members, controlled approximately 40% of our outstanding common stock. Although there can be no assurance as to how these shareholders will vote, these shareholders, if they vote in the same manner, would effectively be able to control the composition of our board of directors and many other matters requiring shareholder approval and would continue to have significant influence over our affairs. The interests of our principal shareholders may not align with those of our other shareholders.\nFurthermore, the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law, to which we are subject, require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of all of our outstanding shares entitled to vote in order to adopt a plan of merger or consolidation between us and another entity and to approve a sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets not made in our usual and regular course of business. Accordingly, our principal shareholders, acting together, could prevent the approval of such transactions even if such transactions are in the best interests of our other shareholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, and such proxy contest could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of the Company\u2019s securities.\nOn December 9, 2014, Glacier Peak Capital and its affiliates submitted a notice of its intention to nominate four director candidates for election to the Board at our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. If Glacier Peak does not withdraw its nominations and we are unable to reach an agreement with Glacier Peak relating to our 2015 annual meeting, a proxy contest is likely to occur. It is possible that Glacier-nominated directors could constitute half of the Board following our 2015 annual meeting.\nA proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. In addition, if Glacier Peak\u2019s nominees were to constitute half of the Board following our 2015 annual meeting, because any action by the Board requires the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the directors present and voting, it is possible that the Board would deadlock on certain issues. The potential of a proxy contest could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key business partners, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above or a threat of future stockholder activism.\nNew York law and our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain provisions that could make the takeover of Volt more difficult.\nCertain provisions of New York law and our articles of incorporation and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring Volt, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with directors having staggered, two-year terms;\n\u2022\npermitting removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees.\nIn addition to the voting power of our principal shareholders discussed above, our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with a potential acquirer that it did not believe was in our strategic interests. If an acquirer is discouraged from offering to acquire Volt or prevented from successfully completing an acquisition by these or other measures, our shareholders could lose the opportunity to sell their shares at a more favorable price.", "PERMNO": 81190, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "VOLT"}
