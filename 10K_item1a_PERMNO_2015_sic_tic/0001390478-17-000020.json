{"cik": "1390478", "company": "Galena Biopharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in this annual report or our other public statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Former Commercial Operations\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations, and we recently have been subpoenaed in connection with marketing and promotional practices related to Abstral\u00ae (fentanyl) sublingual tablets. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such prosecutions or related litigation under these laws. If we have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur former commercial operations and development programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal False Claims Act, federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and the federal Sunshine Act. A federal investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Alabama (SDAL) of two of the high-prescribing physicians for Abstral has resulted in the criminal prosecution of the two physicians for alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and other federal statutes. On April 28, 2016, a second superseding indictment was filed in the criminal case, which added additional information about the defendant physicians and provided information regarding the facts and circumstances involving a rebate agreement between the Company and the defendant physicians\u2019 pharmacy as well as their ownership of our stock. The criminal trial, which began on January 4, 2017, concluded with a jury verdict on February 23, 2017 finding these physicians guilty on 19 of 20 counts; sentencing is scheduled for May 2017. At the end of the SDAL case, SDAL dismissed count 18 of the indictment charging that the physicians conspired, through the C&R Pharmacy, to receive illegal kickbacks in exchange for prescribing Abstral. Though certain former employees received trial subpoenas to appear at the trial and provide oral testimony, only one former employee testified at the trial. We agreed to reimburse those former employees\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. To our knowledge, we were not a target or subject of that investigation.\nThere have also been federal and state investigations of a company that has a product that competes with Abstral in the same therapeutic class, and we have learned that the FDA and other governmental agencies are investigating our Abstral promotion practices. On December 16, 2015, we received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey requesting the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to our marketing and promotional practices for Abstral. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and are cooperating in the production of the requested documents. We have come to understand that the investigation being undertaken by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and Department of Justice is a criminal investigation in addition to a civil investigation that could ultimately involve the company as well as one or more former employees. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s charter, we are currently reimbursing any former employees\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees with respect to the investigation. We are cooperating with the civil and criminal investigation and through our outside counsel we have recently begun preliminary discussions with the government aimed at the ultimate resolution of the investigation regarding the Company.\nWe may be subject to legal or administrative actions as a result of these matters, or the impact of such matters. If we are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or any other applicable state or any federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, such as civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs. We can make no assurances as to the time or resources that will need to be devoted to these matters or their outcome, or the impact, if any, that these matters or any resulting legal or administrative proceedings may have on our business or financial condition.\nMany of the regulatory provisions that we are subject to include criminal provisions. If we are unable to comply with these provisions in the operation of our business we may become subject to civil and criminal investigations and proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Qui tam suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201crelators\u201d or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend such qui tam actions and pay substantial sums to settle such actions. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. An alleged violation of the Anti- Kickback Statute may be used as a predicate offense to establish liability pursuant to other federal laws and regulations such as the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions expanding the ability of certain relators to bring actions that would have been dismissed under prior law. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact or modify their state false claims acts to be at least as effective as the federal False Claims Act by granting states a portion of any federal Medicaid funds recovered through Medicaid-related actions. Most states have enacted state false claims laws, and many of those states included laws including qui tam provisions. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosures. Manufacturers must also disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per year for knowing violations and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the U.S., and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont imposed an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. These laws could affect our product promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we could have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our system. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans also will impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us.\nWe face product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe commercial sale of our products after they are approved as well as the use of our products in clinical trials exposes us to possible product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA, if our products were sold to third parties, or if our products are provided in clinical trials. Our products are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products could result in injury to a patient or even death. For example, because the placebo may have performed better than NeuVax in the PRESENT Trial, the use of NeuVax may have worsened the patient\u2019s condition.\nProduct liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or generic versions of our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. Because we have sold Abstral and Zuplenz\u00ae (ondansetron) oral soluble film and provided NeuVax as a study drug in the PRESENT Trial and other clinical trials, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business; or\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for commercial product sales with a $10 million per occurrence and a $10 million annual aggregate coverage limit. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage based on sales of our products, we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects, including side effects that may be less severe than those of our products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers and suppliers activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials even after we sell or otherwise dispose of the products. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use will be stored at our contractors or manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause injury to our employees and others, environmental damage resulting in costly cleanup and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we expect that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party contractors and manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials will generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination.\nWe will continue to be responsible for certain liabilities and obligations related to Abstral and Zuplenz, and if unknown liabilities were to arise it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder our respective asset purchase agreements with Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. and Midatech Pharma PLC, our future obligations under our former agreements with Orexo AB and MonoSol Rx have been assumed by Sentynl and Midatech, respectively, except that we will continue to be responsible for chargebacks, rebates, patient assistance and certain other product distribution channel liabilities related to Abstral and Zuplenz for a specified period of time post-closing. We also will be responsible for any pre-closing liabilities and obligations related to Abstral and Zuplenz, including unknown liabilities, and have agreed in the respective asset purchase agreements to indemnify Sentynl and Midatech for any breach of our representations, warranties and covenants in the respective asset purchase agreements up to a certain agreed to amount. We cannot quantify these responsibilities to Sentanyl and Midatech, but if substantial unknown liabilities were to arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Development Programs\nOur drug candidates may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nBefore they can be marketed, our products in development must be approved by the FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies. The process for obtaining FDA approval is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Although our drug candidates have exhibited no serious adverse events (\u201cSAEs\u201d) in the Phase 1 and 1/2 clinical trial, SAEs or other unexpected side effects may arising during further testing and development, and A failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these products may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. It also is possible to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials.\nOur Phase 3 PRESENT clinical trial has been stopped due to futility and though we have conducted an investigation of the causes for the failure of the clinical trial, we are not certain that the investigation has identified the reason(s) for the failure.\nOn June 27, 2016, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee conducting the pre-planned interim analysis of the PRESENT Trial recommended that we stop the clinical trial because of futility. We have conducted an investigation of the causes of the failure of the trial. As a result, our observations are that a phenomenon known as pseudoprogression likely had a meaningful impact on the events assessed as NeuVax recurrences in the trial. The purpose of the NeuVax vaccine is to generate a HER2 directed T cell-based immune response targeting those undetected micrometastases and eradicate them before they grow into a clinically detectable tumor. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon that occurs when radiographic scans in patients responding to treatment with immunotherapy give the appearance of progression due to increased tumor size or swelling from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, and other immune cells. In simple terms, the cancer looks like it has progressed on radiographic images, but in reality, the immunotherapy has done its job to create an immune response via inflammation around a micrometastasis. Therefore, a growing tumor or a new tumor detected via imaging isn\u2019t always progressing cancer and may simply represent an immune system response to an undetectable micrometastasis that would not otherwise be seen on the scan. In the trial, we believe that the low rate of recurrences in the control arm resulted from an overall improvement in the standard of care. In addition, proactive imaging led to the discovery of lesions, some of which may not have had any clinical significance at the time of identification. Finally, the inflammation caused by TILs within the micrometastases and more specifically the NeuVax-induced cytotoxic T-cells, made them visible on scans in the NeuVax group and not in the control group. We now believe that causing this inflammation may have identified lesions via proactive scanning that may have never progressed to a clinical tumor. Because patients were discontinued from this study at the time they were identified as having DFS event, we do not know if some of these patients who were diagnosed with a recurrence on the CT scan would have progressed to have metastatic cancer. In summary, though we are applying the knowledge and observations to our other immunotherapy programs, we may not have identified the reason(s) for the failure of the clinical trial.\nOur products, GALE-301 and GALE-302 have the same mechanism of action as NeuVax and may not be a viable product to prevent the recurrence of ovarian cancer or other types of cancers.\nGALE-301 and GALE-302, which have a similar mechanism of action as NeuVax, may no longer be a viable product to prevent the recurrence of ovarian cancer or other types of cancer, depending upon the reasons for the causes of the failure of NeuVax.\nA number of different factors could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board or \u201cIDSMB\u201d governing our clinical trials, or an institutional review board, or \u201cIRB,\u201d which is an independent committee registered with and overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or \u201cHHS,\u201d that functions to approve, monitor and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans, may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time for various reasons, including if we or it believe the subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a drug candidate on subjects or patients in a clinical trial could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspending or terminating the trial and refusing to approve a particular drug candidate for any or all indications of use.\nClinical trials of a new drug candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the drug candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors, and delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times than we expect at present. Patients who are enrolled at the outset of this standard of care also may eventually choose for personal reasons not to participate in the study. We also compete for eligible patients with other clinical trials underway from time to time, and we may experience delays in patient enrollment due to the dependency of other large trials underway in the same patient population.\nClinical trials also require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually review clinical investigations to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval.\nIn addition, cancer vaccines are a relatively new form of therapeutic treatment and a very limited number of such products have received regulatory approval. Therefore, the FDA or other regulatory authority may apply standards for approval of a new cancer vaccine that is different from past experience.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our drug development efforts, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in enrolling patients in our planned clinical trials in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in arranging for third parties to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nproblems in engaging IRBs to oversee trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB approval of studies;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour drug candidates having very different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than in laboratory testing and interacting with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways, and the possibility that our previous Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials will not be indicative of our drug candidates\u2019 performance in larger patient populations;\n\u2022\nthe need to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\ninsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our drug candidates or other necessary materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndisruption at our clinical trial sites resulting from local social or political unrest or other geopolitical factors;\n\u2022\neffects of our drug candidates not having the desired effects or including undesirable side effects or the drug candidates having other unexpected characteristics;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for drug candidates similar to our own or inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u2022\nadverse results obtained by other companies developing similar drugs;\n\u2022\nmodification of the drug during testing;\n\u2022\nour capital resources; and\n\u2022\nreallocation of our financial and other resources to other clinical programs.\nIt is possible that none of the product candidates that we develop will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them or that any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate.\nIn addition, the length of time to develop the product candidates as well as any regulatory delays in the development and regulatory approval process could cause the patent exclusivity to be unavailable or greatly reduced for each product candidate. The lack of patent exclusivity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside of the U.S.\nWe are dependent upon contract manufacturers for clinical supplies of our product candidates.\nWe do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture supplies of any of our product candidates for clinical trials. Accordingly, we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for these supplies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure needed supply arrangements on reasonable terms, or at all. Our failure to secure these arrangements as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates or, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, to commercialize them.\nOur current plans call for the manufacture of our compounds by contract manufacturers offering research grade, Good Laboratory Practices grade and Good Manufacturing Practices grade materials for preclinical studies (e.g., toxicology studies) and for clinical use. Certain of our product candidates are complex molecules requiring many synthesis steps, which may lead to challenges with purification and scale-up. These challenges could result in increased costs and delays in manufacturing. For GALE-401, we will change contract manufacturers for the supply of the clinical study drug and the commercial product, which may lead to delays in the initiation and completion of the Phase 3 trial and filing for regulatory approval.\nIn the clinical trials using NeuVax, Leukine is also administered and its availability is dependent upon a third-party manufacturer, which may or may not reliably provide Leukine, thus jeopardizing the completion of the trials.\nNeuVax is administered in combination with Leukine, a \u201cGM-CSF\u201d available in both liquid and lyopholyzed forms exclusively from Genzyme Corporation, or \u201cGenzyme,\u201d a subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis. We will continue to be dependent on Genzyme for our supply of Leukine in connection with the ongoing NeuVax and GALE-301/GALE-302 trials and the potential commercial manufacture of these programs. Any temporary interruptions or discontinuation of the availability of Leukine, or any determination by us to change the GM-CSF used with NeuVax or GALE-301/GALE-302, may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials and any commercialization of the assets.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop or potentially commercialize some or all of our product candidates.\nWe expect to depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to manufacture our product candidates, and to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for or maintain relationships with collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, vendors and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to successfully negotiate such agreements will depend on, among other things, potential partners\u2019 evaluation of the superiority of our technology over competing technologies and the quality of the preclinical and clinical data that we have generated, and the perceived risks specific to developing our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates. Under certain license agreements that we have already entered into, we have minimum dollar amounts per year that we are obligated to spend on the development of the technology we have licensed from our contract partners and other obligations to maintain certain licenses. If we fail to meet this requirement under any of our licenses that contain such requirements or any other obligations under these licenses, we may be in breach of our obligations under such agreement, which may result in the loss of the technology licensed. We cannot necessarily control the amount or timing of resources that our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill its obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion. We may not be able to readily terminate any such agreements with contract partners even if such contract partners do not fulfill its obligations to us.\nIn addition, we may receive notices from third parties from time to time alleging that our technology or product candidates infringe upon the intellectual property rights of those third parties. Any assertion by third parties that our activities or product candidates infringe upon its intellectual property rights may adversely affect our ability to secure strategic partners or licensees for our technology or product candidates or our ability to secure or maintain manufacturers for our compounds.\nWe are subject to competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe biotechnology industry, including the cancer immunotherapy market, is intensely competitive and involves a high degree of risk. We compete with other companies that have far greater experience and financial, research and technical resources than us. Potential competitors in the U.S. and worldwide are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations, many of which have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staffs and facilities than us. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete directly with those incorporating our technology, introduce products to market earlier than our products or on a more cost effective basis. In addition, our technology may be subject to competition from other technology or methods developed using techniques other than those developed by traditional biotechnology methods. Our competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our technology. We and our collaborators may face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to various modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price and patent position, including the potentially dominant patent positions of others. An inability to successfully complete our product development could lead to us having limited prospects for establishing market share or generating revenue from our technology.\nGALE-401 must successfully complete a Phase 3 clinical trial and obtain regulatory approval before we can market the product and our competitors may obtain a successful clinical trial result and regulatory approval before we do.\nGALE-401 contains the active ingredient, anagrelide, an FDA-approved product, for the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to lower abnormally elevated platelet levels. The currently available immediate release (IR) version of anagrelide causes adverse events that are believed to be dose and plasma concentration dependent. These adverse events may limit the use of the IR version of the drug. Therefore, reducing the maximum concentration (Cmax) is hypothesized to reduce the side effects, while preserving efficacy, potentially allowing a broader use of the drug. We have analyzed our data and the treatment landscape for MPNs, with a current focus on Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) where we see an unmet medical need in patients who are intolerant to the current standard of care. We may be advancing GALE-401 into a pivotal trial. The risks include but are not limited to regulatory (agreement with regulatory agency on the development plan), operational (rate of enrollment), and statistical confirmation of the safety and efficacy endpoints. In addition, there are other potential competitors whose clinical trials may be successful and obtain regulatory approval prior to our regulatory approval, if our pivotal trial is successful.\nWe are dependent on technologies we license, and if we lose the right to license such technologies or we fail to license new technologies in the future, our ability to develop new products would be harmed.\nWe currently are dependent on licenses from third parties for technologies relating to our product candidates. Our current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, funding, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance and other obligations on us. If our license with respect to any of these technologies is terminated for any reason, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses would be delayed, or suspended altogether, while we seek to license similar technology or develop new non-infringing technology. The costs of obtaining new licenses are high.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development.\nWe may conduct future studies in countries outside of the United States. Consequently, we may be subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance\nwith tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are conducting a review of strategic alternatives for the Company, including evaluating potential paths forward for NeuVax, GALE 301/302 and GALE 401 that could significantly impact our future operations and financial position.\nIn January 2017, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, our board of directors is reviewing alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that we may explore and evaluate during the ongoing review process include, among others, a sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company. Pending any decision to change strategic direction, we have limited our research and development activities to manage our cash position. We cannot provide any commitment as to the timing of our determination or the strategy we may adopt. If we determine to change our business strategy or to seek to engage in a strategic transaction, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. If we determine to further develop NeuVax, GALE 301/302 and GALE 401, or all of the products, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change in our business strategy and future funding requirements.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing, and may not be able to develop our product candidates.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $29.1 million as of February 28, 2017. We had no revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, and our cash burn from operations for the quarter ending December 31, 2016 was approximately $8.0 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements. This projection is based on our current limited planned operations, anticipated payments for defense costs for the governmental investigation, and estimates of potential resolution of the SEC investigation, and is also subject to changes in our operating plans, resolution of and unanticipated developments in the ongoing government investigation and other legal matters and uncertainties inherent in our business. We may need to seek to replenish our existing cash and cash equivalents prior over the next year.\nIn addition, we have approximately $13.7 million of restricted cash as of February 28, 2017. We negotiated an amendment with the holder of the debt that reduces the restricted cash amount to the lesser of $18.5 million or the outstanding balance of the amended debenture under certain conditions. We also have limited funding available under our amended purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC and sales agreements with FBR & Co. and Maxim Group LLC. There is no guarantee that such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or will be sufficient to meet all of our future funding needs.\nAt our annual meeting of stockholders adjourned on July 15, 2016, our stockholders approved an increase in our authorized common stock from 275,000,000 to 350,000,000. In addition, our shareholders authorized the Board of Directors to approve a reverse stock split within twelve months of October 21, 2016 at a ratio between 1:2 and 1:20. There was no reduction in the amount of authorized shares. The Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1:20, effective on November 11, 2016. We are not able to predict whether volume of shares post reverse stock split will be sufficient based upon the reverse stock split price to meet the Company\u2019s ongoing financing requirements to maintain the Company\u2019s operations.\nIf we fail to obtain additional future funding when needed, we could be forced to scale back or terminate our operations, or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company. We may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due, raising substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our common stock holders losing their entire investment. There is no guaranty that we will become profitable or secure additional financing.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating and non-operating expenses, which may make it difficult for us to secure sufficient financing, and may lead to uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSubstantial funds were expended to develop our technologies and product candidates, and additional substantial funds will be required for further preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale. Because the successful development of our products is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate enough revenue, even if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable.\nIn the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing if needed or if we incur significant expense related to the resolution of the ongoing government investigation, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due, that in turn may raise substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our common stock holders losing their entire investment. There is no guaranty that we will secure additional financing if we need such financing. Our financial statements contemplate that we will continue as a going concern and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern. Changes in our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, defense costs related to the recent securities lawsuits, resolution of the ongoing government investigation, the acceleration or modification of our expansion plans, increased expenses, potential acquisitions or other events may affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Future financing may be obtained through, and future development efforts may be paid for by, the issuance of debt or equity, which may have an adverse effect on our security holders or may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation. In such event, there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled, there may be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of common stock. In addition, if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, whether through private placements or additional public offerings, such an issuance would dilute your ownership in us.\nThe terms of debt securities may also impose restrictions on our operations, which may include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock, or to make certain acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios, and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control.\nYou may have difficulty evaluating our business, and our historical financial information may not be representative of our future results.\nWe have closed our PRESENT trial due to futility, are evaluating the appropriate time to commence the GALE-401 trial and anticipate making a definitive determination in the second half of 2017, and plan to continue to support the investigator-sponsored immunotherapy trials. As a result, we will have no recurring revenues unless and until we are able to obtain marketing approval of one or more of our other product candidates and our historical financial information may not be representative of our future results.\nWe may be unable to comply with our reporting and other requirements under federal securities laws.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act.\u201d In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. From time to time we evaluate our existing internal controls in light of the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It is possible that we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure or difficulties in implementing and maintaining these controls could cause us to fail to meet the periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management and independent auditor assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to obtain and enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success with respect to our product candidates will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and abroad, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our patents and patent applications, however, may not be sufficient to provide protection for NeuVax or our other products and product candidates against commercial competition.\nThe active peptide found in NeuVax, the E75 peptide, has been known and studied for many years. We have one issued U.S. patent, US 6,514,942, covering the composition of matter of the E75 peptide, which expired in mid-2015, prior to any potential commercialization of NeuVax. We do not have and will not be able to obtain any composition of matter patent protection for E75, the active peptide in NeuVax. We also have a license from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation to issued U.S., European, Japanese, Korean, Mexican and Australian method of use patents, which expire in 2028, that are directed to a method of inducing immunity against breast cancer recurrence by administering a composition comprising the E75 peptide to patients who have both an immunohistochemistry (IHC) rating of 1+ or 2+ for HER2/neu protein expression, as well as a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) rating of less than about 2.0 for HER2/neu gene expression. The license further includes an issued U.S. method of use patent directed to a method of inducing immunity against recurrence of any HER2/neu expressing tumors by administering the E75 peptide to patients with tumors having a FISH rating of less than about 2.0 for HER2/neu gene expression; an allowed U.S application which includes claims to the use of E75 to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, including bone only recurrence; and pending applications with similar claims in a number of foreign jurisdiction, all of which expire in 2028. Also included in the license is a method of use patent, which expires in 2026, that is directed to the use of NeuVax in combination with Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab) to treat any HER2/neu expressing cancer. Thus, our method of use patents may not prevent competitors from seeking to develop and market NeuVax for use in cancer patients who do not meet these criteria. If any such alternative uses were approved, this could lead to off-label use and price erosion for our NeuVax product. We may seek FDA approval for use of NeuVax to treat cancer patients who fall outside the claimed IHC and FISH ranges and for other cancers as well. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for NeuVax through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nAnagrelide hydrochloride, the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient, or \u201cAPI,\u201d in GALE-401, has been approved for many years and, thus, it is not possible to obtain composition of matter patents that cover anagrelide hydrochloride. As a result, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same 43 API as GALE-401, so long as the competitors do not infringe any formulation patents that we may have or may obtain or license, if any. The only patent protection that we have or are likely to obtain covering GALE-401 are patents relating to specific formulations, methods using these formulations, and methods of manufacturing and packaging. We have an issued U.S. Patent, which expires in 2020, covering methods of using anagrelide to reduce platelet count in patients subject to veno-occlusive events. We have granted patents in the U.S., United Kingdom and Japan, which expire in 2029, covering controlled release formulations of anagrelide and methods of use. We also are prosecuting pending patent applications in other territories including, but not limited to, the U.S., Europe, India, and Japan, which may not issue prior to any potential commercialization of GALE-401. We may seek FDA approval for use of GALE-401 to treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms that include several hematological disorders, including essential thrombocythemia. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for GALE-401 through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nThe active peptides found in GALE-301 and GALE-302 are derived from Folate Binding Protein. One of the active peptides, E39, has been known and studied for many years. The other active peptide, GALE-302, is a derivative of E39. We have a license from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation to issued and granted patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan, covering composition of matter for the E39 derivative peptides, including GALE-302, alone and in combination with E39, as well as the use of these compositions for the treatment of cancer. These patents are expected to expire in 2022, prior to any potential commercialization of GALE-301. We do not have and will not be able to obtain any composition of matter patent protection for the E39 peptide in any territory. The license we have from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation grants us the right to develop and market GALE-301 for any use, including methods of treating cancer. Our patents may not prevent competitors from seeking to develop and market the E39 peptide alone. If any such alternative uses of compositions containing the E39 peptide were approved, this could lead to off label use and price erosion for GALE-301. We may seek FDA approval for use of GALE-301, alone or in combination with GALE-302, to treat cancer patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers and for other cancers, as well. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for GALE-301 and the combination of GALE-301 and GALE-302 through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nOur ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, rights under any patents we have or may obtain or license may not provide us with sufficient protection for our commercial product and product candidates to afford a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded and generic pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Nor can we guarantee that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. or abroad may diminish the value of our intellectual property. In addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular the first-to-file provision and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement of or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.\nWhile we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we may not be able to detect infringement of our own or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for methods of manufacturing or formulation products, and we depend, in part, on our licensors and collaborators to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may challenge our in-licensed patents and any of our own patents that we may obtain, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights is very complex, expensive, and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely affect our ability to prevent third parties from competing with us.\nIf another party has reason to assert a substantial new question of patentability against any of our claims in our own and in-licensed patents, the third party can request that the patent claims be reexamined, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. In addition to potential infringement suits and, interference and reexamination proceedings, we may become a party to patent opposition proceedings where either the patentability of the inventions subject of our patents are challenged, or we are challenging the patents of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful. As the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert our commercial product and/or product candidates infringe their patent rights. If a third-party\u2019s patents were found to cover our commercial product and product candidates, proprietary technologies or its uses, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to continue to commercialize our products or use our proprietary technologies unless we or it obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us or our collaborators on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our commercial product and product candidates pending a trial on the merits, which could be years away.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers. As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, certain of our employees were formerly employed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Moreover, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our commercial product and product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees and consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these types of claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, any such litigation would likely be protracted, expensive, a distraction to our management team, not viewed favorably by investors and other third parties, and may potentially result in an unfavorable outcome.\nOur product candidates may face competition sooner than expected after the expiration of our composition of matter patent protection for such products.\nOur composition of matter patents for many of our product candidates have expired or will expire prior to any product approval. We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our NeuVax as well as our GALE-301 and GALE-302 product candidates provided under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and similar laws in other countries. We believe that these product candidates will qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA) enacted in March 2010. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological product candidates. There is also a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf our product candidates are not considered biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA, they may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.\nEven if, as we expect, NeuVax, GALE-301 and GALE-302 are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products.\nIn some countries outside of the U.S., peptide vaccines, such as NeuVax, GALE-301 and GALE-302, are regulated as chemical drugs rather than as biologics and may or may not be eligible for non-patent exclusivity.\nAlthough we have received orphan drug designation for both GALE-301, as well as GALE-301 and GALE-302, there is no guarantee that the drugs will be successfully approved by the FDA, that they will be commercially successful in the marketplace, or that another drug will not be approved for the same indication ahead of our drugs.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property). We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage and market manipulation) and expertise. While we have invested significantly in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they use to trade in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock trades at prices less than $1.00 which is the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards, as such our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThe continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market require that the closing bid price of our common stock not be less than $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days. On March 14, 2017 the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market was $0.55 per share and has been below the $1.00 closing bid price since February 8, 2017. If our trading price falls below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days or more, we may receive a notice from NASDAQ informing us that we may be delisted unless our trading price is above $1.00 for more than 10 consecutive trading days. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we would have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. We can regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid listing requirement if the closing bid price is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during this initial 180-day compliance period. If compliance is not achieved within the 180-day period, NASDAQ would provide written notification to us that our common stock is subject to delisting. In the event that we fail to regain compliance with NASDAQ continued listing standards by the expiration of the applicable cure period or any extension period, NASDAQ will commence suspension and delisting procedures with respect to our common stock, which could impair the value of your investment.\nOn January 18, 2017, we received an inquiry from NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department seeking information in connection with the subpoenas issued to the Company by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Alabama. We responded to the inquiry on February 1, 2017. If we are not in compliance with the listing requirements under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5502(a)(2), we could be delisted by NASDAQ.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market in the future, such securities may be traded over-the-counter on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d Such alternative market, however, is generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, NASDAQ. Accordingly, delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ could have a significant negative effect on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all and could reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has exhibited substantial volatility recently. Between January 1, 2016 and February 28, 2017, the sale price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market ranged from a low of $0.62 to a high of $49.80 as adjusted for the reverse stock split effected in November 2016. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following factors:\n\u2022\nreports of the results of our clinical trials regarding the safety or efficacy of our product candidates and surrogate markers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory developments or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of business or strategic transactions or our success in finalizing such a transaction;\n\u2022\nannouncements of legal or regulatory actions against us or any adverse outcome of any such actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationship with our licensors, licensees and other strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other technology ownership rights;\n\u2022\nadditional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of drug pricing; and\n\u2022\ngeneral changes in the economy, the financial markets or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries.\nFactors beyond our control may also have an impact on the price of our stock. For example, to the extent that other companies within our industry experience declines in their stock prices, our stock price may decline as well.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal or administrative actions that could adversely affect our financial condition and our business.\nOn December 22, 2016, Galena Biopharma, Inc. and its former CEO reached an agreement in principle to a proposed settlement that would resolve an investigation by the staff of the SEC involving conduct in the period 2012-2014 regarding the commissioning of internet publications by outside promotional firms. Under the terms of the proposed settlement framework, Galena and the former CEO would consent to the entry of an administrative order requiring that we and the former CEO cease and desist from any future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), 17(a), and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and various rules thereunder, without admitting or denying the findings in the order. Based upon the proposed settlement framework, the Company will make a $200,000 penalty payment. In addition to other remedies, the proposed settlement framework would require the former CEO to make a disgorgement and prejudgment interest payment as well as a penalty payment to the Commission. To address the issues raised by the SEC staff\u2019s investigation, in addition to previous governance enhancements we have implemented, we have voluntarily undertaken to implement a number of remedial actions relating to securities offerings and our interactions with investor relations and public relations firms. The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the Commission and would acknowledge our cooperation in the investigation and confirm our voluntary undertaking to continue that cooperation. If the Commission does not approve the settlement, we may need to enter into further discussions with the SEC staff to resolve the investigated matters on different terms and conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the final terms of any resolution including its financial impact or any future adjustment to the financial statements. A special committee of the Board of Directors has determined in response to an indemnification claim by the former CEO that we are required under Delaware law to indemnify our former CEO for the disgorgement and prejudgment interest payment of approximately $750,000 that he would be required to pay if and when the settlement is approved by the Commission. Any penalty payment that the former CEO will be required to make in connection with this matter ($600,000 under the proposed settlement framework) will be the responsibility of the former CEO. In the event the Commission does approve the proposed settlement, the Company may not have available certain exemptions and safe harbor protections under the securities laws.\nOn February 13, 2017, a putative shareholder securities class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entitled, Miller v. Galena Biopharma, Inc., et al. On February 15, 2017, a putative shareholder securities class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entitled, Kattuah v Galena Biopharma, Inc., et al. Within the time allowed under the federal rules and statutes, the Company and the other defendants, former and current officers, will respond to the complaints through an appropriate pleading or motion.\nA federal investigation of two of the high-prescribing physicians for Abstral (former commercial product) has resulted in the criminal prosecution of the two physicians for alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and other federal statutes. The criminal trial began in January 2017 and is ongoing. We have received a trial subpoena for documents in connection with that investigation and we have been in contact with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Alabama, which is handling the criminal trial, and are cooperating in the production of documents. On April 28, 2016, a second superseding indictment was filed in the criminal case, which added additional information about the defendant physicians and provided information regarding the facts and circumstances involving a rebate agreement between the Company and the defendant physicians\u2019 pharmacy as well as their ownership of our stock. The criminal trial, which began on January 4, 2017, concluded with a jury verdict on February 23, 2017 finding these physicians guilty on 19 of 20 counts; sentencing is scheduled for May 2017. At the end of the SDAL case, SDAL dismissed count 18 of the indictment charging that the physicians conspired, through the C&R Pharmacy, to receive illegal kickbacks in exchange for prescribing Abstral. Though certain former employees received trial subpoenas to appear at the trial and provide oral testimony, only one former employee testified at the trial. We agreed to reimburse those former employees\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. To our knowledge, we were not a target or subject of that investigation.\nThere also have been federal and state investigations of a company that has a product that competes with Abstral in the same therapeutic class, and we have learned that the FDA and other governmental agencies are investigating our Abstral promotion practices. On December 16, 2015, we received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey requesting the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to our marketing and promotional practices for Abstral. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and are cooperating in the production of the requested documents. We have come to understand that the investigation being undertaken by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and Department of Justice is a criminal investigation in addition to a civil investigation that could ultimately involve the company as well as one or more former employees. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s charter, we are currently reimbursing any former employees\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees with respect to the investigation. We are cooperating with the civil and criminal investigation and through our outside counsel we have recently begun preliminary discussions with the government aimed at the ultimate resolution of the investigation regarding the Company.\nWe may be subject to legal or administrative actions as a result of these matters, or the impact of such matters. If we are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or any other applicable state or any federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, such as civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs. We can make no assurances as to the time or resources that will need to be devoted to these matters or their outcome, or the impact, if any, that these matters or any resulting legal or administrative proceedings may have on our business or financial condition.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial unreimbursed legal fees and other expenses in connection with these or other legal and regulatory proceedings that may not qualify for coverage under, or may exceed the limits of, our applicable directors and officers liability insurance policies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. These matters also may distract the time and attention of our officers and directors or divert our other resources away from our ongoing development programs. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could damage our business and reputation or result in additional claims or proceedings against us.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales in the public market of shares of our common stock, including shares referred to in the foregoing risk factors or shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding stock options, or the perception by the market that these sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had reserved for issuance 560,925 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $41.50 per share and 2,569,751 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $29.12 per share. Upon exercise of these options and warrants, the underlying shares may be resold into the public market. In the case of outstanding options and warrants that have exercise prices that are below the market price of our common stock from time to time, our stockholders would experience dilution upon the exercise of these options.\nOur outstanding warrants may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur outstanding April 2011 warrants to purchase a total of 12,900 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2016 at a current exercise price of $1.00 per share contain so-called full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. Our outstanding December 2012 warrants to purchase 151,565 shares of common stock as of December 2016 with a current exercise price of $10.32 per share contain so-called weighted-average anti-dilution provisions. These anti-dilution provisions may be triggered by the issuance of the shares being offered hereby or upon any future issuance by us of shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share below the then-exercise price of the warrants, subject to some exceptions. The share and per share amounts described above are presented on a post-split basis that was effected November 11, 2016.\nTo the extent that these anti-dilution provisions are triggered in the future, we would be required to reduce the exercise price of all of the warrants on either a full-ratchet or weighted-average basis, which would have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect stockholder rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management and may be constrained by other contractual agreements with third parties. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes, with members of each class to be elected for staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of security holders to remove directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u2022\nregulate how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation such as our company shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate crosses the 15% stock ownership threshold. Section 203 could operate to delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings in the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and are prohibited by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness from paying dividends on any common stock, except with the prior consent of our lenders. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe terms of our outstanding indebtedness may inhibit potential acquirers.\nWe are prohibited by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness from disposing of any of our business or property, except with the consent of our lenders or if we were to prepay the outstanding indebtedness and related fees in accordance with the loan security agreement. Our outstanding indebtedness may inhibit potential acquirers or other interested parties from seeking to acquire all or a part of our business or assets, and there is no assurance that our lenders would consent to any proposed future transaction that might be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92594, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SLS"}
