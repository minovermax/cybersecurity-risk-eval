On March 12, 2020, the President of the U.S. declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic disruption in the U.S. as many state and local governments have ordered nonessential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. While most of these restrictions were lifted in June of 2020, the actions and continued presence of COVID-19 have resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been a record number of claims for unemployment and stock markets have remained volatile and, in particular, bank stocks have significantly declined in value. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the FRB has reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry, and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when COVID-19 can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be permanently reopened.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u25cf\nif the economy is unable to permanently reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u25cfcollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u25cf\nour allowance for loan losses (\u201cAllowance\u201d) may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u25cfthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u25cf\nas the result of the decline in the FRB\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u25cf\na material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u25cf\na prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could result in our recording additional valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d);\n\u25cf\na prolonged weakness in economic conditions could result in a devaluation of our company value and result in an impairment charge on goodwill;\n\u25cf\nthe unavailability of a critical service from a third party vendor due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u25cf\nFDIC premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding our participation in the PPP and we are subject to the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nThe CARES Act included the PPP as a loan program administered through the SBA. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals were able to apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. Also, there was and continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications, and several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the payment of fees to agents that assisted borrowers in obtaining PPP loans. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although we believe that we have administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, we may be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention related to our participation in the PPP. Any financial liability, litigation costs\nor reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators, and U.S. Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling us to rely on borrower certifications, and take more aggressive action against us for alleged violations of the provisions governing the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition, and thereby adversely affect your investment.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nTerrorist attacks, threats or actual war, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, and other global conflicts may impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs, and stock price in unpredictable ways.\nTerrorist attacks in the U.S. and abroad, as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them, including, without limitation, future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the U.S. or its allies, or military or trade disruptions, may impact our operations. In addition, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, and other global conflicts may impact our operations as well. Any of these events could cause consumer confidence and savings to decrease or could result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our operating results, revenues, and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our common stock and on the future price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Lending and Deposit Activities\nMost of our loans are secured by real estate located in our market area. If there is a downturn in the real estate market, additional borrowers may default on their loans and we may not be able to fully recover our investment in such loans.\nA downturn in the real estate market could adversely affect our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate. Substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional, or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies, and acts of nature.\nIn addition to the risks generally present with respect to mortgage-lending activities, our operations are affected by other factors affecting our borrowers, including:\n\u25cf the ability of our customers to make loan payments;\n\u25cf the ability of our borrowers to attract and retain buyers or tenants, which may in turn be affected by local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for rental space in the area, the attractiveness of properties to buyers and tenants, and competition from other available space, or by the ability of the owner to pay leasing commissions, provide adequate maintenance and insurance, pay tenant improvements costs, and make other tenant concessions;\n\u25cf interest rate levels and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity; and\n\u25cf increased operating costs, including energy costs, real estate taxes, and costs of compliance with environmental controls and regulations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 90% of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate. If real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans will be reduced. Our ability to recover loans in default through the process of foreclosure and subsequent sale of the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to incur financial losses on such loans.\nIn addition, approximately 55% of the book value of our loans consisted of ADC and commercial real estate loans, which present additional risks described in \u201cItem 1. Business - \u201cLending Activities\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur operations are located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession in this area may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nUnlike larger banking organizations that are geographically diversified, our operations are concentrated in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. In addition, nearly all of our loans have been made to borrowers in the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in our market area. A deterioration or decline in economic conditions in this market area could result in one or more of the following:\n\u25cf a decrease in deposits;\n\u25cf an increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u25cf an increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u25cf a decrease in the demand for our products and services; and\n\u25cf a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, and reduction in customers\u2019 borrowing capacities.\nAny of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nOur loan portfolio exhibits a high degree of risk.\nWe have a significant amount of nonresidential loans, as well as construction and land loans granted on a speculative basis. Although permanent single-family, owner-occupied loans currently represent the largest single component of assets and impaired loans, we have a significant level of nonresidential loans, construction loans, and land loans that have an above-average risk exposure.\nAt December 31, 2020, commercial real estate loans totaled $243.4 million, or 37.7% of our loan portfolio and ADC real estate loans totaled $112.9 million, or 17.5% of our loan portfolio. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and ADC real estate loans generally have more risk than the owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and ADC real estate loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, or, in the case of ADC loans, the successful development/construction of a property, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. In addition, commercial real estate and ADC loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential loans. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate and ADC loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nAs our commercial real estate and ADC real estate loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide banking services to customers who do business in the medical-use cannabis industry and the strict enforcement of federal laws regarding medical-use cannabis would likely result in our inability to continue to provide banking services to these customers and we could have legal action taken against us by the federal government.\nWe have deposit and loan customers that are licensed by the state of Maryland to do business in the medical-use cannabis industry as growers, processors, and dispensaries. While medical-use cannabis is legal in the state of Maryland, it remains classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). As such, the cultivation, use, distribution, and possession of cannabis is a violation of federal law that is punishable by imprisonment and fines. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in USA v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 Coop. that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize cannabis, including medical marijuana.\nIn January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) rescinded the \u201cCole Memo\u201d and related memoranda which characterized the enforcement of the CSA against persons and entities complying with state regulatory systems permitting the use, manufacture and sale of medical marijuana as an inefficient use of their prosecutorial resources and discretion. The impact of the DOJ\u2019s rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda is unclear, but may result in the DOJ increasing its enforcement actions against the regulated cannabis industry generally.\nThe U.S. Congress previously enacted an omnibus spending bill that includes a provision prohibiting the DOJ and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds appropriated by that bill to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision, however, expires September 30, 2021. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in USA v. McIntosh that this provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds from relevant appropriations acts to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Congress will extend this provision or that U.S. Federal courts located outside the Ninth Circuit will follow the ruling in USA v. MacIntosh.\nFederal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutor for the District of Maryland will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis, including medical-use cannabis, or that the federal courts in Maryland will follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling in USA v. MacIntosh. Any change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement position, could cause us to immediately cease providing banking services to the medical-use cannabis industry in Maryland.\nAdditionally, as the possession and use of cannabis remains illegal under the CSA, we may be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the services that we provide to these customers and could have legal action taken against us by the Federal government, including imprisonment and fines. Any change in position or potential action taken against us could result in significant financial damage to us and our stockholders.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis business. A financial institution that provides services to a medical-use cannabis related business can comply with BSA disclosure standards by following the FinCEN guidelines. Any adverse change in this FinCEN guidance, any new regulations or legislation, any change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator\u2019s interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a negative impact on our interest income and noninterest income, as well as the cost of our operations, increasing our cost of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and/or otherwise affect us, which may materially affect our profitability.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties on which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose upon and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant\nenvironmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome from mortgage-banking operations is volatile and we may incur losses with respect to our mortgage-banking operations that could negatively affect our earnings.\nA key component of our strategy is to sell on the secondary market the longer term, conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning noninterest income in the form of gains on the sale of the loans. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tend to fall and may reduce the number of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. Although we sell, and intend to continue selling, most loans in the secondary market with limited or no recourse, we are required, and will continue to be required, to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers relating to compliance with applicable law. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers will be able to require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase. We have not been required to repurchase any loans in the last two years.\nWe have established an Allowance based on management\u2019s estimates. Actual losses could differ significantly from those estimates. If the Allowance is not adequate, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and the price of our common stock.\nWe maintain an Allowance, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The Allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the Allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, industry concentrations, and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the Allowance inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the Allowance.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our Allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the Allowance, we may need additional provisions to increase the Allowance. Furthermore, growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses.\nAny increases in the Allowance will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our nonaccrual loans equaled $4.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $632,000 and $(406,000) in net loan recoveries (charge-offs), respectively. At December 31, 2020, the total Allowance was $8.7 million, which was 1.35% of total loans, compared with $7.1 million, which was 1.11% of total loans, as of December 31, 2019.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators, the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for the protection of our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets, and determine the level of our Allowance. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance,\nand monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the ways financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and prepare financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation, or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and may involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the Patriot Act, BSA, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe Patriot Act and BSA require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results and comply with the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. As a result, current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business and stock price and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, referred to as Section 404, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential stockholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe compete with a number of local, regional, and national financial institutions for customers.\nWe face strong competition from savings and loan institutions, banks, and other financial institutions that have branch offices or otherwise operate in our market area, as well as many other companies now offering a range of financial services. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger branch systems than us and offer products that we do not offer. In addition, many of our competitors have higher legal lending limits than us. Particularly intense competition exists for sources of funds including savings and retail time deposits, as well as for loans and other services we offer. Significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in one or more large competitors emerging in our primary target market. The financial resources, human capital, and expertise of one or more large institutions could threaten our ability to maintain our competitiveness.\nWe face intense competitive pressure on customer pricing, which may materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability.\nWe generate net interest income and charge our customers fees based on prevailing market conditions for deposits, loans, and other financial services. In order to increase deposit, loan, and other service volumes, enter new market segments, and expand our base of customers and the size of individual relationships, we must provide competitive pricing for such products and services. In order to stay competitive, we have had to intensify our efforts around attractively pricing our products and services. To the extent that we must continue to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, we will need to grow our volumes and balances in order to offset the effects of declining net interest income and fee-based margins. Increased\npricing pressure also enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives and we may not succeed in these efforts.\nRisks Related to Use of Technology\nThe operations of our business, including our interaction with customers, are increasingly done via electronic means and this has increased our risks related to cyber-attacks.\nWe are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. There has been an increased level of attention focused on cyber-attacks against large corporations that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating cash, other assets, or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and can include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, including the information belonging to our banking customers. Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting our operations.\nWhile we have not incurred any losses related to cyber-attacks, nor are we aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused, increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, litigation, and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nOur business is highly reliant on technology and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with technology.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Our business involves storing and processing sensitive customer data. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could result in theft of customer data or failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, data storage, processing, and other systems. Our inability to access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In addition, we operate a number of money transfer and related electronic, check, and other payment connections that are vulnerable to individuals engaging in fraudulent activities that seek to compromise payments and related financial systems illegally. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers or expose us to civil litigation and regulatory fines and sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly reliant on third-party vendors and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services that are integral to our operations. These vendors provide services that support our operations, including storage and processing of sensitive consumer date. A cyber-security breach of a vendor\u2019s system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes. A material breach of customer data at a service provider\u2019s site may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customer business, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers, result in regulatory\nfines and sanctions, and may result in litigation. In most cases, we remain primarily liable to our customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor\u2019s data security system. We rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber-security controls. We have procedures in place to assess a vendor\u2019s cyber-security controls prior to establishing a contractual relationship and to periodically review assessments of those control systems; however, these procedures are not infallible and a vendor\u2019s system can be breached despite the procedures we employ.\nIf our third-party providers experience financial, operational, or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services and we cannot ensure that we would be able to negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems, without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and, if we are unable to develop and implement efficient and customer friendly technology, we could lose business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to achieve additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the General Banking Industry\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as ours are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest that in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, and the policies of various regulatory agencies. Like all financial institutions, our balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as U.S. Government bonds, corporate securities, and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than those offered by financial institutions such as ours.\nSharply rising interest rates could disrupt domestic and world markets and could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio or our liquidity and results of operations. We expect to experience continual competition for deposit accounts which may make it difficult to reduce the interest paid on some deposits.\nDuring the majority of the first quarter of 2020, the interest rate environment remained stable as compared to the 2019 rate environment. However, near the end of the first quarter of 2020, rates began dropping significantly due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do believe, however, that in the current market environment, we have adequate policies and procedures for maintaining a conservative interest rate sensitive position. There is no assurance that this condition will continue. A sharp movement up or down in deposit rates, loan rates, investment fund rates, and other interest-sensitive instruments on our balance sheet could have a significant, adverse impact on our net interest income and operating results.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in economic and political conditions and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies.\nThe banking industry is affected, directly and indirectly, by local, domestic, and international economic and political conditions, and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment,\nvolatile interest rates, tight money supply, real estate values, international conflicts, and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our potential profitability. Any future rises in interest rates, while increasing the income yield on our earning assets, may adversely affect loan demand and the cost of funds and, consequently, our profitability. Any future decreases in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability because such decreases could reduce the amounts earned on our assets. Economic downturns have resulted and may continue to result in the delinquency of outstanding loans. We do not expect any one particular factor to materially affect our results of operations. However, downtrends in several areas, including real estate, construction, and consumer spending, have had and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our ability to remain profitable. Further, there can be no assurance that the asset values of the loans included in our loan portfolio, the value of properties and other collateral securing such loans, or the value of real estate acquired through foreclosure will remain at current levels.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2017, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the FRB, the ARRC, was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. The ARRC announced SOFR, a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to (i) cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021 and (ii) cease the publication of all other tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six, and twelve month LIBOR) after June 30, 2023. The FRB announced final plans for the production of SOFR, which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 2, 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions and the political discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return on our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these reforms may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR based products, as well as our systems and processes.\nRisks Related to the Investment in our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. However, the average daily trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively small. As a result, trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nBank regulations govern and limit the payment of dividends and capital distributions to stockholders and purchases or redemption by the Company of its stock. Although we paid dividends in 2019 and 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021, this dividend policy will continue to be reviewed in light of future earnings, bank regulations, and other considerations. No assurance can be given, therefore, that cash dividends on our common stock will be paid in the future.\nOur 2035 Debentures contain restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.\nUnder the terms of our Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2035, referred to as the 2035 Debentures, if (i) there has occurred and is continuing an event of default; (ii) we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the related guarantee; or (iii) we have given notice of our election to defer payments of interest on the 2035 Debentures by extending the interest distribution period as provided in the indenture governing the 2035 Debentures and such period, or any extension thereof, has commenced and is continuing, then we may not, among other things, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of our\ncapital stock, including our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we were current on all interest due on the 2035 Debentures.\nAn investment in our securities is not insured against loss.\nInvestments in our common stock are not deposits insured against loss by the FDIC or any other entity. As a result, an investor may lose some or all of his, her, or its investment.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions will make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our equity holders.\nOur charter presently contains certain provisions that may be deemed to be \u201canti-takeover\u201d and \u201canti-greenmail\u201d in nature in that such provisions may deter, discourage, or make more difficult the assumption of control of us by another corporation or person through a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or similar transaction or series of transactions. For example, currently, our charter provides that our Board of Directors may amend the charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of any class that we have authority to issue. In addition, our charter provides for a classified Board, with each Board member serving a staggered three-year term. Directors may be removed only for cause and only with the approval of the holders of at least 75% of our common stock. The overall effects of the \u201canti-takeover\u201d and \u201canti-greenmail\u201d provisions may be to discourage, make more costly or more difficult, or prevent a future takeover offer, prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their securities in a takeover offer, and enhance the possibility that a future bidder for control of us will be required to act through arms-length negotiation with our Board of Directors. These provisions may also have the effect of perpetuating incumbent management.\nOther Risks\nOur brand, reputation, and relationship with our customers are key assets of our business and may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract and retain customers to our products and services is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of us and the industry in which we operate. Our business may be affected by actions taken by competitors, customers, third-party providers, employees, regulators, suppliers, or others that impact the perception of the brand, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as \u201cpredatory,\u201d customer service quality issues, and employee relations issues. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny.\nOur success depends on our senior management team, and if we are not able to retain our senior management team, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team, including Alan J. Hyatt, our Chairman, President, and CEO. We depend on the services of Mr. Hyatt and the other members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our strategies, and maintain and develop our customer relationships. If we are unable to retain Mr. Hyatt and other members of our senior management team, our business could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 89424, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "SVBI"}
