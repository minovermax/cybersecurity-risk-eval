RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In this section, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d refers to the consolidated Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe will be dependent on key individuals and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur success will depend on our ability to retain key individuals and other management personnel. Members of our executive management team, including Luvleen Sidhu, our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Ramsey, our Chief Financial Officer, Warren Taylor, our Chief Customer Officer, Robert Diegel, our Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Crawford, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Jamie Donahue, our Chief Technology Officer, have been integral in building our digital banking platform and developing and growing our disbursement business and BaaS programs. In addition, several members of our executive management team who had been employed by Higher One, Inc. prior to our acquisition of that business, have unique and valuable business experience, relationships and knowledge of the higher education disbursement business. We have entered into employment agreements with Luvleen Sidhu, Warren Taylor, Robert Diegel, Andrew Crawford, and Jamie Donahue, however, the continued service of these individuals cannot be assured, and if we lose the services of any of these individuals, they would be difficult to replace, and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a limited history operating as a separate entity and a limited history operating independently of Customers Bank, and our management team has limited experience managing us.\nWe are a relatively new legal entity and have a limited operating history and limited history operating independently of Customers Bank since our January 2021 divestiture. An integral portion of our business was acquired from Higher One in June 2016, and our business had been operating primarily as a division of Customers Bank, and since September 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank. There may be unanticipated risks and expenses that come from no longer operating as a division or wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank, such as increased compliance costs and licensing requirements. In addition, we have a limited history of managing cash, liquidity, financial obligations and resources, and other operational needs independent of Customers Bank. Because of our limited operating history, there are only limited historical results of operations for you to review and consider in evaluating our results of operations, and our prospects. We will be subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with recently formed entities with limited operating history, including the risk that we will not achieve our strategic plan.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled sales, management, and technical personnel.\nOur future success depends upon our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, and retain highly qualified personnel, including skilled technical, management, product, technology, and sales and marketing personnel, all of whom are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet our requirements, or that we will be able to do so at salary, benefit and other compensation costs that are acceptable. A loss of a substantial number of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.\nOur business and future success may suffer if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our strategy.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to generate revenues by providing financial transaction services to higher education institutions and their students directly and through our referral partners, including TouchNet, and our ability to implement and grow our BaaS and Workplace businesses, including the growth and implementation of T-Mobile MONEY. The market for these services has only recently developed and our viability and profitability is therefore unproven. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to develop and market products and services that achieve and maintain market acceptance.\nOutsourcing disbursement services may not become as widespread in the higher education industry as anticipated, and our products and services may not achieve continued commercial success. In addition, higher education institutional clients could discontinue using our services and return to in-house disbursement and payment solutions. If outsourcing disbursement services does not become widespread, or if institutional clients return to their prior methods of disbursement, our growth prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur strategic growth plan depends, in part, on our ability to enter into new agreements with higher education institutions and new BaaS partners. These contracts can generally be terminated by the client at will and, therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these clients or maintain agreements with clients on terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition, we may not be able to continue to establish new relationships with higher education institutional clients or new BaaS partners at our historical growth rate or at all. The termination of current client contracts or an inability to continue to attract new clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNot only are establishing new client relationships and maintaining current ones critical to our business, they are also essential components of our strategy for maximizing student usage of our products and services and attracting new student customers as well as our graduate strategy. A reduction in enrollment, a failure to attract and maintain student customers, as well as any future demographic trends that reduce the number of higher education students, could materially and adversely affect our capability for both revenue and cash generation and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur strategic growth plan relies on our ability to increase customers\u2019 debit card spending and attract them to our new products. If we are unable to increase debit card usage through product education, marketing, promotions, and technological improvements, or if debit card usage drops as a result of trends, market perception, or new or competing products, our growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFinally, an integral part of our growth strategy is our ability to expand our disbursements expertise into new markets and product offerings, including BaaS partnerships and credit products. Our management team has limited experience forming BaaS partnerships and running a credit products business. If we are unable to develop lending programs or BaaS programs, if we cannot gain market adoption of the credit products business or BaaS products due to competition, regulatory issues or constraints or otherwise, if large businesses pursue other alternatives to a BaaS partnership, or if the market for BaaS products and services is smaller than anticipated, our earnings and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may not grow at our projected rates.\nWe may not be able to grow adoption and retention rates.\nOur growth strategy and business projections contemplate a significant increase in adoption and retention rates for our products. A significant component of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to have students of our higher education institution clients, and customers of our BaaS partners, including T-Mobile MONEY customers and employees with our workplace banking partners, select our services and become long-term users of our products. In particular, our growth strategy will depend on our ability to successfully cross-sell our core products and services to students after they leave college as well as growth in product usage from BaaS and workplace banking customers. We may not be successful in implementing this strategy because these students and customers may believe that our products and services are unnecessary or unattractive. In addition to a sensitivity to adoption rates, we are also sensitive to retention rates. As students leave college or customers leave a BaaS partner or change employers, we will face increasing competition from banks and other financial services providers.\nOur failure to attract and retain students, employees, and other customers could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our projections and models assume a significant increase in both adoption and retention rates. If these rates do not increase as projected, our growth, revenues and results of operations may not meet our projections.\nFailure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe continued rapid expansion and development of our business may place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our growth strategy contemplates further increasing the number of our higher education institutional clients and student banking customers.\nThe rate at which we have been able to establish relationships with our customers in the past, however, may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to establish additional customer relationships in the future. Further, our growth contemplates an increase in BaaS business, including significant growth of T-Mobile MONEY, and new initiatives with additional BaaS partners. Our success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. Our ability to grow will also depend on our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees, obtain financing for capital needs, expand our systems effectively, allocate human resources optimally, assure regulatory compliance, and address any regulatory issues, maintain clear lines of communication between our operational functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressures on management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations, or that we will be able to manage growth effectively or achieve further growth at all. If our business does not continue to grow, or if we fail to manage any future growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy is based on assumptions, which may not be accurate; additionally, macro trends and key partner actions are not fully within our control.\nOur growth strategy and business outlook are based on estimates our management believes to be reasonable, but there are many factors that may be outside of management\u2019s control or may be difficult to predict. Some of these uncertainties include:\n\u2022Our growth strategy is depending on adding additional BaaS partners. The timing, size, and partnership terms are not fully known today and could have a significant impact on our outlook and results of operations. Currently, T-Mobile is our only material BaaS partner.\n\u2022Our current BaaS business is significantly dependent on our BaaS business with T-Mobile, and T-Mobile\u2019s efforts to market the program and promote growth in accounts. If T-Mobile does not market the product as expected, or if there are changes in the economic relationship with T-Mobile or its investment appetite in the business, it could impact our financial projections and results of operations.\n\u2022Workplace Banking is a new and relatively unproven strategy; our outlook is based on estimated penetration rates of large employers, benefits market places, and other FinTech companies involved in payment of wages. Those companies may not market the product as effectively as projected or utilize our platform to the extent projected; other unknown factors in this new business, such as the rate of adoption, promotional costs, and costs of signing new partners, may cause results to materially differ from our estimates.\n\u2022Macro industry trends may impact the amounts of student disbursements or the likelihood that students choose a BankMobile-serviced account. ED regulation, industry competition, the rise of competing low-cost products, or other unknown shifts could impact the growth in the student business. The lasting impact of COVID-19 on the higher education industry is still unknown, but changes in enrollment at our client schools or changes in the amounts disbursed could negatively impact projections and results of operations. Student revenue growth is dependent on our ability to charge the current level of fees, which could be negatively impacted by competition or changes in industry trends. Revenue growth is also dependent on interchange income rates, ATM visits, and other factors that may shift over time.\n\u2022Interest rates are unknown; higher rates of interest may reduce the relative attractiveness of the deposit products we service for our partner banks. Interest rate changes may reduce the deposit servicing fee that is paid to us by our Partner Bank or that we can charge to future partner banks.\n\u2022Future bank partnerships will have individually negotiated terms; the economics of those partnerships may differ from the current arrangement. We have a commitment from our Partner Bank through the end of 2022, but we may not be able to secure similar terms after that time.\n\u2022In November 2021, we announced a bank merger that will enable us to keep deposits on our own Consolidated Balance Sheets; but until the merger closes, we must maintain deposits off-balance sheet with our Partner Bank. Only after the merger closes, can we begin to move these deposits onto our Consolidated Balance Sheets. After we move deposits to our Consolidated Balance Sheets, our servicing fee income will be replaced by net interest income which will be determined by our asset mix, yields, and deposit cost.\nOur partnership with T-Mobile may expose us to additional risks.\nIn February 2017, we entered into a significant strategic partnership with T-Mobile for the development and roll-out of a mobile banking platform, referred to as T-Mobile MONEY, which was publicly announced in the third quarter of 2018. The T-Mobile MONEY program was extended to the Sprint customers acquired by T-Mobile in August 2020. T-Mobile MONEY represents the most significant BaaS initiative undertaken by us to date. However, T-Mobile MONEY may not be as successful as currently expected for a variety of reasons, including customer adoption of the product, the level of marketing by T-Mobile, general economic conditions, competition and product alternatives and other factors. If T-Mobile MONEY does not reach the anticipated activity levels and deposit balances relating to T-Mobile MONEY customers are lower than expected, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have and will in the future create new products in connection with the T-Mobile MONEY offering, many of which will be complex, with possible conditional requirements, options, and variations, along with changes to terms that necessitate additional disclosures or actions to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. The offerings through T-Mobile MONEY may be marketed similar to retail products, with a variety of ancillary offerings, such as rewards programs, further increasing the inherent compliance risk. While we will have final authority on the design of products, some components of the product life cycle may be managed by T-Mobile, such as promotions of the product by T-Mobile. Since we will not have direct control over all aspects of the product life cycle, the relationship involves significant third party relationship management requirements, indicating a significant level of inherent compliance risk.\nDemographically, the T-Mobile MONEY product seeks to serve a broader and more diverse population than traditional banking. The BaaS market is very competitive, requiring products, channels, and services to be recalibrated often to remain attractive to potential customers and BaaS partners. As such, the level and maturity of new product approval processes, change management and the robustness of strategic planning must be sophisticated enough to respond to competitive demands with timely and meaningful evaluation of compliance risk.\nOur agreements with white-label partners, such as T-Mobile, may expose us to additional compliance risk. For example, employees of the BaaS partner may be incentivized to promote products under a discretionary compensation program to promote financial products to customers, thus increasing exposure to compliance risk. White-label partnerships may also expose us to issues in connection with privacy-related regulations based on the partner receiving certain data regarding the account holders and their use of the program, which may also be used for marketing purposes. Opt-out and notice may be required in connection with these disclosures.\nShort message service (\u201cSMS\u201d) text messaging will be used extensively in carrying out service-related communications and possibly marketing-related communications as well. Since express consent is required for service-related communications to wireless subscribers, it will be critical to ensure that the language in disclosures and the account agreement indicate this consent. Moreover, the consumer must have the right to revoke all of these communications to their wireless numbers. Failure to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), could result in significant fines to T-Mobile and/or to us.\nThe private label agreement with respect to T-Mobile MONEY has been renewed for an additional term of three years and may only be renewed for an additional term of two years by T-Mobile; T-Mobile\u2019s failure to renew after the second term could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe private label agreement between Customers Bancorp, Inc. and T-Mobile that governs T-Mobile MONEY had an initial term of three years. The term was extended an additional three years to February 2023. The renewal term may be renewed for an additional term of two years at the option of T-Mobile. We will have the option to terminate at each renewal of the agreement. T-Mobile has no obligation to renew the agreement. T-Mobile\u2019s failure to renew the agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, T-Mobile may renew the agreement on terms that are different or less favorable to us.\nTo date we have derived our revenue from a limited number of products and markets. Our efforts to expand market reach and product portfolio may not succeed and may reduce revenue growth.\nOur BaaS strategy entails facilitating deposits and banking services between a customer and an FDIC insured partner bank. While we offer our digital banking platform and disbursements services to our customers the lending products and services historically offered to non-enrolled students and other customers through our business have been limited. Many competitors offer a more diverse set of products and services to customers and operate in additional markets.\nWhile we intend to eventually broaden the scope of products offered to customers with our banking partners through our BaaS and mobile banking product offerings, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our failure to broaden the scope of the products we offer to potential customers may inhibit the growth of repeat business from customers and harm our operating results of operation. There also can be no guarantee that we will be successful with respect to our expansion through our mobile banking platform with new partners and into new markets where we currently do not operate, which could also inhibit the growth of our business and results of operations.\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for signing potential higher education institutional clients and BaaS partners could delay new sales of our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe sales cycle between our business\u2019 initial contact with potential higher education institutional clients, BaaS partners, and large employers and the signing of a contract with that client, partner or employer can be lengthy, as the individual agreements need to be negotiated and partnerships customized. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, our ability to forecast accurately the timing of revenues associated with new sales is limited. The sales cycle will vary widely due to significant uncertainties, over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022the individual decision-making processes of each higher education institutional client, BaaS partner or large employer, which typically include extensive and lengthy evaluations and will require spending substantial time, effort and money educating each client and partner about the value of our products and services;\n\u2022the budgetary constraints and priorities and budget cycle of each higher education institutional client or partner;\n\u2022the reluctance of higher education staff, BaaS partners or large employers to change or modify existing processes and procedures; and\n\u2022the amount of customization and negotiation required for any given collaboration.\nIn addition, there is significant upfront time and expense required to develop relationships and there is no guarantee that a potential client will sign a contract with our business even after substantial time, effort and money has been spent on the potential client. A delay in our ability or a failure to enter into new contracts with potential higher education institutional clients could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasing competition in the industries in which we do business.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid technological change. Our disbursement services compete against all forms of payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks), electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) payments and other electronic forms of payment, including card-based payment systems. Many competitors, including Blackboard, Heartland Payment Systems and Nelnet, Inc., provide payment software, products and services that compete with those that we and our partner banks offer. In addition, the banking products and services offered on our platform will also compete with banks that focus on the higher education market, including U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Company. Future competitors may begin to focus on higher education institutions in a manner similar to us. We also face significant competition for our BaaS products and workplace banking services from other BaaS providers and digital consumer banking platforms such as Chime and Green Dot, as well as from traditional consumer banks. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may in the future offer a wider range of products and services and may use advertising and marketing strategies that achieve broader brand recognition or acceptance. In addition, competitors may develop new products, services or technologies that render our products, services or technologies obsolete or less marketable. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on a strong brand and a failure to maintain and develop that brand in a cost-effective manner may hurt our ability to expand our customer base.\nMaintaining and developing the \u201cBankMobile,\u201d \u201cBankMobile\u2019s Student Banking\u201d and \u201cBankMobile\u2019s Disbursements\u201d brands will be critical to expanding and maintaining our base of higher education institution clients, students and other account holders.\nWe believe the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Maintaining and developing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high quality products and services at cost effective and competitive prices, as well as after-sale customer service. While we intend to continue investing in our brand, no assurance can be given as to the success of these investments. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, incur excessive expenses in this effort or our reputation is otherwise tainted, including by association with the wider financial services industry or because of data security breaches or negative press, we may be unable to maintain loyalty among our existing customers or attract new customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be liable to customers or lose customers if we provide poor service or if we experience systems or product failures, if any agreements that we maintain with colleges, universities and BaaS partners are terminated or if other performance triggers or other performance conditions are triggered.\nWe are required to fulfill our contractual obligations with respect to our products and services and our high quality service to meet the expectations of customers. Failure to meet these expectations or fulfill our contractual obligations could cause us to lose customers and bear additional liability.\nBecause of the large amount of data we collect and manage, hardware failures and errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain significant inaccuracies. For example, errors in our processing systems could delay disbursements or cause disbursements to be made in the wrong amounts or to the wrong person. Our systems may also experience service interruptions as a result of undetected errors or defects in software, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism, accident or other similar reason, in which case we may experience delays in returning to full service, especially with regard to data centers and customer service call centers. If problems such as these occur, our customers may seek compensation, withhold payments, seek full or partial refunds, terminate their agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures. In addition, we may be subject to claims made by third parties also affected by any of these problems.\nIn addition, our agreements with colleges, universities, BaaS partners and large employers contain and will contain certain termination rights, performance triggers and other conditions which, if exercised or triggered, may result in penalties and/or early termination of such agreements, which could cause us to be liable to customers or lose customers, thereby materially impacting our operations.\nDemand for our banking products and other services may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological changes.\nWe operate in a dynamic industry characterized by rapidly evolving technology and frequent product introductions. We rely on proprietary technology to pass on cost savings to customers and make our platform convenient for customers to access. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new products, expand current products into new markets, and operate a full-service digital banking platform. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior customer experience, customers\u2019 demand for our banking products and other services may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed.\nA change in the availability of student loans or financial aid, as well as budget constraints, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance by reducing demand for our services.\nThe higher education industry depends heavily upon the ability of students to obtain student loans and financial aid. As part of our contracts with higher education institutional clients that use our disbursements services, students\u2019 financial aid and other refunds are sent to us for disbursement. The fees that we will charge most of our clients will be based on the number of financial aid disbursements made to students. In addition, our relationships with higher education institutional clients will provide us with a market for BankMobile Vibe accounts, from which we anticipate we will derive a significant proportion of our revenues. If the availability of student loans and financial aid were to decrease, the number of enrolled students could decrease and our addressable market for student disbursement services would shrink. Future legislative and executive branch efforts to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit or worsening economic conditions may require the government to severely curtail its financial aid spending, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the availability and cost of student loans could also affect enrollment, in turn affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on steady enrollment in traditional (on-campus) and non-traditional (online) institutions of higher education. The current COVID situation is creating uncertainty with individuals applying for the benefit of higher education.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated response has put the higher education industry into a period of unprecedented disruption. Many physical campuses are operating remotely or only partially available. Students are displaced and learning at a distance. There is uncertainty as to whether schools will open their physical campuses in some parts of the country, and for many, the upcoming semester may be postponed or cancelled. It is uncertain how quickly the U.S. education system, the economy and human behavior returns to business-as-usual, if at all. A sustained disruption in the higher education industry could affect the demand for disbursements and the number of higher education accounts and the use of such accounts, which could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending and demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA decrease in consumer confidence due to the weakening of the global economy, or disruptions to on-campus schooling or consumer spending resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause decreased spending among our student and graduate customers and may decrease the use of account and card products and services. Increases in college tuition alongside stagnation or reduction in available financial aid may also restrict spending among college students and the size of disbursements, reducing the use of our account and card products and services and the demand for our disbursement services. Weakening economic conditions, such as decreases in consumer spending, increased consumer credit defaults and bankruptcies, inflation and rising unemployment, may also adversely affect the demand for and use of our BaaS products and workplace banking platform and associated products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur disbursement business depends in part on the current government financial aid regime that relies on the outsourcing of financial aid disbursements through higher education institutions.\nIn general, the U.S. federal government distributes financial aid to students through higher education institutions as intermediaries. Following the receipt of financial aid funds and the payment of tuition and other expenses, higher education institutions have typically processed refund disbursements to students by preparing and distributing paper checks. Our disbursements service provides higher education institutional clients with an electronic system for improving the administrative efficiency of this refund disbursement process. If the government, through legislation or regulatory action, restructured the existing financial aid regime in such a way that reduced or eliminated the intermediary role played by higher education financial institutions or limited or regulated the role played by service providers such as us, our business, results of operations and prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nBreaches of security measures, unauthorized access to or disclosure of data relating to clients, fraudulent activity, and infrastructure failures could materially and adversely affect our reputation or harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will have access to certain \u201cpersonally identifiable\u201d information of customers, including student contact information, identification numbers and the amount of credit balances, which customers expect will be maintained confidentially. It is possible that hackers, customers or employees acting unlawfully or contrary to our policies or other individuals, could improperly access our or our vendors\u2019 systems and obtain or disclose data about customers. Further, because customer data may also be collected, stored, or processed by third-party vendors, it is possible that these vendors could intentionally or negligently disclose data about our clients or customers. Data breaches could also occur at our partner banks, higher institution clients, BaaS partners and large employer partners, which could negatively affect our reputation, relationships with end users, and expose us and our clients and customers. Any such breaches or loss of data could negatively affect our business, growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will rely to a large extent on sophisticated information technology systems, databases, and infrastructure, and will take reasonable steps to protect them. However, due to their size, complexity, content and integration with or reliance on third-party systems they are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, natural disaster and random attack, all of which pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A breach of our information systems could lead to fraudulent activity, including with respect to our cards, such as identity theft, losses on the part of banking customers, additional security costs, negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition, our customers could be subject to scams that may result in the release of sufficient information concerning the customer or our accounts to allow others unauthorized access to our accounts or our systems (e.g., \u201cphishing\u201d and \u201csmishing\u201d). Claims for compensatory or other damages may be brought against us as a result of a breach of our systems or fraudulent activity. If we are unsuccessful in defending against any resulting claims, we may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, a significant incident of fraud or an increase in fraud levels generally involving our products, such as our cards, could result in reputational damage, which could reduce the use of our products and services. Such incidents of fraud could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could increase our compliance costs. Accordingly, account data breaches and related fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.\nOur business will depend on certain registered and unregistered intellectual property rights and proprietary information. We will rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and technical measures (such as the password protection and encryption of our data and systems) to protect our technology and intellectual property rights, including our proprietary software. Existing laws will afford only limited protection for our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights or registrations granted to us may provide an inadequate competitive advantage or be too narrow to protect our products and services. Similarly, there is no guarantee that our pending applications for intellectual property protection will result in registrations or issued patents or sufficiently protect our rights. The protections outlined above may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology and may not prevent competitors from copying, infringing, or misappropriating our products and services. We cannot be certain that others will not independently develop, design around or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our business and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOne or more of the issued patents or pending patent applications relating to us may be categorized as so-called \u201cbusiness method\u201d patents. The general validity of software patents and business method patents has been challenged in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. Our patents may become less valuable or unenforceable if software or business methods are found to be a non-patentable subject matter or if additional requirements are imposed that our patents do not meet.\nWe also rely on numerous marks, trademarks and service marks, including \u201cBankMobile,\u201d \u201cBankMobile Vibe\u201d and \u201cBankMobile Disbursements.\u201d If the validity of these marks were challenged, our brand may be damaged or we may be required to face considerable expense defending or changing our marks.\nWe may incorporate open source software into our products. While the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes conditions or restrictions on our ability to offer our products and services. In such event, we could be required to make the source code for certain of our proprietary software available to third parties, which may include competitors, to seek licenses from third-parties, to re-engineer, or to discontinue the offering of our products or services, or we could become subject to other consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and operating expenses.\nWe may be subject to claims that our services or solutions violate the patents or other intellectual property of others, which would be costly and time-consuming to defend. If our services and solutions are found to infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices or pay significant costs and monetary penalties.\nThe services and solutions that we provide may infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. The industry in which we operate is characterized by frequent claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement. We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the products of others that we use or offer to our clients, do not and will not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients. If others claim that we have infringed upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be liable for significant damages and incur significant legal fees and expenses. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify many of our clients against claims that the services and solutions provided by us infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. In some instances, the potential amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues received from the client.\nRegardless of merit, any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be resolved on unfavorable terms, damage our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such results could limit our ability to provide a solution or service to clients and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nTermination of, or changes to, the MasterCard association registration could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe student checking account debit cards issued in connection with our disbursement business and the consumer checking account debit cards issued in connection with BaaS programs and workplace programs are subject to MasterCard association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by MasterCard for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us. The termination of the card association registration held by us or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide products and services and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe fees that we will generate are subject to competitive pressures and are subject to change, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe will generate revenue from, among other sources, agreements with our Partner Bank to share the banking services fees charged to our account holders, interchange fees related to purchases made through our debit cards, deposit servicing fees from our Partner Bank, and fees charged to our higher education institution clients. In an increasingly price-conscious and competitive market, it is possible that to maintain our competitive position with higher education institutions, BaaS partners, and large employers, we may have to decrease the fees charged for our services. Similarly, in order to maintain our competitive position with our Partner Bank, we may need to reduce deposit servicing fees we charge. In order to maintain our competitive position with account holders, we and our Partner Bank may need to reduce banking service fees charged to account holders.\nMasterCard could reduce the interchange rates, which it unilaterally sets and adjusts from time to time, which would negatively affect the interchange revenue that we share with our partner banks. In addition, account holders may modify their spending habits and increase their use of automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d) relative to their use of debit cards, as ACH payments are generally free, which could reduce the interchange fees remitted to us. If our fees are reduced as described above, our business, results of operations and prospects for future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a Deposit Processing Services Agreement in place with our current Partner Bank. The Deposit Processing Services Agreement will expire on December 31, 2022, and will automatically renew for an additional three year term unless either party elects not to renew. Our Partner Bank has indicated that it will not renew the current Deposit Processing Services Agreement under existing terms. We are considering multiple strategic alternatives in the event the Deposit Processing Services Agreement is not renewed including internalizing services upon the merger with FSB, partnering with other banks, utilizing a brokered deposit model, or entering into discussions with our current Partner Bank about a new Deposit Processing Services Agreement after December 31, 2022 at then current market rates and conditions. If we are unable to merge with FSB before the Deposit Processing Services Agreement expires, and are unable to pursue our alternative strategies on favorable terms, or at all, it could materially affect our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, upon an expiration of the Deposit Processing Services Agreement, if we have not completed our merger with FSB, the amount of interchange revenues we may earn will be dependent on entering into agreements with qualifying partner banks. Our partner banks are subject to extensive regulation as banks, which could limit or restrict our activities.\nWe outsource critical operations, which will expose us to risks related to our third-party vendors.\nWe have entered into contracts with third-party vendors to provide critical services, technology and software in our operations. These outsourcing partners include, among others: FIS, which provides back-end account and transaction data processing as well as web and application hosting services in secure data centers; MasterCard, which provides the payment network for our cards, as well as for certain other transactions; and Ubiquity Global Services, which provides customer care services.\nAccordingly, we depend, in part, on the services, technology and software of these and other third-party service providers. In the event that these service providers fail to maintain adequate levels of support, do not provide high quality service, discontinue their lines of business, terminate our contractual arrangements or cease or reduce operations, we may be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could materially disrupt our operations and could divert management\u2019s time and resources. We may also be unable to establish comparable new third-party relationships on as favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain replacement technology, software or services there may be a disruption or delay in our ability to operate our business or to provide products and services, and the replacement technology, software or services might be more expensive than those we have currently. The process of transitioning services and data from one provider to another can be complicated, time consuming and may lead to significant disruptions in our business. In addition, any failure by third-party service providers to maintain adequate internal controls could negatively affect our internal control over financial reporting, which could impact the preparation and quality of our financial statements.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could affect our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company is an emerging growth company and may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As an emerging growth company, the Company is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management is required to make an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(a). This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in internal control over financial reporting.\nAs described in Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, management has identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company has developed a remediation plan to address the identified material weaknesses. If the Company\u2019s remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and it could be required to revise or restate its financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nAny inability to successfully integrate our recent or future mergers and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMergers and acquisitions typically require integration of the acquired companies\u2019 sales and marketing, operating, manufacturing, distribution, finance and administrative functions, as well as exposure to different legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated. We may not be able to integrate successfully any business we acquire into our existing business, or may not be able to do so in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our inability to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs and lower profits. Factors affecting the successful integration of acquired businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 our inability to manage acquired businesses or control integration costs and other costs relating to mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\u2022 diverting the attention of our management and that of the acquired business;\n\u2022 merging or linking different accounting and financial reporting systems and systems of internal controls;\n\u2022 merging computer, technology and other information networks and systems;\n\u2022 assimilating personnel, human resources and other administrative departments and potentially contrasting\ncorporate cultures;\n\u2022 failure to retain existing key personnel of the acquired businesses and recruit qualified new employees at new\nlocations;\n\u2022 disrupting our relationship with, or loss of, key customers or suppliers;\n\u2022 incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 interfering with, or loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or that of the acquired company; and\n\u2022 delays or cost-overruns in the integration process.\nAny of these acquisition or other integration-related issues could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our day-to-day operations, cause significant disruption to our businesses, and lead to substantial additional costs. Our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of a merger or acquisition or to successfully integrate acquired companies as well as other transaction-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, possible future mergers, acquisitions, or dispositions may trigger a review by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and/or the State Attorneys General under their respective regulatory authority, focusing on the effects on competition, including the size or structure of the relevant markets and the pro-competitive benefits of the transaction. Any delay, prohibition or modification required by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the terms of a proposed merger or acquisition or could require us to modify or abandon an otherwise attractive acquisition opportunity.\nWe face a number of risks relating to our announced plans to merge with First Sound Bank.\nOn November 14, 2021, we entered into the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger with FSB, a Washington state-chartered bank. The completion of the merger will be subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals from both FSB and BM Technologies shareholders, and other customary closing conditions. Certain of the conditions will not be within our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the merger as anticipated, or at all.\nOur performance after consummating the FSB merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate FSB with our business in a cost-effective manner that does not significantly disrupt our consolidated operations. Additionally, our ability to execute on our plan will require additional capital which we may be unable to raise on favorable terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and grow our business and operations during, and following, the integration. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations, products, and personnel of FSB involve complex operational and personnel-related challenges. This process has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, may disrupt our business, and may not result in the full benefits expected from the merger. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:\n\u2022 difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022 loss of customers and inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022 issues in integrating information technology, services, communications, regulatory compliance and other systems;\n\u2022 incompatibility of logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;\n\u2022 merging corporate and administrative infrastructures; and\n\u2022 unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger.\nAdditionally, the continued integration of our operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAfter the combination with FSB, we will be subject to additional regulation as a federally insured depository institution and state chartered bank. We may face additional compliance costs and burden of being in a highly-regulated industry. Finally, we may not receive the benefits of being a chartered bank in the time or scale that we anticipate, which could affect our prospects and results of operations.\nThe failure to consummate the merger with First Sound Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn November 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our business with FSB. The business combination is expected to be consummated prior to December 31, 2022. The business combination is a part of our broader strategic plan to become a fully integrated fintech driven bank and will allow us to internalize the deposit taking function and eliminate our dependence on our Partner Bank. If we fail to consummate the merger, we may have to renegotiate our business arrangements with our Partner Bank, including our Deposit Processing Services Agreement (which our Partner Bank has the right to terminate as early as December 31, 2022), or with another partner bank, and renegotiate certain business arrangements with certain of our other business partners. We cannot guarantee those agreements or arrangements will be renegotiated on similar or better terms or, alternatively, will be replaced by agreements or arrangements with new business partners on similar or better terms. As a result, the failure to consummate the merger transaction with FSB could have a material adverse effect on our business going forward.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Warrants\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the further development of a trading market on NYSE American or otherwise in the future or how active and liquid that market may become. If an active and liquid trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock. Among other things, in the absence of a liquid public trading market:\n\u2022you may not be able to liquidate your investment in shares of common stock;\n\u2022you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price attributed to them in the business combination;\n\u2022the market price of shares of common stock may experience significant price volatility; and\n\u2022there may be less efficiency in carrying out your purchase and sale orders.\nIf securities analysts publish negative evaluations of our common stock or if we lose analysts resulting in loss of research coverage or their evaluations of our stock are downgraded, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have limited research coverage by industry and financial analysts. However, the few analysts that provide coverage of us could stop and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our common stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our common stock price to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. Certain shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers, and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. Certain of our stockholders and members of our management have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering shares of our common stock or to include shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Any such sales, including sales of a substantial number of shares or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We may also issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in ownership dilution to you as a stockholder and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of the Company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions, including, among other things:\n\u2022provisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our stockholders, to authorize by resolution the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to establish the number of shares to be included in such series, along with the preferential rights determined by our board of directors;\n\u2022provided that, our board of directors may also, subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock, authorize shares of preferred stock to be increased or decreased by the approval of the board of directors and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation;\n\u2022provisions that impose advance notice requirements, minimum shareholding periods and ownership thresholds, and other requirements and limitations on the ability of stockholders to propose matters for consideration at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022a staggered board whereby our directors are divided into three classes, with each class subject to retirement and reelection once every three years on a rotating basis.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our business in a tender offer or similar transaction. With our staggered board of directors, at least two annual meetings of stockholders will generally be required in order to effect a change in a majority of our directors. Our staggered board of directors can discourage proxy contests for the election of directors and purchases of substantial blocks of our shares by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (excluding any placement warrants held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our common stock in the event the shares of our common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of our common stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date it gives notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time it redeems the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available.\nIf and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force a warrant holder: (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, will be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nOur Warrants could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021 there were warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 23,873,167 shares of our common stock. These warrants consist of 16,928,889 warrants originally included in the units issued in Megalith\u2019s initial public offering and 6,945,778 private placement warrants less the public warrants exercised during the current year. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share and will generally expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on January 4, 2026 or earlier upon redemption of our common stock. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock.\nRegulatory Risks\nA change in regulations related to interchange or methods of payments could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFuture federal, state or network regulations could be changed in a way that could negatively affect our business. Additionally, with the advent of creative money movement systems that bypass card networks, a large future proportionate share of \u201cspend\u201d could leverage a less income producing method. In turn, these events could significantly reduce our interchange income from which we currently expect to derive a significant proportion of our revenues, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various regulations related to higher education and disbursements.\nThird-Party Servicer\nBecause we provide services to some higher education institutions that involve handling federal student financial aid funds, we are considered a \u201cthird-party servicer\u201d under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs the administration of federal student financial aid programs. Those regulations require a third-party servicer annually to submit a compliance audit conducted by outside independent auditors that cover the servicer\u2019s Title IV activities. Each year we are required to submit a \u201cCompliance Attestation Examination of the Title IV Student Financial Assistance Programs\u201d audit to the ED, which includes a report by an independent audit firm. This yearly compliance audit submission to ED provides comfort to our higher education institution clients that we are in compliance with applicable third-party servicer regulations. We also provide and will provide this compliance audit report to clients upon request to help them fulfill their compliance audit obligations as Title IV participating institutions.\nUnder ED\u2019s regulations, a third-party servicer that contracts with a Title IV institution acts in the nature of a fiduciary in the administration of Title IV programs. Among other requirements, the regulations provide that a third-party servicer is jointly and severally liable with its client institution for any liability to ED arising out of the servicer\u2019s violation of Title IV or its implementing regulations, which could subject us to material fines related to acts or omissions of entities beyond our control. ED is also empowered to limit, suspend or terminate the violating servicer\u2019s eligibility to act as a third-party servicer and to impose significant civil penalties on the violating servicer. We may enter into \u201cTier 1\u201d arrangements with educational institutions, which are subject to more stringent regulations than certain other \u201cTier 2\u201d or \u201cnon-covered\u201d arrangements.\nAdditionally, on behalf of our higher education institution clients, we are required to comply with ED\u2019s cash management regulations regarding payment of financial aid credit balances to students and providing bank accounts to students that may be used for receiving such payments. In the event ED concludes that we have violated Title IV or its implementing regulations and should be subject to one or more sanctions, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. There is limited enforcement and interpretive history of Title IV regulations.\nFinal rules relating to Title IV Cash Management were published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2015. The Final Rules include, among others, provisions related to (i) restrictions on the ability of higher education institutions and third-party servicers like us to market financial products to students including sending unsolicited debit cards to students, (ii) prohibitions on the assessment of certain types of account fees on student account holders, and (iii) requirements related to ATM access for student account holders that became effective as of July 1, 2016.\nThese regulations also require institutions to: offer students additional choices regarding how to receive their student aid funds (including prohibiting an institution from requiring students to open an account into which their credit balances must be deposited); provide a list of account options from which a student may choose to receive credit balance funds electronically, where each option is presented in a neutral manner and the student\u2019s preexisting bank account is listed as the first and most prominent option with no account preselected; ensure electronic payments made to a student\u2019s preexisting account are initiated in a manner as timely as, and no more onerous than, payments made to an account with the institution); include additional restrictions on the institution\u2019s use of personally identifiable information; require that the terms of the contractual arrangements between institutions and schools be publicly disclosed; and require that schools establish and evaluate the contractual arrangements with institutions in light of the best financial interests of students. These regulations increase our compliance costs and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur partner banks are subject to extensive regulation as a bank, which could limit or restrict our activities.\nBanking is a highly regulated industry and our partner banks are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. As a service provider, we will be required to comply with many of these regulations on behalf of our partner banks, which will be costly and restrict certain of our activities, including loans and interest rates charged and interest rates paid on deposits.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our partner banks, and our own business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, which we refer to as the Dodd-Frank Act, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. The \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d of the Dodd-Frank Act limits the amount of interchange fees chargeable by a bank with over $10 billion in assets. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect our revenues, business and operations in substantial and unpredictable ways.\nFurther, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on our partner banks, and by extension, a negative impact on us. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our partner banks and on our own business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our Partner Bank is now over $10 billion in assets and is subject to the Durbin Amendment, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Pursuant to the Deposit Processing Services Agreement between us and our Partner Bank, it will reimburse us for a portion of the interchange fee lost as a result of being subject to the Durbin Amendment. However, we may not be able to find another banking partner that is not subject to the Durbin Amendment in the future or at all, or on terms that are attractive to us, and having a banking partner that is subject to the Durbin Amendment could reduce interchange revenue and negatively affect our prospects and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur ability to limit our liabilities by contract or through insurance may be ineffective or insufficient to cover future liabilities.\nWe will attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages arising from negligence, errors, mistakes or security breaches. Contractual limitations on liability, however, may not be enforceable or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. We will maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions. It is possible, however, that claims could exceed the amount of applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d)\nOur higher education institution clients are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1995 (\u201cFERPA\u201d), which provides, with certain exceptions, that an educational institution that receives any federal funding under a program administered by ED may not have a policy or practice of disclosing education records or \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d from education records, other than directory information, to third parties without the student\u2019s or parent\u2019s written consent. Our higher education institution clients disclose to us certain non-directory information concerning their students, including contact information, student identification numbers and the amount of students\u2019 credit balances. We believe that our higher education institution clients are and will be able to disclose this information without the students\u2019 or their parents\u2019 consent pursuant to one or more exceptions under FERPA. However, if ED asserts that we do not fall into one of these exceptions or if future changes to legislation or regulations require student consent before our higher education institution clients can disclose this information, a sizable number of students may cease using our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as we are indirectly subject to FERPA, we cannot permit the transfer of any personally identifiable information to another party other than in a manner in which a higher education institution may disclose it. In the event that we re-disclose student information in violation of this requirement, FERPA requires our clients to suspend our access to any such information for a period of five years. Any such suspension could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also are and will be subject to certain other federal rules regarding safeguarding personal information, including rules implementing the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or GLBA State Laws. We may also become subject to similar state laws and regulations, including those that restrict higher education institutions from disclosing certain personally identifiable information of students. State attorneys general and other enforcement agencies may monitor our compliance with state and federal laws and regulations that affect our business, including those pertaining to higher education and banking, and conduct investigations of our business that are time consuming and expensive and could result in fines and penalties that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, individual state legislatures may propose and enact new laws that will restrict or otherwise affect our ability to offer our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, regulations related to higher education change frequently, and new or additional regulations in the future may increase compliance costs, limit our business and prospects and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, increased regulatory requirements on our businesses may increase costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we do not devote sufficient resources to additional compliance personnel and systems commensurate with our anticipated growth, we could be subject to fines, regulatory scrutiny or adverse public reception to our products and services.\nOur management team has limited experience in managing a public company and the business and financing activities of an organization of our size, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur management team has had limited public company management experience or responsibilities, and has limited experience managing a business and related financing activities of our size. This could impair our ability to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements, such as public company compliance and filing required reports and other required information on a timely basis. It may be expensive to develop, implement and maintain programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting obligations imposed by such laws and regulations, and we may not have the resources to do so. Any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business.\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to internal software development; this capitalized asset could become impaired if there are changes in our business model that impact the expected use of that software.\nAt December 31, 2021, our net carrying value of developed software was $28.6 million, which made up a significant portion of our consolidated assets. This amount reflects the capitalized cost, net of accumulated amortization, of software that we developed internally as well as the remaining value of the acquired Higher One Disbursement business developed software. Changes in technology, our internal processes, or our business strategies or those of our partners could impact our ability to realize the value of our developed software, which could result in a write-down of the asset.", "PERMNO": 18086, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "MFAC"}
