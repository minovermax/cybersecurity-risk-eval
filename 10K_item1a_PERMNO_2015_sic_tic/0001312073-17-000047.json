{"cik": "1312073", "company": "VERIFONE SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below include risks related to our business, including operations, market, economic and political conditions, our legal and regulatory environment and our capital structure, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to the risks set forth below and the factors affecting specific business operations identified with the description of these operations elsewhere in this report, there may also be risks of which we are currently not aware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based on the information available to us, that later prove to be or become material.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not continually enhance our existing solutions and develop and market comprehensive new solutions and services responsive to technological advancements and customer or end user demand in a timely manner or at all, our net revenues and income will be adversely affected.\nThe market for electronic payment systems is characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapid technological advancements;\n\u2022\nfrequent product introductions and enhancements;\n\u2022\nlocal certification requirements and product customizations;\n\u2022\nevolving industry and government performance and security standards and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nintroductions of competitive products, including products that customers may perceive as having better functions and features, and alternative payment solutions, such as mobile payments and processing and digital services, at the POS; and\n\u2022\nrapidly changing customer and end user preferences or requirements.\nIn addition, our competitors have been increasingly aggressive in introducing products and lowering prices. Because of these factors, we must continually enhance our existing solutions and develop and market new solutions, and we must anticipate and respond timely to these industry, customer and regulatory changes in order to remain competitive, all of which have become increasingly challenging as competition intensifies. If we cannot develop new solutions or enhancements to our existing solutions that satisfy customer or end user demand, or if our new solutions or enhancements do not meet local certification requirements or we experience delays in the certification process or meet resistance from clients or merchants or are inhibited by third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, we will not be able to timely and adequately respond to competitive challenges and technological advancements, and our net revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. These efforts require management attention and significant investment in research and development as well as increased costs of manufacturing and distributing our systems, and ultimately may not be successful. We may not necessarily be able to increase or maintain prices to account for these costs, which will negatively impact our profitability, cash flows and results of operations. Our business has been in the past, continues to, and may in the future be adversely affected by our failure to timely obtain local certifications or develop software in some markets for certain of our products. In particular, our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to timely obtain certifications or develop software, including for our recently introduced Verifone Engage or Carbon lines of products.\nWe cannot be sure that we will successfully and timely complete the development, delivery and introduction of new solutions or enhancements or that our new solutions will satisfy customer or end user demand or be accepted in the marketplace. If we fail, we may lose market share to existing or new competitors and competing technologies, our solutions could become obsolete and our net revenues, income and profitability will suffer.\nWe continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition from existing and new competitors and a variety of technologies.\nThe markets for our systems and services are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and we have been and expect to continue to be subject to significant and increasing competition from existing and new competitors and a variety of technologies. Traditionally, we have competed with other large manufacturers and distributors of electronic point of sale payment solutions, suppliers of cash registers that provide built-in electronic payment capabilities and producers of software that facilitates electronic payment over the Internet. In certain areas, we also compete with smaller companies that have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases. We compete with companies that are more established, benefit from greater name recognition in particular countries, and have greater resources within those countries than we do. In addition, some of these competitors compete with aggressive pricing. At the same time, we also compete with new and emerging companies that are disrupting traditional markets and sectors. For example, as ridesharing companies and other taxi alternative companies expand and gain market share, the market for our taxi products could be negatively impacted. Failure to anticipate, adapt or keep pace with new technologies could harm our business and impact our future growth. For example, new technologies such as crypto-currencies and distributed ledgers and new authentication technologies (such as biometrics) may result in the introduction of new services and products, and it may be difficult to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, how these technologies may be regulated, and how they will impact our offerings and business.\nWe face downward pressures on prices in many emerging markets, including high growth emerging markets. For example, price competition is typically intense for us in countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia from both global and local competitors. In addition, pricing is increasingly an important factor in our ability to penetrate new markets. Any decrease in our selling prices in order to become and remain competitive in these markets could negatively impact our net revenues, gross margins and results of operations.\nWe also face competition from alternative payment solutions, such as mobile device-based card payment and processing solutions that offer customers the ability to pay on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods. Some of these alternative solutions enable payment and processing at the point of sale without use of traditional payment terminals, such as those we manufacture and sell. In addition, some of these alternative solutions are offered by companies that are significantly larger than we are. Competition from these alternative solutions, particularly as they are deployed globally could reduce demand for our traditional payment terminals and our services offerings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs discussed in \u201cIf we are unsuccessful in executing on our implementation of payment-related services offerings in new markets and obtaining and maintaining customer acceptance of our service offerings, our net revenues, income and profitability will be adversely affected\u201d, the competitive environment for services offerings is complex and very different in each market and, in some markets, our competitors include certain of our customers that distribute our terminals. Some of our competitors may offer more services, have better name recognition in that market or have a longer or more established relationship with customers in that market than we do. Some of our competitors also control other products and services that are important to our success, including platforms required for our planned expansion of payment-related services, or may acquire or develop exclusive strategic relationships with key distributors upon whom we previously relied.\nWe expect to continue to experience significant and increasing competition. Our net revenues, income and profitability will be negatively impacted if we do not effectively compete with existing competitors and new market entrants. If we cannot develop and offer, in a timely and cost-effective manner, technological features our customers desire or offer alternative solutions that align with shifts to payment on devices other than the traditional point of sale terminal, we may lose customers and market share, experience price reductions and/or reduced margins, or, in some cases, cease to participate in the market at all. Furthermore, as we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, product offering or service decisions or acquisitions that may lead to dissatisfaction among our customers and partners and harm our revenues and/or profitability.\nSecurity is vital to our customers and end users, and breaches in the security of our solutions could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that makes us a target of cyber- attacks on our systems and payment solutions. Our business involves the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary data or personally-identifying information of our customers, business partners and employees, as well as, in certain cases, end-users of our products or services. We rely on electronic networks, computers, systems, including our gateways, programs to run our business and operations, our employees and third party technology and IT infrastructure providers and, as a result, are potentially exposed to the risk of security breaches, computer or other malware, viruses, social engineering or general hacking, industrial espionage, employee or third party error or malfeasance, or other irregularities or compromises on our systems or those of third parties which could result in the loss or misappropriation of sensitive data, corruption of business data or other disruption to our operations. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, business partners, service providers and other users of our solutions to disclose information in order to gain access to sensitive data and our solutions. As we expand our solutions and services and handle increasing volumes and types of sensitive data, we may increasingly become a target of security breach attempts. We have devoted significant resources to security measures, processes and technologies to protect and secure our networks and systems, but they may not be sufficient to protect against threats to our systems and solutions.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to disable or degrade, electronic networks, computers, systems and solutions are rapidly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. An increasing number of companies have disclosed security breaches of their IT systems and networks, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. We believe such incidents are likely to continue, and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business. The techniques used to breach security safeguards evolve rapidly, and they may be difficult to detect for an extended period of time or until launched against a target. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined for some time. Security threats may also be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, potentially making them even more difficult to detect. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, as these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to enhance our security measures, processes and technologies and to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, cybercrime hackers have specifically targeted point-of-sale credit card payment systems. Overall payment network security depends upon a number of factors outside our control, including the merchant or service provider network environment in which our systems are installed, the merchant's or service provider's adherence to security protocols in the installation, use and operation of our solutions and implementation of and adherence to compliant security processes and practices for its network. Even if there is no compromise to our solutions, any security breach or compromise in any part of a merchant's or service provider's network could result in negative media and/or reputational harm to us, or other costs or damages to us, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have in the past experienced and may in the future experience security breaches related to unauthorized access to sensitive customer information. If the security of our solutions is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected, which would cause our business to suffer. We may also be subject to damages claims, lost sales, fines, investigations or lawsuits, which could lead to restrictions imposed on our business and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Also, any reputational damage resulting from a data security breach or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, we may also be subject to specific obligations relating to payment card data. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, we could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if we were to fail to follow payment card industry data security standards. In addition, if we do fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, our ability to market and sell our solutions could suffer, which could materially adversely affect our reputation,financial condition and operating results. The costs associated with preventing breaches in the security of our solutions, such as investment in technology and related personnel and costs associated with the testing and verification of the security of our solutions, could also adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of the data security risks to which we are exposed, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, and may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nWe expect our net revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. As a consequence, our operating results in any single quarter may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our stock to decline. Factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe type, timing, and size of orders and shipments;\n\u2022\ndelays in the implementation, including obtaining certifications, delivery and customer acceptance of our products and services, which may impact the timing of our recognition, and amount, of net revenues;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchases in anticipation of product or service enhancements or due to uncertainty in economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndemand for and acceptance of our new offerings;\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive conditions, including from traditional payment solution providers and from alternative payment solution providers;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we transition customers to our services model;\n\u2022\ntiming of or completion of divestitures;\n\u2022\ndecisions by our distributors and other customers relating to the overall channel inventories of our products held in a particular quarter;\n\u2022\nexcess inventory;\n\u2022\nconcentration in certain of our customer bases;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or market conditions, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nvariations in product and service mix and cost during any period;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new customer and distributor relationships or new types of customers, penetration of new markets and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers, distributors and strategic partners, as well as the mix of customers in a particular quarter;\n\u2022\ncomponent supply, manufacturing, or distribution difficulties;\n\u2022\ntiming of commencement, execution, or completion of major product or service implementation projects;\n\u2022\ntiming of governmental, statutory and industry association requirements, such as PCI compliance deadlines, EMV liability deadline extensions, or the pace of EMV adoption in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe introduction, modification or termination of government initiatives relating to cashless payments;\n\u2022\nthe relative geographic mix of net revenues;\n\u2022\nthe fixed nature of many of our expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing, effectiveness and efficiency of our restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in credit card interchange and assessment fees, which are set by the credit card networks and are a component of the cost of providing some of our product offerings, including transaction payment services and in-taxi payments solutions;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new or stricter laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, such as data protection and privacy laws and regulations, laws and regulations covering hazardous substances, or employment laws and regulations, that may cause us to incur additional compliance or implementation costs and/or costs to alter our business operations;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new laws and regulations, or changes in implementation of existing laws and regulations, in jurisdictions where we operate that may create uncertainty regarding the business operations of our customers or distributors, which may in turn lead to deferred or reduced orders from our customers or distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest, such as the ongoing significant civil, political and economic disturbances in Russia, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine and their spillover effect on surrounding areas as well as the political and military conditions in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nNo single factor above is dominant, and any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, we have experienced in the past and may continue to experience periodic variations in sales in our key vertical and geographical markets. In particular, differences in relative growth rates among our businesses in the U.S. and other regions may cause significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results, especially our quarterly gross profit margins, because net revenues generated from emerging markets tend to carry lower margins. Furthermore, revenue increases due to the adoption of standards such as EMV in the United States have in the past slowed and declined and may in the future slow or decline or not be sustained. In addition, the pace of EMV adoption in the U.S. will impact our revenues and operating results. In Latin America and some other markets, continued overall economic weakness and the contraction of certain economies in the region could cause our revenues to decline as customers delay or reduce orders. These periodic variations occur throughout the year and may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results depending on the impact of any given market during that quarter and could lead to volatility in our stock price.\nWe may suffer losses due to fraudulent activities.\nWe are expanding our service solutions offerings. Some of our service solutions offerings include our gateway services for credit card transactions. We may be subject to losses in the provision of such services in the event of fraudulent activities or errors in connection with such transactions. As we expand such service solutions offerings, we may increasingly become a target of fraudulent activities and our exposure to the risk of losses from such activities may increase, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the occurrence of fraud perpetrated on our solutions may result in negative publicity and user sentiment which could harm our brand and reputation and impair our ability to retain or attract users of our solutions.\nA majority of our net revenues are generated outside the U.S.; accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the United States. A portion of the net revenues we receive from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, the Brazilian real, the British Pound and the Swedish Krona. Additionally, portions of our cost of net revenues and our other operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies, primarily the Euro, the Brazilian real, the British Pound, and the Swedish Krona. Fluctuations in the value of these net revenues, costs and expenses as measured in U.S. dollars have historically affected our results of operations, and adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact in the future. Further, changes in exchange rates that strengthen the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our U.S. dollar-denominated products in the local currencies of the foreign markets we serve, making our products relatively more expensive than products that are denominated in local currencies, which could lead to a reduction in our sales and profitability in those markets. In recent periods, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in some cases significantly, against certain major currencies in which we transact, such as the Euro, the Brazilian real, and the Argentina Peso, impacting negatively our results of operations. Additionally, the 2016 referendum vote in the U.K. to exit the European Union, commonly known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d caused significant short term volatility in global stock markets as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations, resulting in further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, including against the British Pound. In addition, our balance sheet contains monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, such as cash, intercompany balances, trade receivables and payables, and fluctuations in the exchange rates for these currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to hedge a portion of our balance sheet exposure to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates. These hedging arrangements can be costly and may not always be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. In addition, we may be unable to hedge currency risk for some transactions due to cost or because of a high level of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our foreign exchange exposures. For some currencies in which we do business, hedging instruments may not be available on any terms.\nWe have also effectively priced our systems and services solutions in U.S. dollars in certain countries. Additionally, our efforts to effectively price products in U.S. dollars may have disadvantages as they may affect demand for our products if the local currency strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar. We could be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the local currency between the time of a sale and the time we receive payment, which would be collected in the devalued local currency. Accordingly, if there is an adverse movement in one or more exchange rates, we might suffer significant losses and our results of operations may otherwise be adversely affected. Uncertainty in global market conditions has resulted in and may continue to cause significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates which could increase these risks. As our international operations expand, our exposure to these risks also increases.\nWe intend to expand our operations internationally, and our results of operations could suffer if we are unable to manage our international expansion effectively.\nThe percentage of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. is significant and may increase over time. In particular, our acquisition of InterCard significantly increased our business in Germany and our acquisition of Panaroma is intended to increase our business in Turkey. Part of our strategy is to expand our penetration in existing foreign markets and to enter new foreign markets, particularly high growth emerging markets where we expect to see growth in electronic payments and related services. Our ability to penetrate some international markets may be limited due to different technical standards, protocols or product requirements. For example, we divested our controlling interest in the entity that operated our China business, in order to potentially enable the entity to better provide products and solutions that meet the requirements of the China market. Expansion of our international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources. Certain emerging markets, including those in the Middle East and Africa, may require longer lead times to develop distribution channels, may involve distribution channels with greater business and operational risk due to their relatively shorter operating histories, may be dependent upon the timing and success of local electronic payments initiatives and related infrastructure investments in such markets, as well as require additional time and effort to obtain product certifications and gain market acceptance for our products. Our international net revenues will depend on our success in a number of areas, including:\n\u2022\nsecuring commercial relationships to help establish or increase our presence in new and existing international markets;\n\u2022\nhiring and training personnel capable of marketing, installing and integrating our solutions, supporting customers, and effectively managing operations in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nadapting our solutions to meet local requirements and regulations, and to target the specific needs and preferences of foreign customers, which may differ from our traditional customer base in the markets we currently serve;\n\u2022\nbuilding our brand name and awareness of our services in new and existing international markets;\n\u2022\nenhancing our business infrastructure to enable us to efficiently manage the higher costs of operating across a larger span of geographic regions and international jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nimplementing effective systems, procedures, and controls to monitor and manage our operations across our international markets.\nAs discussed more extensively under \u201cIf we fail to address the challenges and risks associated with international operations, including those through expansion and acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties implementing our strategy, which could impede our growth or harm our operating results\u201d, if we cannot effectively manage our international expansion, our results of operations could suffer.\nIf we fail to address the challenges and risks associated with international operations, including those through expansion and acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties implementing our strategy, which could impede our growth or harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks and costs associated with operating in foreign countries which could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if we are not able to effectively manage these risks, our strategy of international expansion will be negatively impacted.\nOur international operations expose us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlocal regulatory or industry imposed requirements, including security or other certification requirements;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing market participants, including strong global or local competitors that may have a longer history in and greater familiarity with the international markets we enter;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, including the imposition of new or enforcement of existing import restrictions in jurisdictions in which we do business;\n\u2022\nhigher costs and complexities of compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations such as import and trade regulations and embargoes, boycotts, trade agreements, trade sanctions, export requirements and local tax laws;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices that may favor local competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade relations and trade policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including implementation of or changes to trade sanctions, tariffs and embargoes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds, including remittance of dividends by foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency exchange restrictions, and currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\npricing sensitivities, less favorable payment terms and increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and developing payment histories that support collectability of accounts receivable and revenue recognition;\n\u2022\ndifferent and/or more stringent labor laws and practices, such as the mandated use of workers' councils and labor unions, or laws that provide for broader definitions of employer/employee relationships;\n\u2022\ndifferent and/or more stringent data protection, privacy and other laws;\n\u2022\nthe introduction, modification or termination of government initiatives relating to cashless payments;\n\u2022\nantitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure challenges;\n\u2022\nsupply chain challenges and product delivery delays;\n\u2022\nchanges or instability in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property, including in areas such as China, India, Russia, and Latin America.\nMany of these factors typically become more prevalent during periods of economic stress, such as the ongoing weakness in the economies of the euro zone countries and Latin America countries and volatility in global financial markets, or disruptive events such as natural or man-made disasters or military or terrorist actions. The occurrence or persistence of weakened global economic conditions in one or more regions where we do business may exacerbate certain of these risks. Additionally, these risks and costs associated with operating in foreign countries are heightened with respect to our international expansion into emerging or developing markets, which, for example, tend to experience more economic and political instability or have less developed or sophisticated distribution channels.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk including that from economic and political instability which can lead to significant and unpredictable volatility in currency rates, including as a result of significant currency devaluations, which may negatively impact our net revenues, gross margins, results of operations and financial position. Although we engage in some hedging of our foreign currency exposures, we do not hedge all such exposures and our hedging arrangements may not always be effective. The uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations, related European financial restructuring efforts and the eventual exit of the U.K. from the European Union as a result of the Brexit referendum may cause the value of the Euro and the British pound to decline. The current political situation in Ukraine, the sanctions imposed against Russia by certain European nations and the U.S., Russia's response to these sanctions, and any changes in U.S. policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election may further increase the economic uncertainty in the affected regions and lead to further fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies, such as the Euro and Russian ruble, used in these regions. Similarly, an economic downturn in China or a further decrease in economic growth in China could lead to currency fluctuations that impact us. See \u201cA majority of our net revenues are generated outside the U.S.; accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations\u201d and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk--Foreign Currency Transaction Risk in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.\nIn addition, compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including changes and additions to such laws and regulations, that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. Our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, trade restrictions and embargoes, exchange control regulations, data privacy requirements, labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and other improper payments or inducements, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, distributors, suppliers and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions, including acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with U.S. and other laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours. For example, as described under the caption \u201cDisclosures of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u201d in Part I, Item 1, Business, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, in early 2013, we submitted a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in connection with certain unauthorized activities by employees of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that involved potential violations of sanctions regulations. Any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts and our business, and negatively impact our operating results.\nOur international operations tend to carry solutions with lower average selling prices, may be subject to greater downward pressure on prices in some markets and may be associated with higher costs and lower gross margins, which may promote volatility in our results of operations and may adversely impact future growth in our earnings.\nOur international sales of systems tend to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than our sales in the United States. We also face downward pressure on prices in certain international markets such as Southeast Asia, where competition from local low-cost and global competitors has intensified, Brazil, where competition has intensified, and India where we continue to work to expand our business. In these and certain other markets, some customers increasingly seek lower-cost solutions suited to their markets that may have similar, different, and in some cases, better features and functionality. In addition, the costs associated with international trade may be higher as a result of the importation costs, duties and trade requirements or other import or export control laws and regulations imposed by some jurisdictions where we do business. As a result, any improvement in our results of operations from our international expansion will likely not be as favorable or profitable as an expansion of similar magnitude in the United States. In addition, if we are unable to accurately predict for any future period our proportion of net revenues that will result from international sales versus sales in the U.S., variations from period to period may lead to volatility in our results of operations and may adversely impact future growth in our earnings.\nMacroeconomic conditions and economic volatility have in the past and could in future periods materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. For example, the current continued and prolonged weak macro-economic conditions in Europe and in some euro zone countries have resulted in a slowdown, and in some cases deferrals, of orders by customers, which has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the significant slowdown and volatility in the U.S. and international economy and financial markets which began in the latter half of 2008 resulted in reduced demand for our products and adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lower-than-expected growth rates in certain emerging market economies in which we operate have also had an adverse effect on our results of operations in these regions. More recently, the volatility in oil prices has resulted in, and may continue to result in, decline in demand and overall weaker market conditions in countries and regions heavily dependent on oil revenues, such as Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, and the Middle East. In particular, the slowdown and volatility in the global markets resulted in softer demand in the financial and retail sectors, pricing pressures and more conservative purchasing decisions by customers, including a tendency toward lower-priced products and lower volume of purchases. In some countries where we do business, the weakened economy has resulted in economic instability which has had negative effects, including a decrease in purchasing power due to currency devaluations. If these weak macro-economic conditions continue or if any economic recovery remains slow and fragile or is not sustained, our net revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe expect certain markets where we conduct business, including parts of Europe and Latin America, to continue to experience weakened or uncertain economic conditions in the near term, and some of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and partners will continue to be negatively impacted by the continued global weakness in the economy. We cannot predict the extent and duration of the negative impact that global and regional economic volatility may have on our business, operating results and financial condition. There is no assurance that governments and central banks will take actions to further stimulate the economy or that any such actions will have positive or lasting impacts. Existing stimulus measures may also be withdrawn or reduced, introducing greater economic uncertainty or volatility. Further, conditions such as political situations or terrorist actions in other parts of the world, such as Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific, the continued uncertainty related to economic conditions in the U.S., any potential, additional congressional actions regarding the national debt ceiling and federal budget deficit, changes to the federal income tax code and related policies, the potential effect of any future federal government shutdown, and additional costs related to changes in or repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as well as high unemployment rates in certain regions, may negatively impact global economic conditions, including corporate and consumer spending, and liquidity of capital markets. Continued volatility in market conditions, such as fluctuations in foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar, make it difficult to forecast our financial guidance and/or to meet such guidance. If we fail to meet our financial guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any period, the market price of our stock could decline.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit from the European Union could adversely impact us.\nOn June 23, 2016, in a referendum vote commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d a majority of British voters voted to exit the European Union. In March 2017, the U.K. government officially triggered the process to formally initiate negotiations for the terms of separation from the European Union. In June 2017, the U.K. government began negotiations to leave the European Union. A withdrawal could potentially disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Because this is an unprecedented event, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect our business globally and in the region. In addition, Brexit may lead other European Union member countries to consider referendums regarding their European Union membership. Any of these events, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm our business and financial results.\nSanctions against Russia, and Russia's response to those sanctions, including the imposition of sanctions by Russia, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2014, the Crimean region of Ukraine was annexed by Russia. In response, other nations, including the U.S., have imposed or are considering imposing, economic sanctions on Russia. Recently, concerns related to the political and military conditions in the region have prompted stringent restrictions by the U.S. and European Union, and increasing levels of economic sanctions, targeting certain Russian companies in the finance, energy and defense industries and additional Russian nationals, as well as imposing restrictions on trading and access to capital markets. In response, Russia announced its own trading sanctions against nations that implemented or supported the anti-Russia sanctions, including the U.S. and some European Union nations. Russia has also announced potential sanctions against Turkey in response to a military incident between Turkey and Russia in November 2015. A portion of our net revenues are from Russia and its surrounding areas, including Ukraine and Turkey. Economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, Russia, Turkey or the world community may result in serious economic challenges in Ukraine, Turkey, Russia and the surrounding areas, and imposition of trade restrictions may delay or prevent shipment of products to or services performed in those countries, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, to the extent it is more difficult for some of our customers to obtain financing or access U.S. dollar currency, due to restrictions on access to international capital markets as a result of the sanctions, our customers' ability to pay could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Further, current and any future retaliatory measures by Russia in response to anti-Russia sanctions could adversely affect European and Middle East economic conditions, which could in turn affect our business in Europe, Turkey and elsewhere. Accordingly, sanctions against or by Russia and the responses to sanctions, including potential responses by Turkey to sanctions imposed by Russia, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Further, it is unclear whether any changes in U.S. policy regarding sanctions against Russia will be forthcoming as a result of the new U.S. presidential administration and how those potential changes may impact the U.S., Russia and world economies and our business.\nOur solutions may have defects or experience field failures that could delay sales, harm our brand, increase costs and result in product recalls and additional warranty and other expense.\nWe offer complex solutions that are susceptible to undetected hardware and software errors or failures. Our solutions may experience failures when first introduced, as new versions or enhancements are released, or at any time during their lifecycle. Despite our testing procedures and controls over manufacturing quality, errors may be found in our products. Field failure may result from usage with third-party issued payment cards, for example, if such usage generates excess electrostatic discharge. Defects may also arise from third-party components that are incorporated into our products, such as hardware modules, chipsets, wireless modules or battery cells. Our customers may also run third-party software applications on our electronic payment systems. Errors in such third-party applications could adversely affect the performance of our solutions or cause the loss of data. Any product recalls or delays in implementation of our products as a result of, or perceived to be resulting from, our errors or failures could result in the loss of customers, fines incurred by our customers due to failure to comply with payment system rules for which we may be obligated to compensate our customers, loss of or delays in market acceptance of our solutions, diversion of the attention of our research and development personnel from product development efforts and harm to our credibility and relationships with our customers, adversely affect our business and reputation, and increase our product costs which could negatively impact our margins, profitability, and results of operations. Any significant returns or warranty claims for any of our products, including products from acquisitions, could result in significant additional costs to us, such as costs to implement modifications to correct defects, recall and replace products, and defend against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIdentifying and correcting defects can be time-consuming, costly and in some circumstances extremely difficult. It may take several months to correct software errors, and even longer for hardware defects. The delays in correcting product defects could exacerbate the adverse impact product defects or failures may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nDisruptions in our solutions could reduce our revenues, increase costs, harm our reputation, result in loss of customers and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur solutions may experience service interruptions, degradation or other failures because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer or other malware, viruses, social engineering, general hacking, or other events. Our solutions also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our solutions are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nDisruptions in our solutions may result in our customers' inability to process transactions using our terminals or gateways, lead to loss of revenues for us and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. We may have to spend resources to detect and fix defects that caused such disruptions, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to detect and fix all such defects. Moreover, to the extent that any disruption results in damages to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Our brand may be permanently harmed by disruptions in our solutions and we may lose customers to our competitors, which could result in financial or reputational harm to our business. Disruptions in our solutions may also cause potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to avoid our solutions.\nChanges to our management and strategic business plan and restructuring activities may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention, our stock price, our customer relationships, and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, changes in our management team. In 2013, the Board appointed Mr. Paul Galant as our CEO and Mr. Marc E. Rothman as our new CFO. Further, since Mr. Galant's appointment, we have announced certain other sales, technology, marketing, human resources, and operations management changes. During this time of transition, our new executive leadership and our continuing executives have been designing and implementing changes to our strategic business plans, in order to better position the company for strategic growth and long-term profitability. In addition, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in accordance with our approved restructuring plans, reducing the number of employees and contractors in certain areas and reassigning certain employee duties, and consolidating excess facilities. Our management changes, changes to our strategic business plan, and restructuring activities, as well as the potential for additional changes or activities in the future, may introduce uncertainty regarding our business prospects and may result in disruption of our business and our customer relationships. In addition, these changes and measures could distract our employees, decrease employee morale, result in failure in meeting operational targets due to the loss of employees and make it more difficult to retain and hire new talent, increase our expenses in terms of severance payments and facility exit costs, both of which could be significant, expose us to increased risk of legal claims by terminated employees, and harm our reputation. These changes and activities could also increase the volatility of our stock price. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully implement our transformation initiatives or fully realize the anticipated benefits from our restructuring efforts.\nWe are in the process of implementing a number of strategic, transformation initiatives intended to redefine our global product management process and portfolio, re-engineer our research and development function and improve our cost structure. As part of these transformation initiatives, during recent fiscal years our management approved restructuring plans to better align our business organization, operations and product lines to achieve long-term sustainable growth and value, including through workforce reduction and facility consolidations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our transformation initiatives. Further, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, including the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency, of such transformation initiatives and the restructuring plans within expected timeframes is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are, in turn, subject to significant economic, market, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Further restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future beyond what is currently planned, which could further enhance the risks associated with these activities. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement, or fully realize the anticipated positive impact of, our transformation initiatives and the restructuring plans or execute successfully on our transformation strategy, in the timeframes we desire or at all.\nIf we are unsuccessful in executing on our implementation of payment-related services offerings in new markets and obtaining and maintaining customer acceptance of our service offerings, our net revenues, income and profitability will be adversely affected.\nA central part of our strategic plan is to increase services offerings so that we can derive higher overall net revenues and margins, develop deeper relationships with our customers and drive more predictable financial results. Following our acquisition of Point, we have been implementing their payment-related services offerings in multiple jurisdictions. Implementing a new services model is difficult and involves management focus, upfront local infrastructure and capital costs and other resources that could otherwise be utilized in research and development of other hardware and software product offerings, and the build-out of local service and support teams. In addition, the competitive environment for services is very different in each market, and the bundle of services being offered must be customized to compete effectively. Markets may take longer to adopt a payment processing model than we anticipate or may choose not to adopt this model at all. We may also be competing against others, including certain of our customers that distribute our terminals, who already offer similar services. Continued weakness in the global economy may also negatively impact our ability to implement payment-related services offerings within the time frames we desire and to achieve the benefits we anticipate. If we are unsuccessful in executing on our implementation of payment-related services offerings and obtaining and maintaining customer acceptance of our service offerings or are unable to implement the model while also maintaining focus on other key areas of our business or if we are unable to maintain the expected level of margins associated with these service offerings, we may not be able to generate sufficient returns on our investments in the services business and our net revenues, income and profitability will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced growth in our operations in recent years, and if we cannot manage our expanded operations and also effectively execute on our business strategy, our results of operations will suffer.\nWe have experienced growth in our operations in recent years, both organically and from acquisitions. If we cannot manage our expanded operations to align with our business strategy, which includes maintaining streamlined and efficient operations while effectively meeting the needs of our broader customer base, managing a competitive portfolio of products, and growing our payment services globally in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations will suffer. In particular, we may not be able to attain desired cost-efficiencies and remain competitive, and any measures we may need to undertake to further align our operations with our business strategy may be costly and could adversely impact our results of operations. If we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy, our results of operations may also be adversely affected. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that we have made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with supporting our expanded operations. Any delay in implementing, or transitioning to, new or enhanced systems, procedures, processes or controls to adequately support our expanded operations, including our expansion into a number of additional international markets, including emerging markets, and our growth in payment-related services globally may adversely affect our ability to meet customer requirements, manage our product inventory, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.\nFrom time to time, we engage in acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions that involve numerous enterprise risks and could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We may not be able to address these risks without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems, and may not realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we, from time to time, conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities, and complete acquisitions or strategic investments in related businesses, technologies, or products.\nThe integration of our acquisitions, particularly those that are international in scope, is complex, time-consuming and expensive, and has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business or divert the attention of our management. Achieving the expected benefits of our acquisitions depends in large part on our successful integration of the acquired businesses' operations and personnel with our own in a timely and efficient manner. We cannot ensure that all of our integration efforts will be completed as quickly as expected or that our past or future acquisitions will achieve any of the expected benefits. These challenges and risks, which are heightened due to the number, size and varying scope of our recently completed acquisitions, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate the operations, business systems, and personnel of the acquired business, technology or product, including coordinating the efforts of the sales operations, in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of managing acquired lines of business, particularly those lines of business with which we have limited operational experience;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of acquisitions, that are offered, priced or supported differently, potentially leading to integration delays and customer impact;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate or migrate the information technology infrastructures of acquired operations into our information technology systems and resources in an effective and timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe need to migrate our acquired businesses to our common enterprise resource planning information system and integrating all operations, sales, accounting, human resources and administrative activities for the combined company, all in a scalable, cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe need to coordinate research and development and support activities across our existing and newly acquired products and services in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe challenges of incorporating acquired technologies, products and service offerings into our next generation of products and solutions in an effective and timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business, including the diversion of management attention to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nin the case of international acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different jurisdictions, cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, foreign currency, political, legal, compliance and regulatory risks, including with respect to countries where we previously had limited operations;\n\u2022\nthe possible inability to realize the desired financial and strategic benefits from any or all of our acquisitions or investments in the time frame expected, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe loss of all or part of our investment;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain employees from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate each company's accounting, legal, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to enable effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or unsuccessful;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies and the potential stress on our existing controls, particularly in integrating multiple acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe risk that increasing complexity inherent in operating a larger global business and managing a broader range of solutions and service offerings may impact the effectiveness of our internal controls and adversely affect our financial reporting processes;\n\u2022\nthe failure to adequately identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company, which could result in unexpected litigation, unanticipated liabilities, additional costs, unfavorable accounting treatment or other adverse effects; and\n\u2022\nthe dependency on the retention and performance of key management and employees of acquired businesses for the day-to-day management and future operating results of these businesses.\nOur operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by pre-existing claims or liabilities, both known and unknown, of these acquired companies, including claims from current or former customers, terminated employees or other third parties; pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that may contain unfavorable terms or that have unfavorable revenue recognition or accounting treatment; and intellectual property claims or disputes. We similarly may be subject to continuing liability associated with businesses that we have disposed of. In addition, the integration process may strain the combined company's financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures and may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the combined company's core business objectives. There can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate our businesses or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions after we complete our integration efforts. If we are not successful in our integration efforts and cannot realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, we may incur substantial eventual additional expenses and expend resources in connection with divestitures of non-performing businesses.\nThese risks are heightened and more prevalent in acquisitions of larger businesses, in the event of multiple concurrent acquisitions and integrations, or in businesses involving geographies or business lines in which we may have less experience. Future acquisitions and investments could also result in substantial cash expenditures, potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities and incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract, integrate, manage, and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key senior management, engineering, sales and marketing, supply chain, and other specialized personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to attract, integrate, manage, and retain highly skilled employees throughout our business. Competition for some of these personnel is intense in certain markets, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and competitive pressures in such markets can drive up wages, impacting our profitability. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy, including as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. In the past we have had difficulty hiring, in our desired time frame and in our desired markets, employees that have the specific qualifications required for a particular position. In particular, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining personnel as a result of the workforce reduction measures we have implemented or may implement in the future. To help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards, such as employee stock options and restricted stock units as well as cash-based incentive awards tied to our performance. If the Company's overall performance is poor, the value of our stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, employee incentive awards and morale could be negatively impacted and our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as timely product introductions, and our business and profitability may suffer.\nWe depend on distributors and resellers to sell a significant portion of our solutions. If we do not effectively manage our relationships with them, our net revenues and results of operations could suffer.\nWe sell a significant portion of our solutions through third-party resellers such as independent distributors, ISOs, value-added resellers, and payment processors. We depend on their active marketing and sales efforts. These resellers also provide after-sales support and related services to end user customers, and generally have valuable knowledge and experience with the customer base in the territories they serve. These resellers also provide critical services of developing and supporting the software applications to run on our various electronic payment systems and, internationally, in obtaining requisite certifications in the markets in which they are active. Accordingly, the pace at which we are able to introduce new solutions in markets in which these resellers are active depends in part on the resources they dedicate to these tasks. Moreover, our arrangements with these resellers typically do not prevent them from selling products of other companies, including our competitors, and such resellers may elect to market our competitors' products and services in preference to our system solutions. In addition, we may offer similar services as those offered by certain of our resellers as we introduce payment-related services offerings in new markets. If one or more of our major resellers terminate their relationship with us, are acquired by one of our competitors or one of our competitor's resellers, or otherwise adversely change their relationship with us, we may be unsuccessful in replacing such relationship. The loss of any of our major resellers could impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in lower net revenues and income. It could also be time-consuming and expensive to replicate, either directly or through other resellers, the certifications and the applications developed by these resellers.\nIn addition, orders from our distributors and resellers depend on their sales volumes and inventory management decisions. We have experienced, and may in future periods experience, a significant decrease in our net revenues based on the timing of orders from our distributors, which generally varies based on distributor decisions on managing inventory levels, desired product mix and timing of new product introductions. Declines or deferrals of orders could materially and adversely affect our net revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers, including distributors and resellers, for a large percentage of our net revenues. If we do not effectively manage our relationships with them, our net revenues and operating results could suffer.\nA significant percentage of our net revenues is attributable to a limited number of customers, including distributors and ISOs. If we are not able to adequately and timely respond to demands for new or additional products or features from any of our large customers, that customer may decide to reduce its order or not to purchase from us at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our net revenues are dependent in part on the timing of purchases by our large customers. If any of our large customers significantly reduces or delays purchases from us or if we are required to sell products to them at reduced prices or on other terms less favorable to us, our net revenues, profitability, cash flows and net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nTiming for orders for our products and services can be back-end weighted within the fiscal quarter, which can make our net revenues difficult to predict and can negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nThe timing of our customer orders and related net revenues are often back-end weighted, meaning that during a particular fiscal quarter, a substantial portion of sales orders may be received, substantial product may be shipped, and substantial revenue may be recognized in the last month of the fiscal quarter. Timing of customer orders and related net revenues often become more back-end weighted during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty, as well as in markets where there is uncertainty related to acceptance and/or implementation of our products, such as that related to changes or potential changes in regulations or other local requirements that impact deployment of our products. These effects can also be exacerbated in markets where we depend on a limited number of customers, and where one or a few customers' decisions can have a significant impact on our results of operations in the fiscal quarter. Such back-end loading can also adversely affect our business and results of operations due to a number of additional factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing processes at our third-party contract manufacturers could become concentrated in a shorter time period. This concentration of manufacturing could increase manufacturing costs, such as costs associated with the expediting of orders, and negatively impact our gross margins. The risk of higher levels of obsolete or excess inventory write-offs would also increase if we were to hold higher inventory levels to counteract this effect;\n\u2022\nthe higher concentration of orders may make it difficult to accurately forecast component requirements and, as a result, we could experience a shortage of the components needed for production, possibly delaying shipments and causing lost orders;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to fill orders at the end of a quarter, shipments may be delayed. This could cause us to fail to meet our revenue and operating profit expectations for a particular quarter and could increase the fluctuation of quarterly results if shipments are delayed from one fiscal quarter to the next or orders are canceled by customers; and\n\u2022\nin order to fulfill orders at the end of a quarter, we may be forced to deliver our products using air freight which would result in increased distribution costs.\nThese factors can cause our net revenues to fluctuate and be difficult to predict in any given fiscal quarter. Any failure to meet our or analysts' revenue or operating profit expectations for a particular quarter could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIf we do not accurately forecast customer demand and effectively manage our product mix and inventory levels, we may lose sales from having too few or the wrong mix of products or incur costs associated with excess inventory.\nIf we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we could end up with either excess or insufficient inventory to satisfy demand. This problem is exacerbated because our products are offered in a number of different configurations and with a variety of optional features, and we generally receive a significant volume of customer orders towards the end of each fiscal quarter which leaves us little room to adjust inventory mix to match demand, as discussed under \u201cTiming for orders for our products and services can be back-end weighted within the fiscal quarter, which can make our net revenues difficult to predict and can negatively impact our business and results of operations.\u201d During the transition from an existing product to a new replacement product, we must accurately predict the demand for the existing and the new product. Furthermore, introducing new products into our current markets or existing products into new markets involves the uncertainty of whether the market will adopt our product in the volumes and time frames that we anticipate or at all. Our inability to properly manage our inventory levels could lead to increased expenses associated with writing off excessive or obsolete inventory, additional shipping costs to meet immediate demand and a corresponding decline in gross margins, or lost sales. If we do not accurately predict demand, we could also incur increased expenses associated with binding commitments to certain third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. For example, as of October 31, 2017, the amount of purchase commitments issued to contract manufacturers and component suppliers totaled approximately $113.5 million. Of this amount, $8.3 million was recorded in Accruals and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because these commitments were not expected to have future value to us. On April 3, 2017, to lock in pricing on certain components, we committed to purchase $144 million of such components over a four year period, $36 million per year, from one of our existing suppliers. As of October 31, 2017, our remaining non-cancelable commitment under this agreement totaled $103.9 million.\nFor additional information regarding our commitments to third-party manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, such as the global economic recession that continues to impact certain parts of Europe, it becomes more difficult to accurately forecast demand and manage our inventory levels. Deteriorating market conditions have in the past and can in future periods cause us to incur additional costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory, scrap, and excess inventory held by our contract manufacturers.\nWe may accumulate excess or obsolete inventory that could result in unanticipated price reductions and write-downs and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn formulating our solutions, we have focused our efforts on providing our customers with solutions that have high levels of functionality, which requires us to develop and incorporate new and evolving technologies. This approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products and components we hold in inventory and may compound the difficulties posed by other factors that affect our inventory levels, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaintaining significant inventory of components that are in limited supply;\n\u2022\nbuying components in bulk for better pricing;\n\u2022\nentering into purchase commitments based on early estimates of quantities for longer lead time components;\n\u2022\nresponding to the unpredictable demand for products;\n\u2022\ncancellation of customer orders;\n\u2022\nresponding to customer requests for quick delivery schedules; and\n\u2022\ntiming of end-of-life decisions regarding products.\nThe accumulation of excess or obsolete inventory has in the past resulted in and may in future periods result in price reductions and inventory write-downs and scrap, which could, sometimes materially, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to credit risk with some of our customers and to credit exposures and currency controls in certain markets, which could result in material losses.\nA significant portion of our net revenues are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of up to 60 days in the U.S. and longer in some international markets due to local customs or conditions. In the past, there have been bankruptcies among our customer base. Credit risks may be higher and collections may be more difficult to enforce in emerging markets where we conduct business, including for example where the market for our products and solutions is still developing and their acceptance uncertain, and future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Also, certain customers that are invoiced in U.S. dollars, such as those based in Venezuela and Nigeria and other countries whose economies are significantly impacted by the price of oil, have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in obtaining U.S. dollars due to local currency controls, and therefore may not be able to remit timely payment to us. Additionally, instability or uncertainty in global or regional economic, political or military conditions may make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing or access U.S. dollar currency, and their ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon third parties to manufacture our systems and to supply the components necessary to manufacture our products, and in some cases we are dependent upon sole source suppliers to manufacture our systems.\nWe utilize a limited number of third parties to manufacture our hardware products pursuant to our specifications and rely upon these contract manufacturers to produce and deliver products on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost or to otherwise meet our product demands. Further, a material portion of these third-party manufacturing activities are concentrated in China. Disruptions to the business, financial stability or operations, including due to strikes, labor disputes or other disruptions to the workforce, of these contract manufacturers, or to their ability to produce the products we require in accordance with our and our customers' requirements, and particularly disruptions to the manufacturing operations in China including due to geological disruptions such as earthquakes, could significantly affect our ability to fulfill customer demand on a timely basis which could materially harm our net revenues and results of operations. Substantially all of our manufacturing is currently handled by our third-party contract manufacturers and our dependency on our third-party contract manufacturers could exacerbate these risks.\nComponents such as application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, microprocessors, wireless modules, modems, and printer mechanisms that are necessary to manufacture and assemble our systems are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers selected by us. Certain of the components are specifically customized for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis. Disruptions to the business, financial stability or operations, including due to strikes, labor disputes or other disruptions to the workforce, of our suppliers, and particularly sole source suppliers, or to the distribution and transportation of our products may also impact the availability of components to us in the quantities or within the timeframe we require. Any prolonged component shortage could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Component shortages have resulted in increased costs for certain components and continued cost increases due to shortages or other factors could negatively impact our gross margins and profitability. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the quantities that we require within the timeframe that we require, we would be faced with a shortage of components. We also experience from time to time an increase in the lead time for delivery of some of our key components. We may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner if suppliers of our key components become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of these key components when we need them or if they increase their prices. If we are unable to obtain sufficient key required components, or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future, or to replace our component and factory tooling for our products in a timely manner if they are damaged or destroyed, we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments. This could harm our relationships with our customers and cause our net revenues to decline. Even if we are able to secure alternative sources or replace our tooling in a timely manner, our costs could increase. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations.\nShipments of electronic payment systems may be delayed by factors outside of our control, which can harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers.\nThe shipment of payment systems requires us or our manufacturers, distributors, or other agents to obtain customs or other government certifications and approvals, and, on occasion, to submit to physical inspection of our systems in transit. Failure to satisfy these requirements, and the very process of trying to satisfy them, can lead to lengthy delays in the delivery of our solutions to our direct or indirect customers. Because we depend upon third-party carriers for the timely delivery of our products we may face delays in delivery due to reasons outside our control. Delays and unreliable delivery by us may harm our reputation in the industry and our relationships with our customers and result in canceled orders, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe may be subject to future impairment charges due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, particularly that of Lipman in November 2006, Hypercom in August 2011, Point in December 2011, as well as acquisitions related to our Taxi Solutions, we have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet. We test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis as required, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include a reduction in our stock price and market capitalization and changes in our estimated future cash flows or changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units or lines of business.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our organizational structure and changed our reportable segments to be Verifone Systems and Verifone Services. As a result of this change, we realigned our reporting units to be Verifone Systems, Taxi Solutions, and Verifone Services. During the second quarter of 2017, we concluded that the carrying amount of the goodwill related to our former Taxi Solutions reporting unit may not be recoverable. Based on a quantitative assessment, considering potential sales transactions, we concluded that the goodwill was impaired by $17.4 million. There were no indicators of impairment for our Verifone Systems and Verifone Services reporting units during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.\nOur evaluation of potential impairment of goodwill is subjective, requires significant judgment and could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including declines in our stock price, failure to meet our internal forecasts, and weakening of macroeconomic conditions or significant changes in management structure or business strategies. If we determine in the future that there is potential further impairment in any of our reporting units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and could also materially and adversely affect our business. See Note 10, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates -- Goodwill, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe have operations in Israel and therefore our results of operations may be adversely affected by political or economic instability or military operations in or around Israel.\nWe have offices and personnel in Israel. Therefore, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. The outcome of peace efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbors remains uncertain. Any armed conflicts, such as ongoing military conflict in the Gaza Strip, or further political instability in the region is likely to negatively affect business conditions and materially harm our results of operations. Furthermore, several countries continue to restrict or ban business with Israel, Israeli companies and companies with significant Israeli operations. These restrictive laws and policies may seriously limit our ability to make sales in those countries.\nIn addition, many employees in Israel are obligated to perform between 30 to 40 days of military reserve duty annually and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. If a military conflict arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. Our operations in Israel could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service. Any disruption in our operations in Israel could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe have operations and business in Turkey that may be adversely affected by political and economic instability in the country and military operations in the region.\nIn July 2016, there was an attempted military coup in Turkey. In the aftermath of the coup, some of our partners and customers delayed shipments and orders, impacting our revenues. While the current government was able to stay in power, the country continues to experience political turmoil and the Turkish government is operating under a state of emergency. This evolving situation could further negatively impact our results and business opportunities in the country, including our ability to market certain solutions in the region. For example, the Turkish government has delayed implementation of a fiscalization mandate to January 2018. This may further impact or delay our business opportunities and revenue expectations in the country for the next fiscal year.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war and political instability may adversely affect us.\nTerrorist attacks, war, and international political instability may impact our operations, our customers and otherwise disrupt our ability to generate net revenues. Such events may negatively affect our ability to maintain net revenues and to develop new business relationships. Because a substantial and growing part of our net revenues is derived from sales and services to customers outside of the U.S. and we have our electronic payment systems manufactured outside the U.S., terrorist attacks, war, and international political instability anywhere may decrease international demand for our products and inhibit customer development opportunities abroad, disrupt our supply chain, and impair our ability to deliver our electronic payment systems, which could materially and adversely affect our net revenues or results of operations. Economic and political instability, particularly in the Middle East or OPEC member countries, may also disrupt the production or supply of fuel which could increase our costs related to shipment and distribution of our products. Any of these events may also disrupt global financial markets and precipitate a decline in the price of our stock. See also \"Sanctions against Russia, and Russia's response to those sanctions, including the imposition of sanctions by Russia, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\", \"We have operations in Israel and therefore our results of operations may be adversely affected by political or economic instability or military operations in or around Israel\" and \"We have operations and business in Turkey that may be adversely affected by political and economic instability in the country and military operations in the region.\"\nNatural or man-made disasters, business interruptions and health epidemics could delay our ability to receive or ship our products or provide our services, or otherwise disrupt our business.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, health epidemics, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, all of which could impact our ability to conduct vital business operations, including the ability of our employees to access work sites or customer sites where urgent or time critical repairs are needed. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our business, our revenue and financial condition, and increase our costs and expenses. If our or our manufacturers' facilities are damaged or destroyed, we would be unable to distribute our products or provide our services on a timely basis, which could harm our business. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults. Certain key servers and information systems as well as a shared services center are located in Florida, which has in the past experienced major hurricanes and similar extreme weather. Any disruption of our operations in these areas could materially affect our operations and harm our business. In addition, we increasingly rely on our computer systems and servers to conduct our business. For example, much of our order fulfillment process is automated and the order information is stored on our servers. If our computer systems and servers are impaired or cease functioning, even for a short period, our ability to serve our customers and fulfill orders would be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and our net revenues could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, if our computer information systems or communication systems, or those of our vendors or customers, are subject to hacker attacks or other disruptions, our business could suffer. Although we have established and tested back-up systems and facilities to run our critical business operations in case of a business interruption, some of our systems and facilities are not yet fully redundant or fully tested. We are still in the process of finalizing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan and continue to rely on regional disaster recovery plans in some cases. In addition, our back-up operations may be inadequate under certain circumstances and our business interruption insurance may not be enough to compensate us for any losses that we may incur, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as harm our reputation, and could cause our stock price to decline significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur results of operations will suffer if we cannot comply with industry and government regulations and standards, or if changing standards do not continue to drive upgrade cycles.\nOur systems must meet industry standards imposed by payment systems standards setting organizations such as EMVCo LLC, credit card associations such as Visa, MasterCard, and other credit card associations and standard setting organizations such as PCI SSC, Intermec and the U.K. Cards Association and other local organizations. New standards are continually being adopted or proposed as a result of worldwide anti-fraud initiatives, encryption of cardholder data, the increasing need for system compatibility and technology developments such as wireless and wireline IP communication. Our solutions also must comply with government regulations, including those imposed by telecommunications authorities and independent standards groups worldwide regarding emissions, radiation, and connections with telecommunications and radio networks, as well as data privacy laws and regulations which regulate the collection, compilation, aggregation, sharing or use of consumer information. We cannot be sure that we will be able to design our solutions to comply with future standards or regulations on a timely basis, if at all. Compliance with these standards could increase the cost of developing or producing our solutions. New products designed to meet any new standards need to be introduced to the market and ordinarily need to be certified by the credit card associations and our customers and, in some cases, local certification bodies, before being purchased. These certification processes are costly and time consuming and increase the amount of time it takes to introduce new products and sell our products. Our business has been in the past and continues to be adversely affected by our failure to timely obtain local certifications in some markets for certain of our products. Moreover, certain uses of our products may subject us to additional regulations and licensing requirements. Various aspects of our services business also are or may be subject to additional regulations and licensing requirements as we expand into new areas. Our business, net revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected if we cannot comply with new or existing industry standards, or obtain or retain necessary regulatory approval or certifications in a timely fashion, or if compliance results in increasing costs of our products. Selling products that are non-compliant may result in fines against us or our customers, which we may be liable to pay. In addition, even if our products are designed to be compliant, compliance with certain security standards is determined based on the merchant's or service provider's network environment in which our systems are installed and, therefore, is dependent upon a number of additional factors such as proper installation of the components of the environment including our systems, compliance of software and system components provided by other vendors, implementation of compliant security processes and business practices and adherence to such processes and practices. Our business and financial condition, as well as our reputation and market share, could be adversely affected if we do not comply with new or existing industry standards and regulations, or obtain or retain necessary regulatory approval or certifications in a timely fashion, or if compliance results in increasing costs of our products.\nOn the other hand, our business also benefits from changes in industry standards and government regulations as well as technological changes, which are large drivers of customer upgrade cycles. For example, as EMV standards were implemented in the U.S., our business benefited as customers upgraded their systems. Nevertheless, if standards are not implemented on the timeline we expect, or at all, if they are implemented but we cannot deliver products that comply with standards in a timely manner or at all, or if the pace of adoption of EMV or other standards slows, our business will suffer. If customers do not continue to upgrade their terminals due to technological changes or changes in standards or government regulations, demand for our offerings could reach a saturation point, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in laws and regulations of privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally-identifying information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is constantly evolving and increasingly demanding. The restrictions imposed by such laws continue to develop and may require us to incur substantial costs, adopt additional compliance measures, such as notification requirements and corrective actions in the event of a security breach, and/or change our current or planned business models. For example, in the U.S., legislation has in recent years been proposed regarding restrictions on the use of geolocation information collected by mobile devices without consumer consent. If ultimately adopted, such legislation or any other restrictions imposed on use of location-based information or geolocation tracking could impact our implementation of mobile-based payments solutions that utilize such information or technology. In addition, we are already subject to strict data privacy laws in the European Union and other jurisdictions governing the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and personally-identifying information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into effect in Europe in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for non-compliance and extends the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company\u2019s location. The GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Such regulations increase our compliance and administrative burden significantly.\nIf our current security measures and data protection policies and controls are found to be non-compliant with relevant laws or regulations in any jurisdiction where we conduct business, we may be subject to penalties and fines, and may need to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures. In addition, we may be required to modify the features and functionality of our system offerings in a way that is less attractive to customers.\nWe are party to a number of lawsuits and tax assessments and we may be named in additional litigation and assessments, all of which are likely to require significant management time and attention and expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently a party in several litigation proceedings. If any of these proceedings are resolved adversely to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in connection with the restatement of our historical interim financial statements during fiscal year 2007, a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers, and purported derivative actions were also filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, we settled with the plaintiffs in the securities class action case caption In re VeriFone Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation for a total of $95.0 million.\nWe are also subject to a number of pending tax assessment matters, particularly in Brazil where such assessments can be difficult to defend and result in substantial losses, and in Israel, where we are currently under audit by the Israel Tax Authority for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 and are subject to a substantial potential tax liability and deficiency penalty assessment in the range of several hundred million dollars for our fiscal years 2008 or 2009. While we continue to believe the Israel Tax Authority assessment is without merit and have appealed the assessment, we cannot be sure of the outcome and our ultimate aggregate exposure. See Note 6, Income Taxes and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to tax assessment matters.\nFurther, our operating results or financial condition may also be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or that are otherwise related to an acquisition. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Hypercom, we have, except for certain matters related to the businesses divested by Hypercom, generally assumed all of Hypercom's litigation proceedings and tax assessments, and may also be liable for certain matters arising after closing of the Hypercom divestitures but related to pre-closing operations.\nWe also are subject to the risk of additional litigation and regulatory proceedings or actions in connection with the restatement of our financial statements. We have responded to inquiries and provided information and documents related to the restatement to the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. We were the subject of a Wells Notice from the SEC stating that the staff of the SEC's Division of Enforcement intended to recommend that the SEC bring a civil injunctive action against us, alleging violations of the federal securities laws arising from the restatement, which we settled in November 2009. Although we have settled this matter with the SEC, additional regulatory inquiries may also be commenced by other U.S. federal, state or foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, we may in the future be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings or actions arising in relation to the restatement of our historical interim financial statements.\nFurthermore, we are, and in the future may be, involved in various litigation and regulatory matters, such as commercial disputes and labor and employment claims, that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nOur insurance policies may not cover certain claims that are filed against us or may not be sufficient to cover all of our costs for defending such actions or paying any damages in the event of an unfavorable outcome. In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify (and advance legal expenses to) both current and former officers, employees and directors in connection with the securities class action and derivative action matters. Although we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage in some or all of these matters, in which case we may have to fund the indemnification amounts owed to such directors and officers ourselves. Because we have a number of pending litigation matters, these amounts may be material.\nThe amount of time and resources required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable, and defending ourselves is likely to divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have in the past incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with these matters. Many members of our senior management team and our Board of Directors have devoted and may be required to devote additional time to our pending litigation matters. Certain of these individuals are named defendants in the litigation related to the restatement actions. If our senior management is unable to devote sufficient time in the future to developing and pursuing our strategic business initiatives and running ongoing business operations, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outcome of litigation and tax assessments is inherently difficult to predict. If any such litigation or tax assessment is resolved adversely to us (whether as a result of a court judgment or a decision by us to settle litigation to avoid the distraction, expense and inherent risks of continued litigation), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, even when we are able to reasonably estimate the probable loss and thus record an accrual for such probable and reasonably estimable loss contingency, the accrual may change due to new developments or changes in our estimates or the amount of our liability could exceed the accrual. For a description of our material pending litigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business may suffer if we are sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or if we are unable to obtain rights to third-party intellectual property on which we depend.\nThird parties have in the past asserted and may in the future assert claims that our products and services infringe their proprietary rights. Such infringement claims, even if meritless, may cause us to incur significant costs in defending against or settling those claims, whether directly or as a result of indemnification obligations. We may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources to develop non-infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology. Similarly, we depend on our ability to license intellectual property from third parties. The third parties from whom we license technology may become unwilling to license to us on acceptable terms intellectual property that is necessary to our business. In addition, we may be unable to acquire licenses for other technology necessary for our business on reasonable commercial terms or at all. As a result, we may be unable to continue to offer the solutions and services upon which our business depends.\nWe have received, and have currently pending, third-party infringement claims and may receive additional notices of claims of infringement in the future. As we expand into other payment technologies and as competition in this area increases, it is possible that the rate at which third parties bring claims will increase. Infringement claims may cause us to incur significant costs in defending against those claims or to settle claims to avoid costly or protracted litigation even if we believe those claims are without merit. Claims may result in additional protracted and costly litigation. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any such patent or other intellectual property would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could result in a significant judgment of damages against us, which could materially and adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur proprietary technology is difficult to protect and unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by third parties may impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology, which could enable competitors to develop services that compete with our own. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other contractual arrangements to establish and protect the proprietary aspects of our solutions. Institution of legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from other business operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that such proceedings would be determined in our favor. We do not have patent protection for certain important aspects of our current solutions. The laws of some countries in which we sell our solutions and services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. If we are unable to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology, competitors or others may be able to use and adapt such technology, which could diminish our competitive advantage and cause us to lose customers to competitors.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our products, including environmental laws and regulations that regulate substances contained in our products.\nWe may be subject to various other legal and regulatory requirements related to the manufacture and sale of our products, such as a European Union directive that places restrictions on the use of hazardous substances (RoHS and RoHS2) in electronic equipment, a European Union directive on WEEE, the European Union's REACH, and the environmental regulations under China RoHS. RoHS and RoHS2 sets a framework for producers' obligations in relation to manufacturing (including the amounts of named hazardous substances contained in products sold) and WEEE sets a framework for treatment, labeling, recovery, and recycling of electronic products in the European Union which may require us to alter the manufacturing of the physical devices that include our solutions and/or require active steps to promote recycling of materials and components. REACH imposes chemicals regulation and controls including requirements for registration of chemicals on the European Union market. In addition, similar legislation could be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the U.S. where many states have already enacted state-level programs and requirements for recycling of certain electronic goods. In addition, climate change legislation in the U.S. is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future. If we do not comply with environmental law and regulations, we may suffer a loss of revenue, be unable to sell in certain markets or countries, be subject to penalties and enforced fees, and/or suffer a competitive disadvantage. Customers may impose certain requirements or levels of compliance due to these regulations and programs that may increase our costs of doing business. Furthermore, the costs to comply with RoHS, RoHS2, WEEE, REACH and China RoHS, or with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2012, the SEC adopted rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring disclosure of the use of certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We filed our most recent report under the disclosure requirement in May 2017 for the 2016 calendar year. Because our supply chain is complex, in preparation of such report, we were dependent on the implementation of diligence procedures we put in place to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or are necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply in response to the findings resulting from such verification activities, as well as information provided by many of our suppliers. To the extent the information we received from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining such information do not satisfy the SEC's diligence requirements, we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products and could face reputational risks. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for conducting diligence procedures. Moreover, these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products, particularly if the number of suppliers offering minerals identified as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that are sourced from locations other than the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries is limited. We may also suffer reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free yet are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nChanges in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including shifts in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction, loss or cessation of tax holidays or other tax benefits, our ability to generate tax credits, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards, the tax impact of nondeductible compensation, and changes in accounting rules, tax laws and regulations, and related interpretations, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The U.S., countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. These potential changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate. For example, the recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform and any changes in laws resulting from the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, along with other significant policy initiatives, could have a material impact on us.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, such assessments involve significant judgment and there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition. We have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Any changes to these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have previously received tax benefits related to our operations in Israel and Singapore. Our subsidiary in Israel (formerly Lipman) previously received tax benefits under Israeli law for capital investments that were designated as \u201cApproved Enterprises\u201d through October 31, 2009. To the extent that these prior year earnings are distributed or deemed distributed, our Israeli subsidiary could be required to remit corporate income tax on these earnings at the applicable rate, between 12.5% and 36.25%. In addition, our subsidiary in Singapore previously received tax benefits under the Singapore Pioneer Tax Holiday provision (the \u201cTax Holiday\u201d) which expired on October 31, 2012. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected to the extent that tax authorities in Singapore challenge our Tax Holiday.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realizable to the extent our future profits are less than we have projected and we may be required to record valuation allowances against previously-booked deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, capital loss carry-forwards and net operating losses. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. In evaluating our deferred income tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our capital loss carry-forwards and net operating losses expire. Our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets requires significant judgment. If we fail to achieve our projections or if we need to lower our projections, we may not have sufficient evidence of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, and we may need to increase our valuation allowance. For example, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013 we recorded a $245.0 million valuation allowance against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, primarily in the U.S., because our three year cumulative U.S. pretax losses raised uncertainty about the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets. If U.S. tax rates are reduced, the value of our U.S. deferred tax asset would decrease and the associated valuation allowance would also decrease. For further information regarding this valuation allowance, see Note 6, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There is no assurance that we will not record a valuation allowance in future periods against previously-booked deferred tax assets. Any increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur internal processes and control over financial reporting have in prior periods been deemed inadequate.\nIn certain prior periods we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which we have remedied. These material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting contributed to our need to restate previously reported interim financial information for each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, and to the delays in the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2007. We also were unable to file our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for our fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2008 and April 30, 2008 on a timely basis.\nAlthough we have implemented improved controls and remedied these material weaknesses, these controls may not be sufficient to detect or prevent errors in financial reporting in future periods and will require continued enhancement to accommodate our rapid growth in operations both organically and from acquisitions. We may hire additional employees and may also engage additional consultants in these and other key areas. Competition for qualified financial control and accounting professionals in the geographic areas in which we operate is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire and retain these individuals.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the price of our securities, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur secured credit facility contains restrictive and financial covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, we will be in default. A default could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe have senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement as described in Note 11, Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, with outstanding loan balances of $826.9 million as of October 31, 2017.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios and restricts the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations, or undertake various other corporate activities. Therefore, as a practical matter, these covenants restrict our ability to engage in or benefit from such activities. Further, VeriFone, Inc. must limit its leverage ratio and maintain its interest coverage ratio at or above specified thresholds. In addition, we have, in order to secure our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement, pledged a substantial amount of our assets and properties. This pledge may reduce our operating flexibility because it restricts our ability to dispose of these secured assets or engage in other transactions that may be beneficial to us.\nIf we are unable to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, we will be in default, which could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and we may not be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance our debt. In addition, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, increases in our leverage ratio could result in increased interest rates and, therefore, higher debt service costs. If we were to default in performance under the Credit Agreement, we may pursue an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there can be no assurance that the lenders would grant such an amendment or waiver and, in light of current credit market conditions, any such amendment or waiver requested is likely to be on terms, including additional fees, as well as increased interest rates and other more stringent terms and conditions that would be materially disadvantageous to us.\nSee Note 11, Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.\nOur indebtedness and debt service obligations under our Credit Agreement are substantial and may adversely affect our cash flow, cash position, and stock price.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and debt service obligations are substantial. As of October 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness outstanding of $826.9 million related to the Credit Agreement, payable in quarterly installments through July 8, 2021. Outstanding amounts may be subject to mandatory prepayment with the proceeds of certain asset sales and debt issuances and, for certain of the loan balances, from a portion of annual excess cash flows (as determined in the Credit Agreement) depending on our total net leverage ratio. See Note 11, Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a schedule of the principal payments due under our credit facilities.\nWe intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from existing cash and cash from operations. A substantial portion of our cash balances and cash generated from operations are held by our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide to distribute or use such cash and cash equivalents outside those foreign jurisdictions, including a distribution to the U.S. we may be subject to additional taxes or costs. In the future, if we are unable to generate or raise additional cash sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and need to use more of our existing cash than planned or to liquidate investments in order to fund these obligations, we may have to delay or curtail the development and/or the sales and marketing of new payment systems and reduce the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividends. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or other sources of liquidity to meet our debt service requirements, our lenders may declare a default on the Credit Agreement which could result in the termination of commitments under the Credit Agreement, the declaration that all outstanding loans are immediately due and payable in whole or in part, and the requirement of cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit.\nInterest rates applicable to our debt are expected to fluctuate based on economic and market factors that are beyond our control. In particular, all of the outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement has a floating interest rate. Although we have entered into a swap arrangement that converts the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for a substantial portion of the principal amount under the Credit Agreement through June 2019, any significant increase in market interest rates, and in particular the short-term LIBOR rates, could result in a significant increase in interest expense on the portion of our debt not covered by such swap arrangement and during periods after the expiration of such swap arrangement, which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness could have significant additional negative consequences, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less-leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nThe conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets may have an adverse effect on other financial transactions.\nDeterioration in the U.S. and international capital markets has in the past had an adverse effect on certain of our financial transactions. If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us, including under the Credit Agreement, or have entered into hedge, insurance or similar transactions with us, are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us or otherwise fulfill their obligations under the relevant transactions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without the need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe amendment of our organizational documents only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovision that any vacancy on the board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office;\n\u2022\ninability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for board nominations and proposing matters to be acted on by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nOur share price has been highly volatile and we expect that the price of our stock may continue to fluctuate substantially.\nOur stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in 2005, for example, due to the announcement of our restatement of certain financial statements in December 2007, during the turmoil in the worldwide financial markets in 2008 and 2009, and more recently following the reporting of certain of our results in 2013 and 2016. In addition to fluctuations related to company-specific factors, broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial guidance or financial estimates by any securities analysts who might cover our stock, or our failure to meet our financial guidance or the estimates made by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nuncertainty about current global or regional economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry or in the technology sector;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we return capital to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors related to acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or divestitures;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions, costs and future events related to shareholder activism;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsales or purchases of our stock, including sales or purchases of our stock by our directors and officers or by significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our stock by us pursuant to our share repurchase program.", "PERMNO": 90657, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "PAY"}
