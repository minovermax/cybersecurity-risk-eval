RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to SmartFinancial, its industry, and its market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our securities are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our securities to decline in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings are dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, business and results of operations.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of any underlying property that serves as collateral for such loans may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In addition, an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. If interest rates were to decrease, our yield on our variable rate loans and on our new loans would decrease, reducing our net interest income. In addition, lower interest rates may reduce our realized yields on investment securities which would reduce our net interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest margin in future periods. A significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe primary tool that management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent third party provider. As of December 31, 2019, SmartFinancial is considered to be in an asset-sensitive position, meaning income is generally expected to increase with an increase in short-term interest rates and, conversely, to decrease with a decrease in short-term interest rates. Based on the results of this simulation model, which assumed a static environment with no contemplated asset growth or changes in our balance sheet management strategies, if short-term interest rates immediately increased by 200 basis points, we could expect net interest income to increase by approximately $2.5 million over a 12-month period. If short-term interest rates immediately decreased by 200 basis points, we could expect net interest income to decrease by approximately $6.0 million over the next 12-month period.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant,\nthe security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral U.S. financial institutions have recently experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. Other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. To date, none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations. However, no assurances can be provided that we may not suffer from such an attack in the future that may cause us material harm. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm to us.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Although we regularly add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cyber security breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing, it is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well as criminal intent on committing cyber-crime. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our ability to increase our assets and earnings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI and to a lesser extent, the FDIC and the CFPB. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank\u2019s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments\nin the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations. Proposed legislative and regulatory actions, including changes to financial regulation, may not occur on the timeframe that is expected, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Further, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. As a result, we may not be able to serve existing indebtedness, and such default may require us to declare bankruptcy. Any capital contributions by a bank holding company to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be incurred by us to make a required capital injection to the Bank becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to the Company could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of\nsome customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company's control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the Company's customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of its customers' products to increase, which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce its customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt. This, in turn, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on the Company or on the markets in which the Company operates its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On November 30, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico signed a new trade deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the President of the United States signed into law on January 29, 2020. The full impact of this agreement on the Company, its customers and on the economic conditions in its geographic markets is currently unknown. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact the Company's and/or its customers' costs, demand for its customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nIf our allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses with respect to our loan portfolio, in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic conditions and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan losses was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair values are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance, if any, associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.54% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 305.76%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or because our banking regulators require us to do so. Federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on economic conditions in our market areas.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our branches are currently concentrated in East and Middle Tennessee, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions, locally or nationally, deteriorate, this may have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we originate, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A return to economic downturn conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, government action, health emergencies, disease pandemics, natural disasters or other factors beyond our control would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, some portions of our target market are in areas which a substantial portion of the economy is dependent upon tourism. The tourism industry tends to be more sensitive than the economy as a whole to changes in unemployment, inflation, wage growth, and other factors which affect consumer\u2019s financial condition and sentiment.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more extensive and broader marketing efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we offer or have the ability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things, our ability to recruit and retain experienced and talented bankers at competitive compensation levels, build and maintain long-term client relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices, compete with the scope, relevance and pricing of the products and services we provide, maintain a competitive level of client satisfaction with our products and services, keep pace with technological advances and invest in new technology, and depend on general economic trend and trends within our industry.\nIncreased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations.\nOur organic loan growth may be limited by regulatory constraints.\nDuring 2019 many of the regulatory agencies, including ours, increased their focus on the application of an interagency guidance issued in 2006, titled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices.\u201d The 2006 interagency guidance focuses on the risks of high levels of concentration in CRE lending at banking institutions, and specifically addresses two supervisory criteria:\n\u2022Construction concentration criterion: Loans for construction, land, and land development (CLD or \u201cconstruction\u201d) represent 100% or more of a banking institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, commonly referred to as the \"100 ratio\"\n\u2022Total CRE concentration criterion: Total nonowner-occupied CRE loans (including CLD loans), as defined in the 2006 guidance (\u201ctotal CRE\u201d), represent 300% or more of the institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and growth in total CRE lending has increased by 50% or more during the previous 36 months, commonly referred to as the \"300 ratio\"\nThe guidance states that banking institutions exceeding the concentration levels mentioned in the two supervisory criteria should have in place enhanced credit risk controls, including stress testing of CRE portfolios. The guidance also states that institutions with CRE concentration levels above those specified in the two supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis. Under the guidance for every $1 in increased capital only $1 can be leveraged to construction lending and only $3 can be lent to total CRE lending. In comparison $1 of capital can be leveraged into about $10 other types of lending. At the end of 2019 our loan portfolio was below both the 100 and 300 ratio as laid out in the guidance, but given the guidance our ability to grow those loan types could be constrained by the amount we are also able to grow capital.\nChanges in accounting standards, including the implementation of Current Expected Credit Loss methodology, could materially affect how we report our financial results.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted a new accounting standard for determining the amount of our allowance for credit losses (ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)) that will be effective for us January 1, 2023, we believe that adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in an increase to our allowance for loan and lease losses, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d). Implementation of CECL will require that we determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected future credit losses on loans in the allowance for loan and lease losses in the period when the loans are booked. The ongoing impact of CECL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for loan and lease losses, decreasing or increasing our net income, and introducing additional volatility into our net income.\nWe may be alleged to have infringed upon intellectual property rights owned by others, or may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nCompetitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights. We also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately prevail); to pay significant money damages; to lose significant revenues; to be prohibited from using the relevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property; to cease offering certain products or services or to incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses. Moreover, it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse, or be unable, to uphold its contractual obligations.\nMoreover, we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks and controls on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage, and in any event, we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property, or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the usage of branding that could be confused with ours could create negative perceptions and risks to our brand and reputation. Our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop technology similar to ours or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them. In addition, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our historical growth has been a result of acquisitions and we intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our strategy may be lost. We also face significant competition from numerous other financial services\ninstitutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions. If we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we must generally satisfy a number of conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including certain bank regulatory approvals, which have become substantially more difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable as a result of the recent financial crisis. Additionally, any future acquisitions may not produce the revenue, earnings or synergies that we anticipated. As our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio, which produces substantially higher yields than our organic and purchased non-credit impaired loan portfolios, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income. If we are unable to replace our purchased credit impaired loans and the related accretion with a significantly higher level of new performing loans and other earning assets due to our inability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, a decline in loan demand, competition from other financial institutions in our markets, stagnation or continued deterioration of economic conditions, or other conditions, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic growth plan contemplates additional acquisitions, which could expose us to additional risks.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management's attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022incurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations; and\n\u2022losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nOur recent acquisition and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nOver the last two years we have completed the acquisitions of Tennessee Bancshares, and Foothills Bancorp. We expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in other select markets through additional branches or through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including the risks detailed below.\nGrowth. As a result of our merger activity, we may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u2022obtain regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022attract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u2022maintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u2022avoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution;\n\u2022maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth;\n\u2022maintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u2022implement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nResults of Operations. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in these markets with the hiring of additional seasoned\nprofessionals with significant experience in that market. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, failure to receive any required regulatory approvals, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and economic factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our targeted markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe merger with Progressive Financial Group, Inc. (\"PFG\"). The merger with PFG was completed on March 1, 2020, and we have begun the process of integrating PFG with SmartBank. A successful integration of this business with ours will depend substantially on our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may not be able to combine our business without encountering difficulties, such as:\n\u2022the loss of key employees;\n\u2022disruption of operations and business;\n\u2022inability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\u2022loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss, including as a result of any decision we may make to close one or more locations;\n\u2022possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\u2022unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or\n\u2022problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations.\nAdditionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of PFG. Further, we expect that the acquisition will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technological efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of this acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate PFG business, including its organizational culture, operations, technologies, services and products, in an efficient and effective manner, our ability to achieve the estimated noninterest expense savings we believe we can achieve, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits on the anticipated timeframe, or at all, could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording our acquisition of PFG. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions, we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, including as a result of de novo expansion into a market, and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur, particularly in the first 12 to 24 months of operations;\n\u2022our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and integration of an acquired company\u2019s operations with ours;\n\u2022the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022entry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022closing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire;\n\u2022the inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all, including as a result of community objections, or such approvals being restrictively conditional; and\n\u2022risks associated with integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets, as well as other markets, throughout the region and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential future acquisitions.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate and construction and development, is subject to risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in these market areas may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 82% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, which includes 12% of our loans secured by construction and development collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Real estate values declined significantly during the recent economic crisis and may decline similarly in future periods. Although real estate prices in most of our markets have stabilized or are improving, a renewed decline in real estate values would expose us to further deterioration in the value of the collateral for all loans secured by real estate and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans, particularly when there is a downturn in the business cycle. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located, each of which could increase the likelihood of default on the loan. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nIf a commercial real estate loan did default there would be legal expenses associated with obtaining the real estate which is typically collateral for the loan. In the last several years the amount of these legal expenses has been low, compared to periods when the defaults of commercial real estate loans have been higher. Once we obtain the collateral for the commercial real estate loan it is put into other real estate owned. Other real estate owned assets generally do not produce income but do have the costs associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs. Since these assets have a cost to maintain our goal is to keep costs at a minimum by liquidating the assets as soon as possible. Among other reasons the rate of loan defaults increase as the economy worsens and declining economic environment and political turmoil generally results in downward pressure on foreclosed asset values and increased marketing periods.\nOur largest loan relationships currently make up a significant percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 10 largest borrowing relationships totaled approximately $154 million in outstanding balances, or approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of relatively large loan relationships is that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be at risk of material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur corporate structure provides for decision-making authority by our regional presidents and banking teams. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected if our employees do not follow our internal policies or are negligent in their decision-making.\nWe attract and retain our management talent by empowering them to make certain business decisions on a local level. Lending authorities are assigned to relationship managers, regional presidents and regional credit officers to make credit decisions based on their experience. Additionally, all loans not in full compliance with the bank\u2019s loan policy must be approved by an additional level of authority. Moreover, for decisions that fall outside of the assigned individual authorities at every level, our teams are required to obtain approval from our Officer Loan Committee and/or Directors Loan Committee. Our local bankers may not follow our internal procedures or otherwise act in our best interests with respect to their decision-making. A failure of our employees to follow our internal policies, or actions taken by our employees that are negligent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeclines in the businesses or industries of our customers could cause increased credit losses and decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans to such businesses. We further anticipate an increase in the amount of loans to small to medium-sized businesses during 2020.\nSmall to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, this, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in our disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from our OREO fair value appraisals.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held an OREO balance of $1.8 million. Our OREO portfolio historically has been insignificant, and generally consisted of properties that we obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Properties in our OREO portfolio are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which the properties previously served as collateral or the \u201cfair value,\u201d which represents the estimated sales price of the properties on the date acquired less estimated selling costs. Generally, in determining \u201cfair value,\u201d an orderly disposition of the property is assumed, except when a different disposition strategy is expected. Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which\nsuch estimates can be considered current is shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales and other estimates used to determine the fair value of our OREO properties.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is conducted, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than estimated, and if a default occurs we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nInterest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nOur adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (WSJPR) or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). However, we may not be able to successfully eliminate all loans tied to LIBOR prior to 2022. Even with \u201cfallback\u201d provisions contained within remaining LIBOR tied loans, changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR could result in customer uncertainty and disputes around how variable rates should be calculated. All of this could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers and additional costs to us, all of which could be material.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity represents an institution\u2019s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs.\nThe objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor, borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs, are met, and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable. We maintain an asset/liability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management policy, including a contingency funding plan that, among other things, include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk. Generally we rely on deposits, repayments of loans and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds. Our principal deposit sources include consumer, commercial and public funds customers in our markets. We have used these funds, together with wholesale deposit sources such as brokered deposits, along with Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (\u201cFHLB Cincinnati\u201d) advances, federal funds purchased and other sources of short-term and long-term borrowings, to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SmartFinancial and SmartBank\u2019s liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our\nborrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets, cause our regulators to criticize our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including demands by customers, rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses, declines in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters, prolonged government shutdowns and other factors. Furthermore, loans generally are not readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in loans, deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such secondary sources include FHLB Cincinnati advances, brokered deposits, secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, Federal Reserve borrowings and/or accessing the equity or debt capital markets.\nWe anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits, loan repayments, and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity. Additionally, where necessary, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources. If we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet our customers\u2019 or creditors\u2019 needs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or our own analysis of the value of the security, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, or instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face additional risks due to our increase in mortgage banking activities that have and could negatively impact our net income and profitability.\nWe have established mortgage banking operations which expose us to risks that are different from our retail and commercial banking operations. During higher and rising interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity tends to decline, which can lead to reduced volumes of business and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. While we have been experiencing historically low interest rates, the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Because we sell a portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking operations also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (a) the existence of an active secondary market and (b) our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. Profitability of our mortgage operations will depend upon our ability to increase production and thus income while holding or reducing costs. In addition, mortgages sold to third-party investors are typically subject to certain repurchase provisions related to borrower refinancing, defaults, fraud or other reasons stipulated in the applicable third-party investor agreements. If the fair value of a loan when repurchased is less than the fair value when sold, we may be required to charge such shortfall to earnings.\nAny expansion into new lines of business might not be successful.\nAs part of our ongoing strategic plan, we will continue to consider expansion into new lines of business through the acquisition of third parties, or through organic growth and development. There are substantial risks associated with such efforts, including risks that (a) revenues from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, compliance, and other implementation costs, (b) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, (c) regulatory compliance obligations prevent the success of a new line of business, and (d) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. Furthermore, it is possible that our unfamiliarity with new lines of business might adversely affect the success of such actions. If any such expansions into new product markets are not successful, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage or to the extent that we incur civil money penalties that are not covered by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nAny deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect us, including resulting in material misstatements in our financial statements, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our operating results could be harmed and it could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in the future. Inferior controls and procedures or the identification of accounting errors could cause our investors to lose confidence in our internal controls and question our reported financial information, which, among other things, could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a higher risk of shareholder litigation, which could result in significant additional expenses and require additional financial and management resources.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards and this continued investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services. Moreover, much of historical loan growth was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations as discussed in \u201cPart 1 - Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Incentive Compensation.\u201d Inability to retain these key personnel or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals' skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in fraudulent, illegal, wrongful or suspicious activities, and/or activities resulting in consumer harm that adversely affects our customers and/or our business. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective and regulatory sanctions and/or penalties, serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract new customers. In addition, improper use or disclosure of confidential information by our employees, even if inadvertent, could result in serious harm to our reputation, financial condition and current and future business relationships. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective.\nWe may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of our loan customers, deposit customers, third party service providers and employees.\nWhen we make loans to individuals or entities, we rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While we attempt to verify information provided through available sources, we cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. Our reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $77.2 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions could result in additional goodwill.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additionally, if our competitors were extending credit on terms we found to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believed did not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from SmartBank. Although the Bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from the Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay. For example, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends, see \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Payment of Dividends\u201d in this Report for further information.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities, including awards to current and future executive officers, directors and employees, which could result in the dilution of shareholders\u2019 investment.\nOur authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had 14,008,233 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and had reserved or otherwise set aside for issuance 136,658 shares underlying outstanding options and 1,916,507 shares that are available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Subject to NASDAQ rules, our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We anticipate that we will issue additional equity in connection with the acquisition of other strategic partners and that in the future we likely will seek additional equity capital as we develop our business and expand our operations, depending on the timing and magnitude of any particular future acquisition. These issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then existing shareholders.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares under our equity compensation plans will result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership of our Common Stock. The exercise price of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our Common Stock. They may profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of Common Stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and time desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022changes in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein, and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they do publish such reports but issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be affected by whether equity research analysts publish research or reports about us and our business. We cannot predict at this time whether any research analysts will publish research and reports on us and our common stock. If one or more equity analysts do cover us and our common stock and publish research reports about us, the price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nIf any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could decline rapidly. If any of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nAlthough there are currently no shares of our preferred stock issued and outstanding, our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 2 million shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval (subject to Nasdaq shareholder approval rules), to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our shareholders (subject to Nasdaq hareholder approval rules) may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to our shareholders.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in the Bank, to secure that debt.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of common stock. For example, interest must be paid to the lender before dividends can be paid to the shareholders, and loans must be paid off before any assets can be\ndistributed to shareholders if we were to liquidate. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if the Bank were profitable.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Subject to certain exceptions, the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (\u201cCIBCA\u201d), and its implementing regulations require that any individual or company acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank or bank holding company, either directly or indirectly, give the Federal Reserve 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of the proposed acquisition. If within that time period the Federal Reserve has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, extended the period for an additional period up to 90 days or requested additional information, the acquisition may proceed. An acquisition may be made before expiration of the disapproval period if the Federal Reserve issues written notice that it intends not to disapprove the acquisition. Acquisition of 25% or more of any class of voting securities constitutes control, and it is generally presumed for purposes of the CIBCA that the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities would constitute the acquisition of control, although such a presumption of control may be rebutted.\nAlso, under the CIBCA, the shareholdings of individuals and companies that are deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether such holders \u201ccontrol\u201d a bank or bank holding company. \u201cActing in concert\u201d under the CIBCA generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a bank holding company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a rebuttable presumption of acting in concert, including where: (i) the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed; (ii) the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company; (iii) the shareholders are immediate family members; or (iv) both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company.\nFurthermore, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHCA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, and subject to certain exceptions, any company would be required to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to obtaining control of a bank or bank holding company. Control under the BHCA exists where a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities, has the ability to elect a majority of a bank holding company\u2019s directors, is found to exercise a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over a bank or bank holding company\u2019s management and policies, and in certain other circumstances. There is a presumption of non-control for any holder of less than 5% of any class of voting securities. Regulatory determination of \u201ccontrol\u201d of a depository institution or holding company, under either the BHCA or CIBCA, is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nWe are subject to Tennessee\u2019s anti-takeover statutes and certain charter provisions that could decrease our chances of being acquired even if the acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nAs a Tennessee corporation, we are subject to various legislative acts that impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if the acquisition would be in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. Our charter also contains provisions which may make it difficult for another entity to acquire us without the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors on our board of directors. Secondly, the amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, certain of our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of our board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals that the board of directors and officers oppose.", "PERMNO": 15906, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMBK"}
