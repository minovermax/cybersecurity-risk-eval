{"cik": "910521", "company": "DECKERS OUTDOOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur short and long-term success is subject to many factors beyond our control. Investing in our common stock involves substantial risk. Before investing in our stock, stockholders and potential stockholders should carefully consider the following risk factors related to our company as well as general investor risks, in addition to the other information contained in this report and the information incorporated by reference in this report. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Please also see the section entitled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 2 of this Annual Report.\nMany of our products are seasonal, and our sales are sensitive to weather conditions.\nSales of our products are highly seasonal and are sensitive to weather conditions, which are beyond our control. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm weather during the fall and winter months may reduce demand for our UGG products. Furthermore, variations in weather conditions across the globe may impact sales of our products in ways that we cannot predict. If management is not able to timely adjust expenses in reaction to adverse events such as unfavorable weather, weak consumer spending patterns or unanticipated levels of order cancellations because of seasonal circumstances, our profitability may be materially affected. Even though we are creating more year-round styles for our brands, the effect of favorable or unfavorable weather on sales can be significant enough to affect our quarterly and annual results, with a resulting effect on our common stock price.\nIf raw materials do not meet our specifications, consumer expectations or experience price increases or shortages, we could realize interruptions in manufacturing, increased costs, higher product return rates, a loss of sales, or a reduction in our gross margins.\nWe depend on a limited number of key sources for certain raw materials. For sheepskin, the raw material used in many of our UGG products, we rely on two tanneries. Both the top grade twin-face and other grades of sheepskin used in UGG products are in high demand and limited supply. Furthermore, our unique sheepskin needs require certain types of sheepskin that may only be found in certain geographic locations and tanneries with sufficient expertise and capacity to deliver sheepskin which meets our specifications. The supply of sheepskin can be adversely impacted by weather conditions, disease, and harvesting decisions that are completely outside our control. For example, if the price of wool increases, sheep herders may choose not to harvest their sheep and instead choose to shear their sheep for wool, thus decreasing the supply of sheepskin. Sheepskin is also a by-product of the food industry and is therefore dependent upon the demand by the food industry, which has generally been decreasing, thus leading to an overall reduction in the number of sheep available. The potential inability to obtain sheepskin, UGGpure and other raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production requirements and could lead to inventory shortages, which can result in lost sales, delays in shipments to customers, strain on our relationships with customers, and diminished brand loyalty. There\nhave also been significant fluctuations in the prices of sheepskin as the demand from competitors for this material and the supply of sheep have changed. We experienced an increase in sheepskin costs in 2012 and a decrease in 2013, with the majority of the decrease being realized in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fiscal year 2015, average sheepskin prices decreased compared to 2013. We attempt to cover the full amount of our sheepskin purchases under fixed price contracts.\nWe began using a new raw material, UGGpure, a wool woven into a durable backing, in some of our UGG products in 2013. If these raw materials and the end product do not conform to our specification or fail to meet consumer expectations, we could experience a higher rate of customer returns and deterioration in the image of our brands, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our sheepskin and UGGpure suppliers warehouse their inventory at a limited number of facilities in China, the loss of any of which due to natural disasters and other adverse events would likely result in shortages of sheepskin or UGGpure leading to delays in the production of our products and could result in a loss of sales and earnings.\nAny price increases in key raw materials will likely raise our costs and decrease our profitability unless we are able to commensurately increase our selling prices and implement other cost-saving measures. Our independent manufacturers use various raw materials in the production of our footwear and accessories that must meet our design specifications and, in some cases, additional technical requirements for performance footwear.\nOur new and existing retail stores may not realize returns on our investments.\nOur retail segment has grown substantially in both net sales and total assets during the past year, and we intend to expand this segment in the future. We have entered into significant long-term leases for many of our retail locations. Global store openings involve substantial investments, including constructing leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, equipment, information systems, inventory, and personnel. In addition, since a certain amount of our retail store costs are fixed, if we have insufficient sales, we may be unable to reduce expenses in order to avoid losses or negative cash flows. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, negative cash flows or the closure of a store could result in significant write-downs of inventory, severance costs, lease termination costs, impairment losses on long-lived assets, or loss of our working capital, which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, from time to time we license the right to operate retail stores for our brands to third parties. We provide training to support these stores, and set and monitor operational standards. However, the quality of these store operations may decline due to the failure of these third parties to operate the stores in a manner consistent with our standards, which could harm their sales and as a result harm our results of operations, result in loss of our capital or other contributions, or cause our brand image to suffer.\nIf we do not accurately forecast consumer demand, we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have difficulty filling our customers' orders.\nBecause the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for design and production, we must plan our production tooling and projected volumes many months before consumer tastes become apparent. The footwear and fashion industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences, making it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products and our future results of operations. Many factors may significantly affect demand for our products, which include: consumer acceptance of our products, the lifecycle of our products and consumer replenishment and buying behavior, changes in consumer demand for products of our competitors, effects of weather conditions, our reliance on manual processes and judgment for certain supply and demand planning functions that are subject to human error, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and weak economic conditions or consumer confidence that reduces demand for discretionary items, such as our products.\nA large number of models, colors, and sizes in our product lines can increase these risks. As a result, we may fail to accurately forecast styles, colors, and features that will be in demand. If we overestimate demand for any products or styles, we may be forced to incur higher markdowns or sell excess inventories at reduced prices resulting in lower, or negative, gross margins. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products or if our independent factories are unable to supply products when we need them, we may experience inventory shortages that may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or delaying shipments to customers. This could negatively affect our relationship with customers and diminish our brand loyalty, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property rights or deter counterfeiting could diminish the value of our brands and reduce sales.\nWe believe that our trademarks, patents, trade dress, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are of value and are integral to our success and our competitive position. Specifically, the success of the UGG brand has led to trademark counterfeiting, product imitation and other infringements of our intellectual property rights. We devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. In spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party\u2019s use related to trademark, trade dress or other\nintellectual property rights, this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operation. If our brands are associated with infringers\u2019 or competitors\u2019 inferior products, this could also adversely affect the integrity of our brands.\nAlthough we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate means, we cannot guarantee that the action we have taken will be adequate to protect our brands and prevent counterfeiting in the future, especially because some countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do US laws. Our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our intellectual property, adequately secure intellectual property rights related to our brands in specific territories, or if a court found that we are infringing on other persons\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in the US or internationally in which we are involved, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, could cost a significant amount of time and money and distract management\u2019s attention from operating our business. If we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims, then we may have to change our manufacturing processes, products, trade names, or enter into costly license agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with the defense of our intellectual property or rebranding could result in higher operating expenses and lower earnings.\nFor example, from time to time, we may need to defend against claims that the word \"ugg\" is a generic term. Such a claim was successful in Australia, but such claims have been rejected by courts in the US, China, Turkey and in the Netherlands. We have also faced claims that \u201cUGG Australia\u201d is geographically deceptive. Any decision or settlement in any of these matters that prevents trademark protection of the \"UGG\" brand in our major markets, or that allows a third-party to continue to use our brand trademarks in connection with the sale of products similar to our products, or to continue to manufacture or distribute counterfeit products could result in intensified commercial competition and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to anticipate and promptly respond to changing fashion and retail trends.\nOur success depends largely on the continued strength of our brands, on our ability to anticipate, understand, and react to the rapidly changing fashion tastes of footwear, apparel, and accessory consumers and to provide appealing merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. We are also dependent on consumer receptivity to our products and marketing strategy. There can be no assurance that consumers will continue to prefer our brands or that we will (1) respond quickly enough to changes in consumer preferences, (2) market our products successfully, or (3) successfully introduce acceptable new models and styles of footwear or accessories to our target consumer. For example, UGG products include fashion items that could go out of style at any time and competition for the sale of products by the UGG brand is intense and has increased over time. If we fail to react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences and fashion trends, consumers may consider our UGG brand image to be outdated or associate our UGG brand with styles that are no longer popular. UGG products represent a majority of our business, and if UGG product sales were to decline or fail to increase in the future, our overall financial performance and common stock price would be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the ongoing economic uncertainty in many countries where we sell our products and the corresponding impact on consumer confidence and discretionary income may increase the uncertainty of consumer preferences. Achieving market acceptance for new products will also likely require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts and expend significant funds to attract consumers. A failure to introduce new products that gain market acceptance or maintain market share with our existing products would erode our competitive position, which would reduce our profits and could adversely affect the image of our brands, resulting in long-term harm to our business.\nFurthermore, the value of our brands is partially based on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities; any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive discounting could negatively affect the image of our brand with our consumers. Negative claims or publicity regarding our company, our products or our brands, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Hence, even if our products do anticipate and promptly respond to changing consumer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of consumers or target markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than ours, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nThe footwear industry is highly competitive, and many new competitors have entered into the marketplace. We believe that some of these competitors have entered the market place in response to the success of our brands and that such competitors have targeted or intend to target our products with their product offerings. Additionally, we have experienced increased competition\nfrom established companies. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution resources than we do, as well as greater brand awareness in the footwear and accessory markets. Our competitors include fashion, athletic and footwear companies, branded apparel companies, and retailers with their own private labels. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and develop new products more quickly. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear and accessory industries.\nAdditionally, efforts by our competitors to dispose of their excess inventories may significantly reduce prices that we can expect to receive for the sale of our competing products and may cause our consumers to shift their purchases away from our products. If we fail to compete successfully in the future, our sales and earnings will decline, as will the value of our business, financial condition, and common stock price.\nWe may not succeed in implementing our growth strategies.\nAs part of our growth strategies, we seek to enhance the positioning of our brands, extend our brands into complementary product categories and markets, partner with or acquire compatible and strategic companies or brands, expand geographically, increase our retail presence, and improve our operational performance. We continue to expand the nature and scope of our operations considerably, including significantly increasing the number of our employees worldwide. We anticipate that substantial further expansion will be required to realize our growth potential and new market opportunities.\nWe are growing globally through our retail, E-Commerce, wholesale, and distributor channels. In addition, as part of our international growth strategy, we may continue to transition from third-party distribution to direct distribution through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Implementing our growth strategies, or failure to effectively execute them, could affect near term revenues from the postponement of sales recognition to future periods, our rate of growth or profitability, which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, our growth initiatives could:\n\u2022\nincrease our working capital needs beyond our capacity;\n\u2022\nincrease costs if we fail to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve expected cost savings;\n\u2022\nresult in impairment charges related to acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ncreate remote-site management issues, which would adversely affect our internal control environment;\n\u2022\nhave significant domestic or international legal or compliance implications;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult to attract, retain, and manage adequate human resources in remote locations;\n\u2022\ncause additional inventory manufacturing, distribution, and management costs;\n\u2022\ncause us to experience difficulty in filling customer orders;\n\u2022\nresult in distribution termination transaction costs; or\n\u2022\ncreate other production, distribution, and operating difficulties.\nWe face risks associated with pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nWe have extended our brands into complementary product categories and markets in part through strategic acquisitions, and we may continue to do so in the future, depending on our ability to identify and successfully pursue suitable acquisition candidates. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering new markets in which we may not have prior experience, potential loss of significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business, managing geographically-remote operations, and potential diversion of management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt or result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. We may not be able to obtain financing for future acquisitions on favorable terms, making any such acquisitions more expensive. Any such financing may have terms that restrict our operations. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into our operations and achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We will face cannibalization of existing product sales by our newly acquired products, unless we adequately\nintegrate new brands and products with our existing products, aggressively target different consumers for our newly acquired products and increase our overall market share. Although we may not consummate a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons, we may nonetheless incur material costs in the preliminary stages of such an acquisition that we may not be able to recover.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets may incur impairment losses.\nWe conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year 2015, 2013, and 2012. In addition, we conducted interim impairment evaluations when impairment indicators arose. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not recognize any material impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIf any brand's product sales or operating margins decline to a point that the fair value falls below its carrying value, we may be required to write down the related intangible assets. These or other related declines could cause us to incur additional impairment losses, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. The value of our trademarks is highly dependent on forecasted revenues and earnings before interest and taxes for our brands, as well as derived discount and royalty rates. In addition, the valuation of intangible assets is subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity. We may also decide to discontinue a brand which would result in the write down of all related intangible assets. The balances of goodwill and nonamortizable intangibles by brand are as follows:\nBecause we depend on independent manufacturers, we face challenges in maintaining a continuous supply of finished goods that meet our quality standards.\nMost of our production is performed by a limited number of independent manufacturers. We depend on these manufacturers' ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturing capacity, and store completed goods in a safe and sound location pending shipment. We do not possess direct control over either the independent manufacturers or their materials suppliers, so we may be unable to obtain timely and continuous delivery of acceptable products. In addition, while we do have long standing relationships with most of our factories, we currently do not have long-term contracts with these independent manufacturers, and any of them may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us. As a result, we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of acceptable quality and competitively priced products from our independent manufacturers. If there is an interruption, we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers to provide products or services of a comparable quality at an acceptable price or on a timely basis. If a change in our independent manufacturers becomes necessary, we would likely experience increased costs as well as substantial disruption of our business, which could result in a loss of sales and earnings.\nInterruptions in the supply chain can also result from natural disasters and other adverse events that would impair our manufacturers' operations. We keep proprietary materials involved in the production process, such as shoe molds, knives, and raw materials, under the custody of our independent manufacturers. If these independent manufacturers were to experience loss or damage to our proprietary materials involved in the production process, we cannot be assured that such independent manufacturers would have adequate insurance to cover such loss or damage and, in any event, the replacement of such materials would likely result in significant delays in the production of our products and could result in a loss of sales and earnings.\nMost of our independent manufacturers are located outside the US, where we are subject to the risks of international commerce.\nMost of our independent manufacturers are in Asia and Latin America, with the majority of production performed by a limited number of manufacturers in China. Foreign manufacturing is subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ntariffs, import and export controls, and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules on raw materials and finished products, including the potential threat of anti-dumping duties and quotas;\n\u2022\nincreasing transportation costs and a limited supply of international shipping capacity;\n\u2022\nincreasing labor costs;\n\u2022\npoor infrastructure and shortages of equipment, which can disrupt transportation and utilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nchanging economic conditions;\n\u2022\nviolations or changes in governmental policies and regulations including labor, safety, and environmental regulations in China, Vietnam, the US, and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nrefusal to adopt or comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, Conflict Minerals Policy and Restricted Substances Policy;\n\u2022\ncustomary business traditions in China and Vietnam such as local holidays, which are traditionally accompanied by high levels of turnover in the factories;\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions;\n\u2022\ndelays during shipping, at the port of entry or at the port of departure;\n\u2022\ndecreased scrutiny by custom officials for counterfeit products;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, which can interrupt commerce, including acts of war and other external factors over which we have no control;\n\u2022\nheightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported products to additional, more frequent or more lengthy inspections;\n\u2022\nimposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nuse of unauthorized or prohibited materials or reclassification of materials;\n\u2022\nexpropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022\ndisease epidemics and health-related concerns that could result in a reduced workforce or scarcity of raw materials;\n\u2022\ndisruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural or other disasters; and\n\u2022\nadverse changes in consumer perception of goods, trade, or political relations with China and Vietnam.\nThese factors, or others of which we are currently unaware or which we do not currently view as material, could severely interfere with the manufacture or shipment of our products. This could make it difficult to obtain adequate supplies of quality products when we need them, thus materially affecting our sales and results of operations.\nWhile we require that our independent manufacturers adhere to environmental, labor, ethical, health, safety, and other standard business practices and applicable local laws, and we periodically visit and audit their operations, we do not control their business practices. If we discovered non-compliant manufacturers or suppliers that cannot or will not become compliant, we would cease dealing with them, and we could suffer an interruption in our product supply chain. In addition, the manufacturers' or designated suppliers' violations of such standards and laws could damage our reputation and the value of our brands, resulting in negative publicity and discouraging customers and consumers from buying our products.\nWe conduct business outside the US, which exposes us to foreign currency, global liquidity, and other risks.\nThe state of the global economy continues to influence the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This affects our business as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our products. The current political and economic environments in certain countries in Europe have resulted in significant macroeconomic risks, including high rates of unemployment, high fuel prices, and continued global economic uncertainty largely precipitated by the European debt crisis.\nWe operate on a global basis, with approximately 35.9% of our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2015 from operations outside the US. As we continue to increase our international operations, our sales and expenditures in foreign currencies become more material and subject to currency fluctuations and global credit markets. A significant portion of our international operating\nexpenses are paid in local currencies. Also, our foreign distributors sell in local currencies, which impact the price to foreign consumers. Many of our subsidiaries operate with their local currency as their functional currency. Future changes in foreign currency exchange rates and global credit markets may cause changes in the US dollar value of our purchases or sales and materially affect our sales, profit margins, or results of operations, when converted to US dollars. Changes in the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies could result in material fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the US dollar value of transactions and, as a result, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected. We currently utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments for the amounts we expect to purchase and sell in foreign currencies to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate. As we continue to expand international operations and increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies, we will evaluate and may utilize additional derivative instruments, as needed, to hedge our foreign currency exposures. Our hedging strategies depend on our forecasts of sales, expenses, and cash flows, which are inherently subject to inaccuracies. Therefore, our hedging strategies may be ineffective. In addition, the failure of financial institutions that underwrite our derivative contracts may negate our efforts to hedge our foreign currency exposures and result in material foreign currency or contract losses. Foreign currency hedging activities, transactions, remeasurements or translations could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWhile our purchases from overseas factories are currently denominated in US dollars, certain operating and manufacturing costs of the factories are denominated in other currencies. As a result, fluctuations in these currencies versus the US dollar could impact our purchase prices from the factories in the event that they adjust their selling prices accordingly.\nLabor disruptions could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business depends on its ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. Labor disputes at or that affect our independent manufacturers, shipping ports, including the recent labor dispute at west coast US ports, tanneries, transportation carriers, retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions. Any such disruption may have a material adverse effect on our business by potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers and unanticipated inventory accumulation, and increased transportation and labor costs, each of which may negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.\nOur sales in international markets are subject to a variety of laws and political and economic risks that may adversely impact our sales and results of operations in certain regions, which could increase our costs and adversely impact our operating results.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. These include:\n\u2022\nchanges in currency exchange rates, which impact the price to international consumers;\n\u2022\nability to move currency out of international markets;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, the interpretation and application of which are uncertain;\n\u2022\nlegal costs and penalties related to defending allegations of non-compliance;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully import into a country;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\ncomplications due to lack of familiarity with local customs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with promoting products in unfamiliar cultures;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nInternational trade and import regulations may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers to markets while the increasing number of free trade agreements has the potential to stimulate increased competition; security procedures may cause significant delays.\nProducts manufactured overseas and imported into the US and other countries are subject to import duties. While we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of the products and our forecasted gross margins.\nWe cannot predict whether future domestic laws, regulations or trade remedy actions or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues. Such changes could increase the cost of our products, require us to withdraw from certain restricted markets, or change our business methods and could make it difficult to obtain products of our customary quality at a competitive price. Meanwhile, the continued negotiation of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements by the US and our other market countries with countries other than our principal sourcing venues may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these other sourcing venues, which now export, or may seek to export, footwear and accessories to our target markets at preferred rates of duty, which may have an effect on our sales and operations.\nAdditionally, the increased threat of terrorist activity and law enforcement responses to this threat have required greater levels of inspection of imported goods and have caused delays in bringing imported goods to market. Any tightening of security procedures, for example, in the aftermath of a terrorist incident, could worsen these delays and increase our costs.\nWe could be adversely affected by the loss of our warehouses.\nThe warehousing of our inventory is located at a limited number of self-managed domestic facilities and self-managed and third-party managed international facilities, the loss of any of which due to natural disasters and other adverse events, could materially adversely impact our sales, business performance, and operating results. In addition, we could face a significant disruption in our domestic distribution center operations if our automated pick module does not perform as anticipated or ceases to function for an extended period, or if our plans for a new distribution facility are disrupted or delayed.\nKey business processes and supporting information systems could be interrupted and adversely affect our business.\nOur future success and growth depend on the continued operation of our key business processes, including information systems, global communications, the internet, and key personnel. Hackers and computer viruses have disrupted operations at many major companies. We may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage. Key processes could also be interrupted by a failure due to weather, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, failure of our computer systems, sabotage, terrorism, or similar event such that:\n\u2022\ncritical business systems become inoperable or require significant costs to restore;\n\u2022\nkey personnel are unable to perform their duties, communicate, or access information systems;\n\u2022\nsignificant quantities of merchandise are damaged or destroyed;\n\u2022\nwe are required to make unanticipated investment in state-of-the-art technologies and security measures;\n\u2022\nkey wholesale and distributor customers cannot place or receive orders;\n\u2022\nE-Commerce customer orders may not be received or fulfilled;\n\u2022\nconfidential information about our customers may be misappropriated or lost damaging our reputation and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to unanticipated liabilities; or\n\u2022\ncarriers cannot ship or unload shipments.\nThese interruptions to key business processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and result in lost sales and reduced earnings.\nFurthermore, we rely on certain information technology management and enterprise resource planning systems to prepare sales forecasts, track our financial and operating results, and otherwise operate our business. As our business grows and we expand\ninto additional distribution channels and geographic regions, these systems may require expansion or modification. We may experience difficulties expanding these information technology and resource planning systems or transitioning to new or upgraded systems, which may result in loss of data or unreliable data, decreases in productivity as our personnel become familiar with and adapt to the new systems, and increased costs for the implementation of the new or upgraded systems. If we are unable to modify our information technology or resource planning systems to respond to changes in our business needs, or if we experience a failure or interruption in these systems, our ability to accurately forecast sales, report our financial and operating results, or otherwise operate our business could be adversely affected.\nThe loss, theft or misuse of sensitive customer or company information, could damage our relationships with customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of sensitive information including the personal information of our customers, credit card information, employee information, data relating to customer preferences, and proprietary company financial and strategic data. The protection of our customer, employee and company data is vitally important to us as the loss, theft or misuse of such information could lead to significant reputational or competitive harm, litigation and potential liability. As a result, we believe that our future success and growth depends, in part, on the ability of our key business processes, including our information and global communication systems, to prevent the theft, loss or misuse of this sensitive information. However, as with many businesses, we are subject to numerous security and cybersecurity risks which may prevent us from maintaining the privacy of sensitive information and require us to expend significant resources attempting to secure such information.\nAs has been well documented in the media, hackers and computer viruses have disrupted operations at many major companies, and we may be vulnerable to similar security breaches. While we have expended, and will continue to expend, resources to protect our customers and ourselves against these breaches and to ensure an effective response to a security or cybersecurity breach, we cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately defend against any such breach. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to attack systems are constantly evolving and, in some cases, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in response, and any breaches that we do not detect may remain undetected for some period. In addition, measures that we do take to prevent risks of fraud and security breaches have the potential to harm relations with our customers or suppliers, or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use or restricting the ability to meet our customers' expectations in terms of their online shopping experience.\nAny failure to maintain the security of our customers\u2019 sensitive information, or data belonging to our suppliers, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of our customers\u2019 confidence in our operations, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data or security breaches that result in unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers, other parties or employees, be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy laws or failing to adequately protect such information or respond to a breach. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes and negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation and our results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the loss of key members of our management team or other key personnel.\nOur future success and growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive officers or other key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel, which may disrupt our business. Our executive officers and other key employees are generally employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees and the often extensive process of identifying and hiring other personnel, who will work effectively with our employees and lead our company to fill those key positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives.\nTo execute our growth plan and achieve our strategic objectives, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel across our company. In particular, in order to continue to develop new products and successfully operate\nand grow our key business processes, it is important for us to continue hiring highly skilled footwear and accessories designers and information technology specialists. Competition for these highly skilled professionals is intense within our industry and there continues to be upward pressure on the compensation paid to these professionals. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater name recognition and financial resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, our headquarters are located in Santa Barbara, California, which is not generally recognized as a prominent commercial center, and it is difficult to attract qualified professionals due to our geographic location. As a result, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining suitably skilled personnel with the qualifications and motivation to expand our business. If we are unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to execute our growth plan, we may be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and our operating results may suffer.\nIn addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards decline, or if the price of our stock experiences significant volatility, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our future growth prospects could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nOur revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions.\nFrom time to time, we have financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowing made under a revolving credit facility. Our credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $400 million. Our obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by our existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, foreign subsidiary holding companies and specified excluded subsidiaries, and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our domestic and first-tier foreign subsidiaries. The agreement for our credit facility also contains a number of customary financial covenants and restrictions, which may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. A default under the credit agreement could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. There were no outstanding borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2015. In addition, we have a credit facility in China (China Credit Facility), which provides for an uncommitted revolving line of credit of up to CNY 60 million, or approximately $10 million. At March 31, 2015, we had approximately $4.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the China Credit Facility.\nThe tax laws applicable to our business are very complex and we may be subject to additional tax liabilities as a result of audits by various taxing authorities or changes in tax laws applicable to our business.\nWe conduct our operations through subsidiaries in several countries including the US, the UK, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, the Netherlands, Bermuda, France, and Canada. As a result, we are subject to tax laws and regulations in each of those jurisdictions, and to tax treaties between the US and other nations. These tax laws are highly complex, and significant judgment and specialized expertise is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision for income taxes.\nWe are subject to audits in each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business, and any of these jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us as a result of their audits. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, and we undertake to prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made and may require a restatement of prior financial reports at a material cost. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, or interest assessments.\nWe are also subject to constant changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties in and between the nations in which we operate. Our tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, including those in and involving the US, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings. It is possible that tax proposals could result in changes to the existing US tax laws that affect us. We are unable to predict whether any proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could increase our income tax liability and adversely affect our net income and long term effective tax rates.\nThe disruption, expense, and potential liability associated with existing and future litigation.\nWe are involved in various claims, litigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and other such proceedings and investigations, we cannot predict with accuracy the ultimate outcome of any such matters. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, and results of operations. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain to address such matters may be inadequate to cover these or other claims. In addition, any significant litigation, investigation, or proceeding, regardless of its merits, could divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations or could negatively impact our reputation in the marketplace.\nNew regulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and annually report to the SEC whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We are currently investigating the use of conflict materials, if any, within our supply chain.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE. While our average daily trading volume for the 52-week period ended May 15, 2015 was approximately 740,000 shares, we have experienced more limited volume in the past and may do so in the future. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The closing prices of our common stock, as reported by the NYSE, have ranged from $66.05 to $99.38 for the 52-week period ended May 15, 2015. The trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations of our future performance, whether realized or perceived;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet such estimates;\n\u2022\npublished research and opinions by securities analysts and other market forecasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nthe financial results and liquidity of our customers;\n\u2022\nshift of revenue recognition as a result of changes in our distribution model, delivery of merchandise, or entering into agreements with related parties;\n\u2022\nclaims brought against us by a regulatory agency or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our sales, expenses, and financial results;\n\u2022\ngeneral equity market conditions and investor sentiment;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions and consumer confidence;\n\u2022\nbroad market fluctuations in volume and price;\n\u2022\nincreasing short sales of our stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements to repurchase our stock;\n\u2022\nthe declaration of stock or cash dividends; and\n\u2022\na variety of risk factors, including the ones described elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our other periodic reports.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. Accordingly, the price of our common stock is volatile and any investment in our stock is subject to risk of loss. These broad market and industry factors and other general macroeconomic conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our common stock price.\nChanges in economic conditions may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatile economic conditions and general changes in the market have affected, and will likely continue to affect consumer spending generally and the buying habits and preferences of our customers and end-user consumers in particular. A significant portion of the products we sell, especially those sold under the UGG brand, are considered to be luxury retail products. The purchase of these products by consumers is largely discretionary, and is therefore highly dependent upon the level of consumer spending, particularly among affluent consumers. Sales of these products may be adversely affected by a continuation or worsening of recent economic conditions, increases in consumer debt levels, uncertainties regarding future economic prospects, or a decline in consumer confidence. During an actual or perceived economic downturn, fewer consumers may shop for our products and those who do shop may limit the amounts of their purchases. As a result, we could be required to reduce the price we can charge for our products or increase our marketing and promotional expenses in response to lower than anticipated levels of demand for our products. In either case, these changes, or other similar changes in our marketing strategy, would reduce our revenues and profit margins and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell our products through higher-end specialty and department store retailers. These retailer customers may be impacted by continuing economic uncertainty, reduced customer demand for luxury products, and a significant decrease in available credit. If reduced consumer spending, lower demand for luxury products, or credit pressures result in financial difficulties or insolvency for these customers, it would adversely impact our estimated allowances and reserves as well as our overall financial results. Also, economic factors such as increased transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, and higher insurance and healthcare costs may increase our cost of sales and our operating expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our business, access to credit, and trading price of common stock could be materially and adversely affected if the current economic conditions do not improve or worsen.\nOur financial success is influenced by the success of our customers.\nMuch of our financial success is directly related to the success of our retailers and distributor partners to market and sell our brands through to the consumer. If a retailer fails to meet annual sales goals, it may be difficult to locate an acceptable substitute retailer. If a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals, it may be difficult and costly to either locate an acceptable substitute distributor or convert to a wholesale direct model. If a change becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, loss of customers, increased credit risk, and increased inventory risk, as well as substantial disruption to operations and a potential loss of sales.\nWe currently do not have long-term contracts with any of our retailers. We do have contracts with our distributors with terms ranging up to five-years, however, while these contracts may have annual purchase minimums which must be met in order to retain the distribution rights, the distributors are not otherwise obligated to purchase product. Sales to our retailers and distributors are generally on an order-by-order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by our wholesale customers. We use the timing of delivery dates in our wholesale customer orders to forecast our sales and earnings for future periods. If any of our major customers, including independent distributors, experience a significant downturn in business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers could postpone, reduce, or discontinue purchases from us. As a result, we could experience a decline in sales or gross margins, write downs of excess inventory, increased discounts or extended credit terms to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and our common stock price.\nOur five largest customers accounted for approximately 22.2% of worldwide net sales in fiscal year 2015 and 23.0% of worldwide net sales in fiscal year 2013. Any loss of a key customer, the financial collapse or bankruptcy of a key customer, or a significant reduction in purchases from a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79686, "SIC": 3100, "TIC": "DECK"}
