The ACA enacts comprehensive changes to the United States health care system, elements of which will be phased in at various stages over the next several years. However, the most significant changes effected by the ACA were implemented as of January 1, 2014. There are a multitude of risks associated with the scope of change in the health care system represented by the ACA, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nRisks associated with the health care federal excise tax. One notable provision of the ACA is an excise tax or annual fee that applies to most health plans, including commercial health plans and Medicaid managed care plans like Molina Healthcare. While characterized as a \"fee\" in the text of the ACA, the intent of Congress was to impose a broad-based health insurance industry excise tax, with the understanding that the tax could be passed on to consumers, most likely through higher commercial insurance premiums. However, because Medicaid is a government funded program, Medicaid health plans have no alternative but to look to their respective state partners for payment to offset the impact of this tax. Additionally, when states reimburse us for the amount of the HIF, that reimbursement is itself subject to income tax, the HIF, and applicable state premium taxes. Because the HIF is not deductible for income tax purposes, our net income is reduced by the full amount of the assessment. The state of California has not formally committed to reimburse us for either the HIF itself, or the related tax effects. The states of Michigan and Utah have reimbursed us for the HIF, but have not formally committed to reimbursement for the related tax effect. The total amount of HIF revenue for which agreements were not secured (and revenue was not recognized) amounted to approximately $20 million for fiscal 2014. We expect to collect and recognize this revenue related to 2014 in 2015. We further expect to recognize revenue in 2015 sufficient to reimburse us for the full amount of the HIF we will pay (along with related tax effects) in September of 2015. We expect our 2015 HIF assessment related to our Medicaid business to be approximately $143 million, with an expected tax effect from the reimbursement of the assessment of approximately $88 million. Therefore, the total reimbursement needed as a result of the Medicaid-related HIF is approximately $231\nmillion. The failure of our state partners to reimburse us in full for the HIF and its related tax effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with the duals expansion. Nine million low-income elderly and disabled people are covered under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These beneficiaries are more likely than other Medicare beneficiaries to be frail, live with multiple chronic conditions, and have functional and cognitive impairments. Medicare is their primary source of health insurance coverage, as it is for the nearly 50 million elderly and under-65 disabled beneficiaries in 2012. Medicaid supplements Medicare by paying for services not covered by Medicare, such as dental care and long-term care services and support, and by helping to cover Medicare\u2019s premiums and cost-sharing requirements. Together, these two programs help to shield very low-income Medicare beneficiaries from potentially unaffordable out-of-pocket medical and long-term care costs. Policymakers at the federal and state levels are increasingly focused on the design and implementation of programs that improve the coordination of care for those who qualify to receive both Medicare and Medicaid services (the \"dual eligible\"), and to deliver services to the dual eligible in a more financially efficient manner. As a result of these efforts, 15 states have undertaken demonstration programs to integrate Medicare and Medicaid services for dual-eligible individuals. The health plans participating in such demonstrations are referred to as Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs). Our MMPs in California, Illinois, and Ohio offered coverage beginning in 2014, and we expect to begin offering MMP coverage in South Carolina and Texas in the first quarter of 2015, and in Michigan in the second quarter of 2015.\nThere are numerous risks associated with the initial implementation of a new program, with a health plan\u2019s expansion into a new service area, and with the provision of medical services to a new population which has not previously been in managed care. One such risk is the development of actuarially sound rates. Because there is limited historical information on which to develop rates, certain assumptions are required to be made which may subsequently prove to have been inaccurate. Rates of utilization could be significantly higher than had been projected, or the assumptions of policymakers about the amount of savings that could be achieved through the use of utilization management in managed care could be flawed. Moreover, because of our lack of actuarial experience for that program, region, or population, our reserve levels may be set at an inadequate level. For instance, these problems arose at our Texas health plan in the second quarter of 2012, leading to extremely elevated medical care costs and substantial losses at the health plan. All of these risks are present in the implementation of the duals demonstration programs. In the event these risks materialize at one or more of our health plans, the negative results of the health plan or plans could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with Medicaid expansion. In the states that have elected to participate, the ACA provides for the expansion of the Medicaid program to offer eligibility to nearly all low-income people under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty line. Medicaid expansion membership phased in beginning January 1, 2014. Since that date, our health plans in California, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, and Washington have begun participating in Medicaid expansion. At December 31, 2014, our membership included approximately 385,000 Medicaid expansion members, or 15% of total membership. The new enrollees in our health plans represent a population that is different from the population of Medicaid enrollees we have historically managed. All of the risk factors described above with regard to the duals demonstration programs apply equally to Medicaid expansion.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with health insurance marketplaces. The ACA authorized the creation of Marketplace insurance exchanges, allowing individuals and small groups to purchase health insurance that is federally subsidized, effective January 1, 2014. We participate in the Marketplace in all of the states in which we operate, except Illinois and South Carolina. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 15,000 Marketplace members, and that enrollment is expected to grow appreciably in 2015, particularly at our Florida health plan. All of the risk factors described above with regard to the duals demonstration programs apply equally to our participation in the insurance marketplaces.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with the King v. Burwell case. There is a case currently pending before the United States Supreme Court to be argued on March 4, 2015, challenging whether the IRS may permissibly promulgate regulations to extend tax-credit subsidies to coverage purchased through exchanges established by the federal government under Section 1321 of the ACA. In the event the Supreme Court rules against Health and Human Services Secretary Burwell, no federal subsidies would be allowed to be paid to those individuals purchasing health insurance through the federally facilitated exchanges, of which there are currently 36. This would undermine the functioning of those exchanges, and cause major disruption under the entire ACA throughout the nation.\n\u2022\nRisk associated with implementing regulations. There are many parts of the ACA that require further guidance in the form of regulations. Due to the breadth and complexity of the ACA, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased nature of the ACA\u2019s implementation, the overall impact of the ACA on our business and on the health industry in general over the coming years is difficult to predict and not yet fully known, and implementing regulations could contain provisions that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage our medical care costs.\nOur profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage our medical care costs. Historically, our medical care cost ratio, meaning our medical care costs as a percentage of our premium revenue net of premium tax, has fluctuated substantially, and has also varied across our state health plans. Because the premium payments we receive are generally fixed in advance and we operate with a narrow profit margin, relatively small changes in our medical care cost ratio can create significant changes in our overall financial results. For example, if our overall medical care ratio, continuing operations, for the year ended December 31, 2014 of 89.5% had been one percentage point higher, or 90.5%, our net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have been approximately $0.12 per diluted share rather than our actual income from continuing operations of $1.30 per diluted share, a decrease of approximately 91%.\nFactors that may affect our medical care costs include the level of utilization of health care services, unexpected patterns in the annual flu season, increases in hospital costs, an increased incidence or acuity of high dollar claims related to catastrophic illnesses or medical conditions for which we do not have adequate reinsurance coverage, increased maternity costs, payment rates that are not actuarially sound, changes in state eligibility certification methodologies, relatively low levels of hospital and specialty provider competition in certain geographic areas, increases in the cost of pharmaceutical products and services, changes in health care regulations and practices, epidemics, new medical technologies, and other various external factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage the costs of providing health care services. The inability to forecast and manage our medical care costs or to establish and maintain a satisfactory medical care cost ratio, either with respect to a particular state health plan or across the consolidated entity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nState and federal budget deficits may result in Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare funding cuts which could reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nNearly all of our premium revenues come from the joint federal and state funding of the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Due to high unemployment levels, Medicaid enrollment levels and Medicaid costs remain elevated at the same time that state budgets are suffering from significant fiscal strain. Because Medicaid is one of the largest expenditures in every state budget, and one of the fastest-growing, it is a prime target for cost-containment efforts. The states in which we operate our health plans regularly face significant budgetary pressures. These budgetary pressures may result in unexpected Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare rate cuts which could reduce our revenues and profit margins. Moreover, some federal deficit reduction or entitlement reform proposals would fundamentally change the structure and financing of the Medicaid program. A number of these proposals include both tax increases and spending reductions in discretionary programs and mandatory programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nWe are unable to determine how any future Congressional spending cuts will affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. There likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care that, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nA failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical care costs may negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause of the time lag between when medical services are actually rendered by our providers and when we receive, process, and pay a claim for those medical services, we must continually estimate our medical claims liability at particular points in time, and establish claims reserves related to such estimates. Our estimated reserves for such \"incurred but not paid\" (IBNP) medical care costs are based on numerous assumptions. We estimate our medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to Medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. Our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer lines of business or populations, such as with respect to duals, Medicaid expansion members, or aged, blind or disabled Medicaid members, is impacted by the more limited experience we have had with those populations.\nThe IBNP estimation methods we use and the resulting reserves that we establish are reviewed and updated, and adjustments, if deemed necessary, are reflected in the current period. Given the numerous uncertainties inherent in such estimates, our actual claims liabilities for a particular quarter or other period could differ significantly from the amounts estimated and reserved for that quarter or period. Our actual claims liabilities have varied and will continue to vary from our estimates, particularly in times of significant changes in utilization, medical cost trends, and populations and markets served.\nIf our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated, our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period could be negatively affected. Our estimates of IBNP may be inadequate in the future, which would negatively affect our\nresults of operations for the relevant time period. Furthermore, if we are unable to accurately estimate IBNP, our ability to take timely corrective actions may be limited, further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results.\nAn increased incidence of flu in one or more of the states in which we operate a health plan could significantly increase utilization rates and medical costs.\nOur results can be significantly impacted by a severe flu season in the states in which we operated our health plans. We seek to set our IBNP reserves appropriately to account for seasonal spikes in the incidence of the flu. However, if the actual utilization rates of our members are higher than we had anticipated, our results in the relevant periods could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the responsive bids of our health plans for new or renewed Medicaid contracts are not successful, or if our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed, our premium revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur government contracts may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. In such process, our health plans may face competition as other plans, many with greater financial resources and greater name recognition, attempt to enter our markets through the competitive bidding process. In the event the responsive bid of one or more of our health plans is not successful, we will lose our Medicaid contract in the applicable state or states, and our premium revenues could be materially reduced as a result. Alternatively, even if our responsive bids are successful, the bids may be based upon assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, or other factors which could result in the Medicaid contract being less profitable than we had expected.\nIn addition, all of our contracts may be terminated for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. Our contracts with the states are also subject to cancellation by the state in the event of the unavailability of state or federal funding. In some jurisdictions, such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required. Further, most of our contracts are terminable without cause.\nOur government contracts generally run for periods of three to four years, and may be successively extended by amendment for additional periods if the relevant state agency so elects. Our current contracts expire on various dates over the next several years. Although our health plans have generally been successful in obtaining the renewal and/or extension of their state contracts, there can be no guarantee that any of our state government contracts will be renewed or extended, as shown by the loss of our Missouri contract in 2012 in connection with an unsuccessful RFP bid. During 2015, our Michigan Medicaid contract will be subject to a new RFP. We expect the Michigan RFP to be released on May 1, 2015, and for the new contract to become effective on October 1, 2015. If we are unable to renew, successfully re-bid, or compete for any of our government contracts, including our Michigan contract, or if any of our contracts are terminated or renewed on less favorable terms, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we sustain a cyberattack or suffer privacy or data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of sensitive personal or confidential information, we could suffer increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of business, and other serious negative consequences.\nAs part of our normal operations, we routinely collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; misplaced or lost data; human errors; acts of malicious insiders, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our members\u2019 data. The cost to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of members, vendors, and state contracts. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about our members could expose our members to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe exorbitant cost of specialty drugs and new generic drugs could have a material adverse effect on the level of our medical costs and our results of operations.\nIn 2014, Gilead\u2019s pricing of the hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, at $84,000 per standard course of therapy received major attention as a health care policy and public policy matter. Because of the relatively high incidence of hepatitis C throughout the nation, particularly in the Medicaid population, the pricing of specialty drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C represents a major public health and public financing problem. In the case of Sovaldi, because of its advent on the health care market in early 2014, the cost of the drug was generally not factored into our 2014 capitation rates, thus threatening to undermine the actuarial soundness of those rates. New high priced specialty drugs and generic drugs are expected to enter the health care market in 2015. In addition, evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our health plans to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members. Other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include, but are not limited to, geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals, and changes in discounts. We will seek to work with state Medicaid agencies to ensure that we receive appropriate and actuarially sound reimbursement for all new drug therapies and pharmaceuticals. In the event we are required to bear the high costs of new specialty drugs or generic drugs without an appropriate rate adjustment or other reimbursement mechanism, or if new regulations or mandates affect our pharmaceutical costs, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nStates may not adequately compensate us for the value of drug rebates that were previously earned by us but that are now collectible by the states.\nACA includes certain provisions that change the way drug rebates are handled for drug claims filled by Medicaid managed care plans. Retroactive to March 23, 2010, state Medicaid programs are now required to collect federal rebates on all Medicaid-covered outpatient drugs dispensed or administered to Medicaid managed care enrollees (excluding certain drugs that are already discounted), and pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay specified rebates directly to the state Medicaid programs for those claims. This has impacted the level of rebates received by managed care plans from the manufacturers for Medicaid managed care enrollees. Many manufacturers have renegotiated or discontinued their rebate contracts with Medicaid managed care plans and pharmacy benefits managers to offset these new rebates paid directly to state Medicaid programs. As a result, the drug rebate amounts paid to managed care plans like ours continue to remain at levels that are much lower than prior to ACA implementation. There are provisions in the ACA that require rates paid to Medicaid managed care plans to be actuarially sound in regard to drug rebates. Although we will be pursuing rate increases with state agencies to make us whole for the rebate amounts lost, there can be no assurances that the premium increases we may receive, if any, will be adequate to offset the amount of the lost rebates. If such premium increases prove to be inadequate, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive our premium revenues from a relatively small number of state health plans.\nWe currently derive our premium revenues from 11 state health plans, with our Puerto Rico health plan expected to commence operations in April 2015. If we are unable to continue to operate in any of those 11 states, or if our current operations in any portion of the states we are in are significantly curtailed, our revenues could decrease materially. Our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly, depending on an abrupt loss of membership, significant rate reductions, a loss of a material contract, legislative actions, changes in Medicaid eligibility methodologies, catastrophic claims, an epidemic, an unexpected increase in utilization, general economic conditions, and similar factors in those states. Our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we currently operate, or a significant change in the nature of our existing operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThere are performance risks and other risks associated with certain provisions in the state Medicaid contracts of several of our health plans.\nThe state contracts of our California, Illinois, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin health plans contain provisions pertaining to at-risk premiums that require us to meet certain quality performance measures to earn all of our contract revenues in those states. In the event we are unsuccessful in achieving the stated performance measure, the health plan will be unable to recognize the revenue associated with that measure. Any failure of our health plans to satisfy one of these performance measure provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In addition, the state contracts of our California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, and Washington health plans contain provisions pertaining to medical cost floors and corridors, administrative cost and profit ceilings, and profit-sharing arrangements. Our Medicare and Marketplace business is also subject to medical cost floor requirements enacted by the Federal government. These provisions are subject to interpretation and application by our health plans. In the event the applicable state government agency disagrees with our health plan\u2019s interpretation or application of the sometimes complicated contract provisions at issue, the health plan could be required to adjust the amount of its obligations under these provisions and/or make a payment or payments to the state. Any interpretation or application of these provisions at\nvariance with our health plan\u2019s interpretation or inconsistent with our revenue recognition accounting treatment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nFailure to attain profitability in any new start-up operations, including in our new Puerto Rico health plan, could negatively affect our results of operations.\nStart-up costs associated with a new business can be substantial. For example, to obtain a certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization in most jurisdictions, we must first establish a provider network, have infrastructure and required systems in place, and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims. Often, we are also required to contribute significant capital to fund mandated net worth requirements, performance bonds or escrows, or contingency guaranties. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the certificate of authority, winning the bid to provide services, or attracting members in sufficient numbers to cover our costs, any new business of ours would fail. We also could be required by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or to recover our significant start-up costs.\nEven if we are successful in establishing a profitable health plan in a new state, increasing membership, revenues, and medical costs will trigger increased mandated net worth requirements which could substantially exceed the net income generated by the health plan. Rapid growth in an existing state will also result in increased net worth requirements. In such circumstances, we may not be able to fund on a timely basis or at all the increased net worth requirements with our available cash resources. All of these risks will pertain to our new start-up Puerto Rico health plan, which is expected to commence operations in April 2015. The expenses associated with starting up a health plan in a new state or commonwealth, or expanding a health plan in an existing state could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nReceipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums could negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member, and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries. These premiums are fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide health care services as established by the state governments. We use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. If premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise, our medical margins will be compressed, and our earnings will be negatively affected. A state could increase hospital or other provider rates without making a commensurate increase in the rates paid to us, or could lower our rates without making a commensurate reduction in the rates paid to hospitals or other providers. In addition, if the actuarial assumptions made by a state in implementing a rate or benefit change are incorrect or are at variance with the particular utilization patterns of the members of one of our health plans, our medical margins could be reduced. Any of these rate adjustments in one or more of the states in which we operate could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nFurthermore, a state undergoing a budget crisis may significantly delay the premiums paid to one of our health plans. Any significant delay in the monthly payment of premiums to any of our health plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nReductions in Medicare payments could reduce our earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans and our duals demonstration programs.\nThe Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 included a 2% reduction of payments from CMS to our Medicare Advantage plans beginning April 1, 2013. Medicare Advantage plans will continue to be affected until Congress lifts the sequestration mandated under the Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012. The impact of sequestration cuts on our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements paid to those providers with rates indexed to the Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. Such reduction in our Medicare payments may have an adverse effect on our earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans and our duals demonstration programs. In addition, reductions to provider reimbursement rates associated with sequestration may adversely impact our relations with the impacted providers.\nDifficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business.\nThe acquisitions of other health plans and the assignment and assumption of Medicaid contract rights of other health plans have accounted for a significant amount of our growth over the last several years. Although we cannot predict with certainty our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions, we believe that additional acquisitions of all sizes will be important to our future growth strategy. Many of the other potential purchasers of these assets-particularly operators of large commercial health plans-have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Also, many of the sellers may insist on selling assets that we do not want, such as commercial lines of business, or may insist on transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets. Even if we identify suitable targets, we may be unable to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us, or at all, or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions. For these reasons, among others, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete favorable acquisitions, especially in light of the volatility in the capital markets over the past several years, or that we will not complete acquisitions that turn out to be unfavorable. Further, to the extent we complete an acquisition, we\nmay be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition because of operational factors or difficulty in integrating the acquisition with our existing business. This may include problems involving the integration of:\n\u2022\nadditional employees who are not familiar with our operations or our corporate culture,\n\u2022\nnew provider networks which may operate on terms different from our existing networks,\n\u2022\nadditional members who may decide to transfer to other health care providers or health plans,\n\u2022\ndisparate information, claims processing, and record-keeping systems,\n\u2022\ninternal controls and accounting policies, including those which require the exercise of judgment and complex estimation processes, such as estimates of claims incurred but not reported, accounting for goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and income tax matters, and\n\u2022\nnew regulatory schemes, relationships, practices, and compliance requirements.\nAlso, we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions of health plans. In the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not already operate, we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state. In addition, although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business, we would be required to obtain regulatory approval if, as a result of the acquisition, we will operate in an area of that state in which we did not operate previously. Furthermore, we may be required to renegotiate contracts with the network providers of the acquired business. We may be unable to obtain the necessary governmental approvals, comply with these regulatory requirements or renegotiate the necessary provider contracts in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn addition, we may be unable to successfully identify, consummate, and integrate future acquisitions, including integrating the acquired businesses on our information technology platform, or to implement our operations strategy in order to operate acquired businesses profitably. Furthermore, we may incur significant transaction expenses in connection with a potential acquisition which may or may not be consummated. These expenses could impact our selling, general and administrative expense ratio.\nFor all of the above reasons, we may not be able to consummate our proposed acquisitions as announced from time to time to sustain our pattern of growth or to realize benefits from completed acquisitions.\nWe face periodic routine and non-routine reviews, audits, and investigations by government agencies, and these reviews and audits could have adverse findings, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits, and investigations. Violation of the laws, regulations, or contract provisions governing our operations, or changes in interpretations of those laws and regulations, could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, the cancellation of our contracts to provide managed care services, the suspension or revocation of our licenses, the exclusion from participation in government sponsored health programs, or the revision and recoupment of past payments made based on audit findings. If we are unable to correct any noted deficiencies, or become subject to material fines or other sanctions, we could suffer a substantial reduction in profitability, and could also lose one or more of our government contracts and as a result lose significant numbers of members and amounts of revenue. In addition, government receivables are subject to government audit and negotiation, and government contracts are vulnerable to disagreements with the government. The final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be different from the amounts we initially recognize in our financial statements.\nWe rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments. Inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations.\nPremium payments to our health plan segment are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments. From time to time, states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program. Alternatively, a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we make or have made related payments to providers and are unable to recoup such payments from the providers.\nWe are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws which may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nBecause we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as \"fraud and abuse\" laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek treble damages, penalties, and assessments. Liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know, or it is found that we should have known, that information\nwe provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent, and some courts have permitted False Claims Act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements. Qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines, or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. We are currently defending two qui tam actions where both the federal and state governments declined to intervene: (i) USA and State of Florida ex rel Charles Wilhelm v. Molina Healthcare and Molina Healthcare of Florida; and (ii) USA ex rel Anita Silingo v. Mobile Medical Examination Service, Molina Healthcare of California, et al. We believe we have meritorious defenses to both matters, and intend to defend both matters vigorously. In the event we are subject to liability under these or other qui tam actions, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by adoption of the new ICD-10 standardized coding set for diagnoses.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has released rules pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which mandate the use of standard formats in electronic health care transactions. HHS also has published rules requiring the use of standardized code sets and unique identifiers for providers. These new standardized code sets, known as ICD-10, will require substantial investments from health care organizations, including us. CMS has now scheduled implementation of ICD-10 by October 1, 2015. Use of the ICD-10 code sets will require significant administrative changes and may result in errors and otherwise negatively impact our service levels. In addition, we may experience complications related to supporting customers that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date. Furthermore, if physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for services provided as a result of the new coding set, we may not be reimbursed, or adequately reimbursed, for such services.\nIf we are unable to deliver quality care, maintain good relations with the physicians, hospitals, and other providers with whom we contract, or if we are unable to enter into cost-effective contracts with such providers, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe contract with physicians, hospitals, and other providers as a means to ensure access to health care services for our members, to manage health care costs and utilization, and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered. We compete with other health plans to contract with these providers. We believe providers select plans in which they participate based on criteria including reimbursement rates, timeliness and accuracy of claims payment, potential to deliver new patient volume and/or retain existing patients, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints, and other factors. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully attract and retain providers to maintain a competitive network in the geographic areas we serve. In addition, in any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher health care costs, disruption to provider access for current members, a decline in our growth rate, or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements.\nThe Medicaid program generally pays doctors and hospitals at levels well below those of Medicare and private insurance. Large numbers of doctors, therefore, do not accept Medicaid patients. In the face of fiscal pressures, some states may reduce rates paid to providers, which may further discourage participation in the Medicaid program.\nIn some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations, and some specialists, may have significant market positions or even monopolies. If these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts which are disadvantageous to us, our profitability in those areas could be adversely affected.\nSome providers that render services to our members are not contracted with our health plans. In those cases, there is no pre-established understanding between the provider and our health plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider. In some states, the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms. In such instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with our health plan. The uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe insolvency of a delegated provider could obligate us to pay its referral claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, or results of operations.\nCircumstances may arise where providers to whom we have delegated risk, due to insolvency or other circumstances, are unable to pay claims they have incurred with third parties in connection with referral services provided to our members. The inability of delegated providers to pay referral claims presents us with both immediate financial risk and potential disruption to member care. Depending on states\u2019 laws, we may be held liable for such unpaid referral claims even though the delegated provider has contractually assumed such risk. Additionally, competitive pressures may force us to pay such claims even when we have no legal obligation to do so or we have already paid claims to a delegated provider and payments cannot be recouped when the delegated provider becomes insolvent. To reduce the risk that delegated providers are unable to pay referral claims,\nwe monitor the operational and financial performance of such providers. We also maintain contingency plans that include transferring members to other providers in response to potential network instability. In certain instances, we have required providers to place funds on deposit with us as protection against their potential insolvency. These funds are frequently in the form of segregated funds received from the provider and held by us or placed in a third-party financial institution. These funds may be used to pay claims that are the financial responsibility of the provider in the event the provider is unable to meet these obligations. However, there can be no assurances that these precautionary steps will fully protect us against the insolvency of a delegated provider. Liabilities incurred or losses suffered as a result of provider insolvency could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nRegulatory actions and negative publicity regarding Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage may lead to programmatic changes and intensified regulatory scrutiny and regulatory burdens.\nSeveral of our health care competitors have recently been involved in governmental investigations and regulatory actions which have resulted in significant volatility in the price of their stock. In addition, there has been negative publicity and proposed programmatic changes regarding Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans, a part of the Medicare Advantage program in which we do not participate. These actions and the resulting negative publicity could become associated with or imputed to us, regardless of our actual regulatory compliance or programmatic participation. Such an association, as well as any perception of a recurring pattern of abuse among the health plan participants in government programs and the diminished reputation of the managed care sector as a whole, could result in public distrust, political pressure for changes in the programs in which we do not participate, intensified scrutiny by regulators, additional regulatory requirements and burdens, increased stock volatility due to speculative trading, and heightened barriers to new managed care markets and contracts, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIf a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated Medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied, our membership in that state will likely decrease.\nStates may only mandate Medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations. Waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two- to five-year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by CMS. We have no control over this renewal process. If a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state\u2019s application for renewal, our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership.\nIf state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries, it may negatively affect our business strategy.\nWe are a corporate parent holding company and hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct subsidiaries. As a holding company, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries. Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries. In addition, our health plan subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that they can pay to us without prior approval of, or notification to, state regulators. In California, our health plan may dividend, without notice to or approval of the California Department of Managed Health Care, amounts by which its tangible net equity exceeds 130% of the tangible net equity requirement. Our other health plans must give thirty days\u2019 advance notice and the opportunity to disapprove \"extraordinary\" dividends to the respective state departments of insurance for amounts over the lesser of (a) ten percent of surplus or net worth at the prior year end or (b) the net income for the prior year. The discretion of the state regulators, if any, in approving or disapproving a dividend is not clearly defined. Health plans that declare non-extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators ten or fifteen days in advance of the intended distribution date of the non-extraordinary dividend. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we received dividends from our health plan subsidiaries amounting to $24.4 million and $101.8 million, respectively. We did not receive any dividends from our health plan subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2014. The aggregate additional amounts our health plan subsidiaries could have paid us at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, without approval of the regulatory authorities, were approximately $96 million, $54 million, and $24 million, respectively. If the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 requests to pay dividends to us, the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy. For example, we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments under our convertible senior notes or any credit facility.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Molina Medicaid Solutions Segment\nWe may be unable to retain or renew the state government contracts of the Molina Medicaid Solutions segment on terms consistent with our expectations or at all.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions currently has management contracts in only six states. If we are unable to continue to operate in any of those six states, or if our current operations in any of those six states are significantly curtailed, the revenues and cash flows of Molina Medicaid Solutions could decrease materially, and as a result our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nIf the responsive bids to RFPs of Molina Medicaid Solutions are not successful, our revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nThe government contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. In such process, Molina Medicaid Solutions may face competition as other service providers, some with much greater financial resources and greater name recognition, attempt to enter our markets through the competitive bidding process. For instance, in 2012, the government contract of Molina Medicaid Solutions in Louisiana was subject to competitive bidding, and we were unsuccessful in being awarded a new contract. Molina Medicaid Solutions also anticipates bidding in other states which have issued RFPs for procurement of a new MMIS. In the event our responsive bids in other states are not successful, we will be unable to grow in a manner consistent with our projections. Even if our responsive bids are successful, the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contract being less profitable than we had expected or had been the case prior to competitive re-bidding.\nBecause of the complexity and duration of the services and systems required to be delivered under the government contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions, there are substantial risks associated with full performance under the contracts.\nThe state contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions typically require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the contracts. These contracts involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of complex technologies. Substantial performance risk exists under each contract. Some or all elements of service delivery under these contracts are dependent upon successful completion of the design, development, construction, and implementation phases. Any increased or unexpected costs or delays in connection with the performance of these contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our state government contracts or government contracting regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions\u2019 contracts with state government customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, contracts with state government customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions, and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. Any failure to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of the contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, imposition of fines, and suspension from future government contracting. Further, any negative publicity related to our state government contracts or any proceedings surrounding them may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. The termination of a state government contract, our suspension from government work, or any negative impact on our ability to compete for new contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nSystem security risks and systems integration issues that disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential government customers.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions routinely processes, stores, and transmits large amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us and damage to our\nbrand and reputation. Accordingly, we could lose existing or potential government customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers\u2019 system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive, and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost government customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, reputation, and stock price.\nIn the course of providing services to customers, Molina Medicaid Solutions may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages.\nThe solutions we provide to our state government customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us. The expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability. Additionally, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new MMIS business or retain existing MMIS business.\nInherent in the government contracting process are various risks which may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe are subject to the risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include government audits of billable contract costs and reimbursable expenses and compliance with government reporting requirements. In the event we are found to be out of compliance with government contracting requirements, our reputation may be adversely impacted and our relationship with the government agencies we work with may be damaged, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur performance on contracts, including those on which we have partnered with third parties, may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments.\nIn some instances, our contracts require that we partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our state government customers. Our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 ability to meet our customers\u2019 delivery schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nRisks Related to our General Business Operations\nIneffective management of our growth may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to grow our membership and to expand into other markets through acquisitions and other opportunities. Continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management and on our other resources. Our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to strengthen our management team and attract, train, and retain skilled employees, and our ability to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems on a timely basis. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions, rapid growth could adversely affect our short-term profitability and liquidity.\nAny changes to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than managed care organizations. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude in interpreting and applying them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact with members and the public. For instance, some states mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. The interpretation of certain contract provisions by our governmental regulators may also change. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations, could reduce our profitability by imposing additional capital requirements, increasing our liability, increasing our administrative and other costs, increasing mandated benefits, forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers, or requiring us to implement additional or\ndifferent programs and systems. Changes in the interpretation of our contracts could also reduce our profitability if we have detrimentally relied on a prior interpretation.\nOur business depends on our information and medical management systems, and our inability to effectively integrate, manage, and keep secure our information and medical management systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is dependent on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, processing provider claims, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, supporting our medical management techniques, and providing data to our regulators. Our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications, claims status, and other information. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information and medical management systems, our operations, ability to pay claims, and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. In addition, if the licensor or vendor of any software which is integral to our operations were to become insolvent or otherwise fail to support the software sufficiently, our operations could be negatively affected.\nOur information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement to meet our operational needs. Moreover, our acquisition activity requires transitions to or from, and the integration of, various information systems. If we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement, maintain, upgrade or expand our system, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, loss of members, difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and member data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our members, providers, or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability, and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if security breaches are not prevented.\nBecause our corporate headquarters are located in Southern California, our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Long Beach, California. In addition, the claims of our health plans are also processed in Long Beach. Southern California is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake than most other parts of the United States. If a major earthquake were to strike the Los Angeles area, our corporate functions and claims processing could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time. Although we have established a disaster recovery and business resumption plan with back-up operating sites to be deployed in the case of such a major disruptive event, there can be no assurances that the disaster recovery plan will be successful or that the business operations of all our health plans, including those that are remote from any such event, would not be substantially impacted by a major Southern California earthquake.\nWe face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal actions, including medical malpractice actions, provider disputes, employment related disputes, and breach of contract actions. In the event we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage, our profitability would suffer. In addition, our providers involved in medical care decisions are exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims. As an employer of physicians and ancillary medical personnel and as an operator of primary care clinics, our plans are subject to liability for negligent acts, omissions, or injuries occurring at one of our clinics or caused by one of our employees. We maintain medical malpractice insurance for our clinics in an amount which we believe to be reasonable in light of our experience to date. However, given the significant amount of some medical malpractice awards and settlements, this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from damage awards or other liabilities. Even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we may have to defend ourselves against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly, and may distract our management\u2019s attention. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business.\nFurthermore, claimants often sue managed care organizations for improper denials of or delays in care, and in some instances improper authorizations of care. Claims of this nature could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable medical malpractice insurance coverage. Successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us, our providers, or our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation, other such liabilities may not be covered by insurance, the insurers could dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance could be insufficient to cover the damages awarded. In addition, insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self-insuring cases against us.\nAlthough we establish reserves for litigation as we believe appropriate, we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover such costs. Therefore, the litigation to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could prompt us to change our operating procedures.\nWe are subject to competition which negatively impacts our ability to increase penetration in the markets we serve.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from business consolidations, new strategic alliances, and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations. We compete for members principally on the basis of size, location, and quality of provider network, benefits supplied, quality of service, and reputation. A number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by the financial resources available to a health plan. Many other organizations with which we compete, including large commercial plans, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. For these reasons, we may be unable to grow our membership, or may lose members to other health plans.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our future testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time and effort. Moreover, if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, SEC, or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in accounting may affect our results of operations.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, or the adoption of new pronouncements could significantly affect our stated results of operations.\nThe value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur investments consist solely of investment-grade debt securities. The unrestricted portion of this portfolio is designated as available-for-sale. Our non-current restricted investments are designated as held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value, and the unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity, unless the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered. For our available-for-sale investments and held-to-maturity investments, if a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such security until its full cost can be recovered, the security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as an expense.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. This review process also entails an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or full cost can be recovered.\nThe current economic environment and recent volatility of the securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. Over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our\njudgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines to be recorded as an expense. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in states with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations, and changes in our interpretations of tax laws, including pending tax law changes, such as the health care federal excise tax discussed above. In addition, we are subject to the routine examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other local and state tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our estimated income tax liabilities. Adverse outcomes from tax examinations could have a material adverse effect on our provision for income taxes, estimated income tax liabilities, or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and other key employees.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our executive officers. The loss of their leadership, knowledge, and experience could negatively impact our operations. Replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the managed care industry have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours. Our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, technical, and medical personnel. It is critical that we recruit, manage, enable, and retain talent to successfully execute our strategic objections which requires aligned policies, a positive work environment, and a robust succession and talent development process. Further, particularly in light of the changing healthcare environment, we must focus on building employee capabilities to help ensure that we can meet upcoming challenges and opportunities. If we are unsuccessful in recruiting, retaining, managing, and enabling such personnel and are unable to meet upcoming challenges and opportunities, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\nWe contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. Our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data. In addition, we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements. Further, we may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of our contracts with third party vendors and service providers. Our outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in vendors\u2019 or service providers\u2019 operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control. If we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk. Violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members, providers, or other third parties, or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business. In turn, this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. Moreover, if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms, and may incur significant costs in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed. In addition, we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers, as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing, unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party, vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and/or regulations, or otherwise. This could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nAn impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill, or our finite-lived intangible assets, could have a material impact on our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the balance of goodwill was $272.0 million, and the balance of intangible assets, net, was $89.3 million. Intangible assets are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying amount. Our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset\u2019s (or asset group\u2019s) carrying value may not be recoverable.\nThe determination of the value of goodwill, and intangible assets, net, requires us to make estimates and assumptions about estimated asset lives, future business trends, and growth. Such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses, and other factors. If an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill, and intangible assets, net, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning and leasing real property.\nWe are a tenant under numerous leases in multiple states, including a 25-year lease of an approximately 460,000 square foot office building housing our principal executive offices in Long Beach, California. We also own a 186,000 square-foot office building in Troy, Michigan, a 26,700 square-foot data center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and a 24,000 square-foot community clinic in Pomona, California. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks generally associated with leasing and owning real estate, which include, but are not limited to: the possibility of environmental contamination, the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems and the risk of damages resulting from such contamination; adverse changes in the value of the property due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors; ongoing maintenance expenses and costs of improvements; the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with changes in zoning, seismic, disability act, or other requirements; inability to renew or enter into leases for space not utilized by us on commercially acceptable terms or at all; and possible disputes with neighboring owners or other individuals and entities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors or a committee thereof has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors or a committee thereof to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of our convertible senior notes.\nMembers of the Molina family own a significant amount of our capital stock, decreasing the influence of other stockholders on stockholder decisions.\nMembers of the Molina family, either directly or as trustees or beneficiaries of Molina family trusts, in the aggregate owned or were entitled to receive upon certain events approximately 32% of our capital stock as of December 31, 2014. Our president and chief executive officer, as well as our chief financial officer, are members of the Molina family, and they are also on our board of directors. Because of the amount of their shareholdings, Molina family members, if they were to act as a group with the trustees of their family trusts, have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our charter, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our company. A significant concentration of share ownership can also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders. Furthermore, the concentration of share ownership in the Molina family could delay or prevent a merger or consolidation, takeover, or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders. Finally, the interests and objectives of the Molina family may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders, and they may vote their common stock in a manner that is contrary to the vote of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nWe may issue equity securities in the future, or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, including sales of shares in connection with any future acquisitions, could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. These sales may have a harmful effect on prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a time and price favorable to us. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, options, or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options, or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase a pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we have authority to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 49,727,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred or other capital stock were issued and outstanding.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price.\nWe are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These provisions may prohibit stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In addition, any change in control of our state health plans would require the approval of the applicable insurance regulator in each state in which we operate.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors,\n\u2022\nprohibition of stockholder action by written consent, and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nIn addition, changes of control are often subject to state regulatory notification, and in some cases, prior approval.", "PERMNO": 89781, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "MOH"}
