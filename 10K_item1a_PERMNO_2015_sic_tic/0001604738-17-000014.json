{"cik": "1604738", "company": "Ashford Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe asset and investment management businesses are highly competitive.\nThe asset and investment management businesses are highly competitive. Competition in these businesses is driven by a variety of factors including: asset and investment performance; the quality of service provided to the companies and investment funds we advise; investor perception of an asset and investment manager\u2019s drive, focus and alignment of interest; terms of investment, including the level of fees and expenses charged for services; our actual or perceived financial condition, liquidity and stability; the duration of relationships with investors; brand recognition; and business reputation. We expect to face competition primarily from other asset and investment management firms, private equity funds, hedge funds, other financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, corporate buyers and other parties. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\nother asset and investment managers may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may offer more products and services than we do or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are;\n\u2022\nAshford Prime, Ashford Trust, other companies that we may advise and any investment funds we manage may not perform as well as the clients of other asset or investment managers;\n\u2022\nseveral other asset and investment managers and their clients have significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar management and investment objectives to ours which may create additional competition for investment management and advisory opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset and investment managers\u2019 clients may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us or the companies that we advise, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to funding opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset managers\u2019 clients may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to facilitate the acquisition and management by their clients of a wider variety of assets and allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to advise their clients to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities on which we would advise our clients to bid;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset or investment management companies and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset or investment management businesses are expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome other asset and investment managers may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets or investments;\n\u2022\nother asset and investment managers may have more scalable platforms and may operate more efficiently than us;\n\u2022\nother asset and investment managers may have better brand recognition than us and there is no assurance that we will maintain a positive brand in the future;\n\u2022\nother industry participants may from time to time seek to recruit members of our management or investment teams and other employees away from us;\n\u2022\nwe face competition in the pursuit of outside investors for any investment funds we manage, acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies, divesting our investments and other investment opportunities;\n\u2022\nan increase in the allocation of capital to our asset and investment strategies by institutional and individual investors could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that we may seek to exploit;\n\u2022\na decrease in the allocation of capital to our asset and investment strategies could intensify competition for that capital and lead to fee reductions and redemptions in any investment funds we manage, as well as difficulty in raising new capital; and\n\u2022\nthe market for qualified professionals is intensely competitive and our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees.\nOur inability to effectively compete on these and other areas may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe investments of the entities we currently advise are concentrated in the hotel industry. Our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector, and we will be significantly influenced by the economies and other conditions in the specific markets in which our asset management clients operate.\nSubstantially all of the investments of Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust are concentrated in the hotel industry. Additionally, investment funds we manage are concentrated in the hospitality, real estate and leisure industries. These concentrations may expose such entities, and therefore us, to the risk of economic downturns in the hotel real estate sector to a greater extent than if the investments of such entities were diversified across other sectors of the real estate or other industries. Similarly, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in areas in which our asset management clients have high concentrations of properties. Industry downturns, relocation of businesses, any oversupply of hotel rooms, a reduction in lodging demand or other adverse economic developments in the hotel industry generally or in areas where our asset management clients have a high concentration of properties could adversely affect us.\nFailure of the hotel industry to exhibit sustained improvement or to improve as expected may adversely affect us.\nCurrently, our primary sources of revenues are the advisory agreements with Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust. A substantial part of the business plan of each of these entities is based on management\u2019s belief that the lodging markets in which such entities invest will experience improving economic fundamentals in the future, despite that fundamentals have already substantially improved over the last several years. In particular, the business strategy of each of these entities is dependent on the expectation that key industry performance indicators, especially RevPAR, will continue to improve. Investment funds we manage rely in part on these assumptions, as well. There can be no assurance as to whether or to what extent, hotel industry fundamentals will continue to improve. If conditions in the industry do not sustain improvement or improve as expected, or deteriorate, we may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies and failure to comply with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries will be subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies. Given our organizational structure, we are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, and other federal, state and local governmental bodies and agencies. We also will be responsible for managing the regulatory aspects of Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust, including compliance with applicable REIT rules. These regulations are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. If we fail to comply with any of the regulations that apply to our business or the businesses of Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust or other entities that we advise, we could be subjected to extensive investigations as well as substantial penalties, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. We also will have numerous contractual obligations that we must adhere to on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. While we have designed policies to appropriately operate our business and the entities we advise, these internal policies may not be effective in all regards and, further, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nWe intend to do business internationally, which may subject us to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience operating internationally but we may do so in the near future, in our capacity as advisor to an entity with international operations. As a result of any future international operations conducted by us, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to currency fluctuations, social or judicial instability, acts or threats of terrorism, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, fund transfer restrictions, capital controls, exchange rate controls, taxes, inadequate intellectual property protection, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, changes in legislation or regulations and other additional international developments or restrictive actions. These risks are especially acute in emerging markets. As in the United States, many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we may do business have been negatively impacted by recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions are showing signs of recovery from the recession that began in late 2007, others continue to experience increasing levels of stress. In addition, the risk of default on sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations.\nWe may also experience difficulty entering new international markets due to regulatory barriers, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems. These difficulties may prevent, or significantly increase the cost of, our international expansion.\nIn addition, changes in policies or laws of the U.S. or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that\nencourage investment could adversely affect our business. If we fail to realize the anticipated growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nOur ability to raise capital and attract investors for our existing and potential clients and our performance is critical to our ability to earn fees and grow our asset and investment management businesses.\nThe base advisory fees that we earn in our asset management business are based on the total market capitalization of the entities that we advise. Accordingly, our base fees are expected to increase if we are able to successfully raise capital in the equity markets for our existing and potential clients. Further, the incentive fees we earn in our asset management business will be primarily driven by the outperformance of our clients as compared with their respective peers, based on total stockholder return. Similarly, the management fees we earn in our investment management business are based upon the assets under management in these investment funds. Accordingly, our management fees are expected to increase if we are able to successfully raise capital from our existing and potential investors. Additionally, the performance allocations or incentive fees we earn in our investment management business is driven by the performance of these investment funds.\nOur ability to earn these fees is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions, political considerations and capital markets. To the extent that general capital markets activity slows down or comes to a halt (as was the case during the recession that began in late 2007), our clients may have difficulty growing. This risk is based on micro- and macro-economic market factors including but not limited to disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, resulting in the lack of access to capital or prohibitively high costs of obtaining or replacing capital. Despite recent improvements, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge.\nWe are predominantly dependent on Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust as our only current asset management clients for substantially all of our operating revenue, the loss of either of which, or their failure or inability to pay any amounts owed to us, including under their advisory agreements, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nAshford Prime and Ashford Trust are the only companies for which we currently provide asset management advisory services. Therefore, our business is subject to the risks of the businesses of each entity. The loss or failure of either company, termination of either advisory agreement, the failure or inability of either company to pay us any amounts owed under their respective advisory agreements, and particularly their failure or inability to pay all or a portion of any applicable termination fee, would adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, these companies could sell assets over time, decreasing their market capitalization, and thereby cause our advisory fees to decrease, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel with long-standing business relationships. The loss of such key personnel could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our management team. In particular, the hotel industry and/or investment experience of Messrs. Monty J. Bennett, Douglas A. Kessler, David A. Brooks, Deric S. Eubanks, Jeremy J. Welter, Mark L. Nunneley and J. Robison Hays, III, and the extent and nature of the relationships they have developed with hotel franchisors, operators, and owners and hotel lending and other financial institutions are critically important to the success of our business. The loss of services of one or more members of our management or investment teams could harm our business and our prospects.\nThe prior performance of Ashford Trust and investment funds we manage are not indicative of our future performance.\nWe have presented information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the historical results of Ashford Trust. When considering this information you should consider that the historical results of Ashford Trust are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from us or our common stock. There are significant differences between Ashford Trust and us, and our financial condition and results of operations could vary significantly because our investment, financing, business and other strategies differ from those of Ashford Trust.\nAs described elsewhere in this document, our future results are subject to many uncertainties and other factors that could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be materially different than that of Ashford Trust.\nAdditionally, the historical and potential future returns of the investment funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock. Therefore, readers should not conclude that positive performance of the investment funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock.\nInvestment funds we manage are subject to counterparty default and concentration risks.\nInvestment funds we manage may enter into numerous types of financing arrangements with counterparties globally, including loans, hedge contracts, swaps, repurchase agreements and other derivative and non-derivative contracts. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight. Generally, investment funds we manage are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. In particular, some of the investment funds we manage utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these investment funds with these counterparties.\nInvestment funds we manage are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur rapidly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack the contractual ability or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which are precisely the times when defaults may be most likely to occur. In the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank, investment funds we manage could incur material losses, and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding.\nInvestment funds we manage are also exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the investment fund to suffer a loss. Counterparty risk is increased for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the investment fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. The absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses.\nIn addition, the risk-management models of investment funds we manage may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not take sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.\nInvestors in investment funds we manage may redeem their investments which would lead to a decrease in our assets under management and, therefore, our revenues.\nInvestors in investment funds we manage may generally redeem their investments on a monthly basis, subject to the applicable fund's specific redemption provisions. Investors may decide to move their capital away from us to other investments for any number of reasons in addition to poor investment performance. Factors that could result in investors leaving investment funds we manage include the need to increase available cash reserves or to fund other capital commitments, changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, the publicly traded nature of the indirect parent of their investment manager, changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest, dissatisfaction with changes in or broadening of an investment fund's investment strategy, changes in our reputation, and departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals. In a declining financial market, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our fee paying assets under management could accelerate. The decrease in our revenues that would result from significant redemptions in our investment business could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur historical financial results as a carve-out of Ashford Trust may not be representative of our results as an independent company.\nSome of the historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been prepared from the accounting records of Ashford Trust and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent company during such periods presented. Certain of the historical costs and expenses reflected in our financial statements include an allocation for certain indirect items including salaries, equity-based compensation and general and administrative expenses pro rata based on an estimate of expenses had the business been run as an independent entity. The allocation methods include relative head count and management\u2019s knowledge of the respective operations of the asset management and advisory business. Such historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we will eventually be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nOur platform may not be as scalable as we anticipate and we could face difficulties growing our business without significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure.\nWhile we believe our platform for operating our business is highly scalable and can support significant growth without substantial new investment in personnel and infrastructure on a relative basis, we may be wrong in that assessment. It is possible that if our business grows substantially, we will need to make significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure to support that growth. We may be unable to make significant investments on a timely basis or at reasonable costs, and our failure in this regard could disrupt our business and operations.\nIf our portfolio management techniques and strategies are not effective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nOur portfolio management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of our operations in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Any failures in our portfolio management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in our operations and could result in losses.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset and investment management contracts or companies, which entails substantial risk.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset and investment management contracts or companies. Such acquisitions entail substantial risk. During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not discover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. We also may not successfully integrate the asset and investment management contracts or companies that we acquire into our business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, to the extent such acquisitions result in us entering new lines of business, we may become subject to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, potentially leading to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Moreover, we may grow our business through joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, control and personnel that are not under our control.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in investment funds we manage can be subject to significant subjectivity, and the values of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for these investment funds.\nThere may be no readily-ascertainable market prices for a number of investments in the investment funds we manage. The fair value of such investments of these investment funds is determined periodically by us based on the methodologies described in the investment funds' valuation policies. These policies are based on a number of factors, including the nature of the investment, the expected cash flows from the investment, bid or ask prices provided by third parties for the investment, the length of time the investment has been held, the trading price of securities (in the case of publicly traded securities), restrictions on transfer and other recognized valuation methodologies. The methodologies we use in valuing individual investments are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions specific to the particular investments, and actual results related to the investment therefore often vary materially from such assumptions or estimates. In addition, because investments held by these investment funds may be in industries or sectors that are unstable, in distress, or in the midst of some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments. Moreover, in many markets, transaction flow is further limited by uncertainty about accurate asset valuations, which may cause hedge fund investors to become concerned about valuations of investment funds that have illiquid or hard-to-value assets. This concern may lead to increased redemptions by investors irrespective\nof the performance of the investment funds. In addition, uncertainty about asset values on redemptions from investments in these investment funds may lead to an increased risk of litigation by investors over net asset values (\u201cNAV\u201d).\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund's NAV do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are sold. The SEC has announced that it is undertaking a significant review of valuation practices within the private equity industry and has instituted enforcement actions against private equity fund advisers for misleading investors about valuation, so there will be increased regulatory scrutiny in the future. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in investment fund NAVs would result in losses for the applicable investment fund, a decline in management fees and the loss of potential performance allocations or incentive fees. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in investment fund NAVs could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which would, in turn, result in redemptions from these investment funds or difficulties in raising additional capital.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose special stockholder voting requirements on these business combinations, unless certain fair price requirements set forth in the MGCL are satisfied; and\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nOur bylaws opt out of the \u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions for certain persons and entities, but we may later amend our bylaws to modify or eliminate these opt-out provisions.\nOur charter provides that a director may be removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the then issued and outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions: a classified board; a two-thirds stockholder vote requirement for removal of a director; a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors; a requirement that a vacancy on the board of directors be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred; and a requirement that the holders of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast request a special meeting of stockholders. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we already require that the number of directors be fixed only by our board of directors and require, unless called by the Chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors, the written request of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then issued and outstanding shares of capital stock to call a special meeting. Additionally, our charter currently provides that directors are elected annually and does not currently provide for a classified board.\nOur charter, bylaws and Maryland law contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us while the plan remains in effect.\nWe have in effect a shareholder rights plan that is intended to protect us from efforts to obtain control of our company that our board of directors believe are inconsistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders. The rights will be exercisable ten days following the earlier of the public announcement that a stockholder (other than us, one of our subsidiaries or employee benefit plans or Mr. Monty J. Bennett and certain of his affiliates and associates (so long as they beneficially own 20% or less of our common stock)) has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors or the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in the ownership of 10% or more\nof our common stock by a person or group of persons (other than one or more of the excluded persons described above). The rights also become exercisable if a person or group that already beneficially owns 10% or more of our common stock (other than one or more of the excluded persons described above) acquires any additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. If the rights become exercisable, all rights holders (other than the person/entity triggering the rights) will be entitled to acquire certain of our securities at a substantial discount. The rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take over our company without the approval of our board of directors, and the rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire our company or a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock, without first negotiating with our board of directors. The rights are set to expire on February 25, 2018.\nStockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks they face as stockholders.\nOur board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding growth and distributions. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of our stockholders. We may change our corporate policies without stockholder notice or consent, which could result in investments or activities that are different than, or in different proportion than, those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under the MGCL charter and our bylaws, stockholders will have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board of directors\u2019 broad discretion in setting policies and stockholders\u2019 inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks stockholders face.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nOur plan, to the extent that market conditions permit, is to grow our business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our organizational documents do not limit us to the management of assets and investment funds within the hospitality industry. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of asset and investment management contracts or companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with: (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nOur constituent documents designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if that Court does not have jurisdiction because the action asserts a federal claim, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur constituent documents provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if that Court does not have jurisdiction because the action asserts a federal claim, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division is the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders or any breach of a standard of conduct of directors; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL, our charter or bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our constituent documents described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our constituent documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies unless we opt to do so.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure unless we irrevocably opt to comply with such requirements. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to:\n\u2022\nprovide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\n\u2022\ncomply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act,\n\u2022\ncomply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer,\n\u2022\ncomply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise,\n\u2022\nprovide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation, or\n\u2022\nhold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation.\nWe have irrevocably opted into complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies and thus will be required to comply with such standards.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with accounting standards newly issued or revised after April 5, 2012, we may be less attractive to investors, and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared and we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nFollowing our separation from Ashford Trust, we became subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(a) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; expand our internal audit function; and hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nFor as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b). We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyber-attacks, security problems or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, billing and operating data. We may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing,\ntransmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our networks and storage applications are subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, interruption or leakage of our systems could harm us.\nIn addition, the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation. In addition, employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nChanges in laws, regulations, or policies may adversely affect our business.\nThe laws and regulations governing our business or the businesses of our clients, or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the federal level or in any of the states in which we or our clients operate, may change at any time and may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as it is phased in over time, will significantly affect the administration of health care services and could significantly impact our cost of providing employees with health care insurance. Our operating entity, Ashford LLC is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Note that although partnerships have traditionally not been subject to federal income tax at the entity level, new audit rules, currently scheduled to become effective for tax years ending after December 31, 2017, will generally apply to the partnership. Under the new rules, unless an entity elects otherwise, taxes arising from audit adjustments are required to be paid by the entity rather than by its partners or members. We may utilize exceptions available under the new provisions (including any changes) and Treasury Regulations so that the partners, to the fullest extent possible, rather than the partnership itself, will be liable for any taxes arising from audit adjustments to the issuing entity\u2019s taxable income. It is unclear to what extent these elections will be available to the partnership and how any such elections may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such elections. Investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible effect of the new rules. We are unable to predict how these or any other future legislative or regulatory proposals or programs will be administered or implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Conflicts of Interest\nOur separation and distribution agreement, our advisory agreements, our mutual exclusivity agreement, the tax matters agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with our separation from Ashford Trust were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis, and we may be unable to enforce or may pursue less vigorous enforcement of their terms because of conflicts of interest with certain of our executive officers and directors and key employees of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime and/or pending or future legal proceedings.\nBecause our officers and two of our directors are also officers of Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime and have ownership interests in Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime, our separation and distribution agreement, our advisory agreements, our mutual exclusivity agreement, the tax matters agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with our separation from Ashford Trust were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis, and we did not have the benefit of arm\u2019s-length negotiations of the type normally conducted with an unaffiliated third party. As a result, the terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to us as an arm\u2019s-length agreement. Furthermore, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and Remington Lodging. For example, we are entitled to indemnification from Ashford Trust OP in the event of breaches of certain provisions of, or misrepresentations made in, the separation and distribution agreement. In addition, we may be unable to enforce certain provisions of our advisory agreements with Ashford Prime or Ashford Trust, including as a result of pending or future legal proceedings. See \u201cRisk Factors- We are currently subject to legal proceedings related to our advisory agreement with Ashford Prime which, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d\nOur assumption of Ashford Trust\u2019s deferred compensation obligations may dilute your interest in our common stock.\nIn connection with our separation from Ashford Trust, we assumed all of the obligations of Ashford Trust\u2019s deferred compensation plan, which plan had only two participants, Mr. Monty J. Bennett and his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. Both Mr.\nMonty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. elected to invest their deferred compensation accounts in our common stock. As a result, we have an obligation to issue approximately 195,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Monty J. Bennett over five years beginning in 2019, which is the end of Mr. Monty Bennett\u2019s deferral period. We also have an obligation to issue approximately 15,000 remaining shares of our common stock to Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., over five years beginning in 2017, which is the end of Mr. Archie Bennett\u2019s deferral period. The issuance of these shares of our common stock will dilute current stockholder\u2019s and, if all such shares are issued, may result in a change of control of our company.\nOur relationships with Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and AIM could create significant conflicts of interest.\nOur chief executive officer and chairman, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, serves as the chief executive officer of Remington Lodging, chairman of the board of Ashford Trust and chairman of the board of Ashford Prime. Additionally, Mr. Monty J. Bennett and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., beneficially own 100% of Remington Lodging. Mr. Monty J. Bennett\u2019s obligations to Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime reduce the time and effort he spends managing our company, and his duties to us as a director and officer may conflict with his duties to, and pecuniary interest in, Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime.\nWe, through Ashford LLC, own approximately 100% of Management Holdco. Performance Holdco owns 99.99% of AIM GP. We, through Ashford LLC and our 100% ownership interest in Performance Holdco's general partner, own approximately 60% of Performance Holdco, and Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. J. Robison Hays own, in the aggregate, 40% of Performance Holdco. AIM currently serves as investment adviser to the AQUA Fund and AHT SMA, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashford Trust. Mr. Bennett\u2019s and Mr. Hays\u2019 duties to us as directors and officers may conflict with their duties to, and pecuniary interests in, Performance Holdco.\nUnder the terms of our mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, we may be obligated to utilize Remington Lodging as a property manager for hotels, if any, we may acquire in the future as well as future platforms that we advise, to the extent we have the discretion to do so, even if the utilization of Remington Lodging for such property management may not be the most advantageous for our hotels or future clients.\nOur mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging requires us to utilize Remington Lodging to provide property management, project management and development services for all hotels, if any, that we may acquire as well as all hotels that future companies we advise may acquire, to the extent that we have the right, or control the right, to direct such matters, unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously vote not to utilize Remington Lodging for such services or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Remington Lodging because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would be in our best interest not to engage Remington Lodging or that another manager or developer could perform the duties materially better. In exchange for our agreement to engage Remington Lodging for such services for all hotels, if any, that we may acquire as well as all future companies that we advise, Remington Lodging has agreed to grant to any such future clients a first right of refusal to purchase any investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that meet the initial investment criteria of such entities, as identified in the advisory agreement between us and such entities, subject to any prior rights granted by Remington Lodging to other entities, including Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and us. Mr. Monty J. Bennett will potentially benefit from the receipt of property management fees, project management fees and development fees by Remington Lodging from us and such future companies that we advise. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Our Mutual Exclusivity Agreement.\u201d Mr. Monty J. Bennett\u2019s ownership interests in and management obligations to Remington Lodging present him with conflicts of interest in making management decisions related to the commercial arrangements between us, the clients we advise and Remington Lodging.\nUnder the terms of our mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, Remington Lodging may be able to pursue lodging investment opportunities that compete with the businesses that we advise.\nPursuant to the terms of our mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, if investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria of Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime or one of our future clients are identified by Remington Lodging or its affiliates, Remington Lodging will give such entity a written notice and description of the investment opportunity. The applicable entity will generally have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If such entity rejects the opportunity, Remington Lodging may then pursue such investment opportunity, subject to any right of first refusal contractually granted by Remington Lodging to any other entity. As a result, it is possible that Remington Lodging could pursue an opportunity that fits within the investment criteria of an entity that we advise and compete with that entity or compete with us. In such a case, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our chief executive officer and chairman, in his capacity as chief executive officer of Remington Lodging could be in a position of directly competing with us or an entity that we advise.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation may result in certain corporate opportunities being assigned to Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors and executive officers may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust and their respective subsidiaries and that we may engage in material business transactions with such entities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will renounce our rights to certain business opportunities, and no director or officer of ours who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust or any of their subsidiaries will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in the applicable advisory agreement) to Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust or any of their respective subsidiaries instead of us, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to us.\nCertain of our executive officers, who are also executive officers or board members of Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime, or both, including our chief executive officer, who is also an executive officer of Remington Lodging, face competing demands relating to their time as well as potential conflicts of interest, and this may adversely affect our operations.\nCertain of our executive officers are also executive officers or board members of Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime, or both. Because our executive officers have duties to Ashford Trust or Ashford Prime, as applicable, as well as to our company, we do not have their undivided attention. They face conflicts in allocating their time and resources between our company, Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime, as applicable, and they will continue to face increasing conflicts as we advise additional companies and platforms.\nThe organization and management of Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust and any companies we may advise in the future may create conflicts of interest.\nWe are or will be party to advisory and other agreements with Ashford Prime and Ashford Trust. These entities, along with any other businesses we may advise in the future will acquire assets consistent with their respective initial investment guidelines, but in each case, we will have discretion to determine which investment opportunities satisfy each such entity\u2019s initial investment guidelines. If, however, either Ashford Trust or Ashford Prime materially changes its investment guidelines without our express consent, we are required to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and other entities we advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any then-existing obligations we may have to such other entities. If a portfolio investment opportunity cannot be equitably divided by asset type and acquired on the basis of such asset types in satisfaction of each such entity\u2019s investment guidelines, we will allocate investment opportunities between Ashford Trust, Ashford Prime and any other businesses we advise in a fair and equitable manner, consistent with such entities\u2019 investment objectives. When determining the entity for which such a portfolio investment opportunity would be the most suitable, our investment professionals have substantial discretions and may consider, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022\ninvestment strategy and guidelines;\n\u2022\nportfolio concentrations;\n\u2022\ntax consequences;\n\u2022\nregulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nliquidity requirements; and\n\u2022\nfinancing availability.\nWe may manage additional investment vehicles in the future and, in connection with the creation of such investment vehicles, may revise these allocation procedures. The result of a revision to the allocation procedures may, among other things, be to increase the number of parties who have the right to participate in investment opportunities sourced by us, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest.\nThe decision of how any potential investment should be allocated among Ashford Prime, Ashford Trust and any other companies we may advise in the future, in many cases, may be a matter of subjective judgment, which will be made by us.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Litigation in connection with conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles. See \u201cRisk Factors- We are currently subject to legal proceedings related to our advisory agreement with Ashford Prime which, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d\nOur fiduciary duties as the sole manager of our operating company could create conflicts of interest with our fiduciary duties to our stockholders.\nWe, as the sole manager of Ashford LLC, our operating company, have fiduciary duties to the other members of Ashford LLC, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. The operating agreement of Ashford LLC provides that, in the event of a conflict in the fiduciary duties owed by us to our stockholders and, in our capacity as manager of our operating company, to its members, we may act in the best interest of our stockholders without violating our fiduciary duties to the members of Ashford LLC or being liable for any resulting breach of our duties to the members, subject in all cases to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing which, pursuant to Maryland law, cannot be waived. In addition, those persons holding Ashford LLC common units will have the right to vote on certain amendments to the operating agreement (which require approval by a majority in interest of the members, including us) and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. These voting rights may be exercised in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. For example, we are unable to modify the rights of Ashford LLC members to receive distributions as set forth in the operating agreement in a manner that adversely affects their rights without their consent, even though such modification might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, conflicts may arise when the interests of our stockholders and the members of our operating company diverge, particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the members.\nOur conflicts of interest policy may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our activities.\nIn order to minimize any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our directors, officers or employees, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to address specifically some of the conflicts relating to our activities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of our disinterested directors is required to approve any transaction, agreement or relationship in which any of our directors, officers, or employees, Ashford Trust or Ashford Prime has an interest, there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise. In addition, the transactions and agreements entered into in connection with our formation prior to the separation and distribution have not been approved by any independent or disinterested persons.\nRisks Related to Debt Financing\nAlthough we do not currently have any debt, we may incur debt in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we currently do not use leverage, our organizational documents do not limit our capacity to use leverage or limit the amount of debt that we may incur. We may, at any time, decide to use leverage to meet future capital needs. We may also, from time to time, use derivative instruments primarily to manage interest rate risk. Future indebtedness will increase our operating costs, particularly in periods of rising interest rates, and we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses that may reduce the overall return on your investment.\nRisks Related to the Transactions\nThe Transactions may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the Transactions in a timely manner could negatively affect our ability to achieve the benefits associated with the Transactions and could negatively affect our share price and future business and financial results.\nThe Transactions are currently expected to close during the first half of 2017, assuming that all of the conditions in the Remington Acquisition Agreement are satisfied or waived. The Remington Acquisition Agreement provides that either the Company or Archie Bennett Jr., Monty J. Bennett, MJB Investments, LP and Mark A. Sharkey (together, the \u201cRemington Sellers\u201d) may terminate the Remington Acquisition Agreement if the closing of the Transactions has not occurred by the stated deadline. On June 22, 2016, the Remington Acquisition Agreement was amended to extend the deadline to October 7, 2016, and on September 22, 2016, the Remington Acquisition Agreement was amended to further extend the deadline to April 7, 2017. To complete the Transactions, our stockholders needed to approve the contribution of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and all of the Company\u2019s business operations to Ashford Advisors, Inc. (\u201cAshford Advisors\u201d) and the potential issuance of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may occur pursuant to the Transactions. On April 12, 2016, our stockholders approved such matters. In addition, the Remington Acquisition Agreement contains additional closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived. Certain events outside our control may delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions. Delays in consummating the Transactions or the failure to consummate the Transactions at all may cause us to incur significant additional costs and to fail to achieve the anticipated benefits associated with the Transactions. In addition, pursuant to the Remington Acquisition Agreement, both the Company and Remington Lodging are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective businesses prior to completing the Transactions. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain strategic transactions, undertaking certain significant capital projects, undertaking certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursuing other actions that are not\nin our ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial. We cannot assure you that the conditions to the completion of the Transactions will be satisfied or waived or that any adverse event, development, or change will not occur, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether or when the Transactions will be completed.\nDelays in consummating the Transactions or the failure to consummate the Transactions at all could also negatively affect our future business and financial results, and, in that event, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will be consummated. If the Transactions are not consummated for any reason, our ongoing business could be adversely affected, and we will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe payment by us of certain costs, including termination fees of $6.7 million if the Remington Acquisition Agreement is terminated by the Company as a result of a Company Intervening Event (as defined in the Remington Acquisition Agreement) or a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in the Remington Acquisition Agreement); and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to consummate the Transactions.\nIn addition, if the Transactions are not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its employees and other stakeholders. The Company could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Transactions or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to compel to perform our obligations under the Remington Acquisition Agreement. If the Transactions are not completed, the Company cannot assure its stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, financial results and the stock price.\nThe Transactions may not be accretive to our stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Transactions may not be accretive to our stockholders. While it is intended that the Transactions be accretive to our performance metrics, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, as, among other things, the expenses we assume as a result of the Transactions may be higher than we anticipate, or revenue from Remington Lodging's business may decrease. The failure of the Transactions to be accretive to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not manage the Transactions effectively in such a manner that we do not realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.\nWe may not manage the Transactions effectively. The Transactions could be a time-consuming and costly process. The combined company may encounter potential difficulties, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine Remington Lodging's business with our Company in a manner that permits each of the businesses to operate effectively or efficiently, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays, or regulatory conditions associated with the Transactions;\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the Transactions and integrating the companies' operations; and\n\u2022\nensuring Remington Lodging does not fail to qualify as an eligible independent contractor within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code as it relates to REITs and hotel properties.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the Transactions could result in the distraction of management, the disruption of the ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in the each business's operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies. Therefore, the failure to plan and manage the Transactions effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will become exposed to risks to which we have not historically been exposed, including liabilities of, and business risks inherent to, Remington Lodging's business.\nThe Transactions will expose us to risks to which we have not historically been exposed. As a result of the Transactions, we will acquire liabilities of Remington Lodging and be subject to ongoing liabilities and business risks inherent to the business of Remington Lodging. Also, we could be subject to additional liabilities as a result of the approximately 7,900 employees who are currently employed by Remington Lodging and could subject us to additional potential liabilities that employers commonly face, such as workers' disability and compensation claims, potential labor disputes and other employee-related liabilities and grievances.\nAddressing these liabilities also could distract management, disrupt our ongoing business or result in inconsistencies in our operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with our lenders, joint venture partners, vendors and employees or to achieve all or any of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.\nRemington Lodging is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Note that although partnerships have traditionally not been subject to federal income tax at the entity level, new audit rules, currently scheduled to become effective for tax years ending after December 31, 2017, will generally apply to the partnership. Under the new rules, unless an entity elects otherwise, taxes arising from audit adjustments are required to be paid by the entity rather than by its partners or members. We may utilize exceptions available under the new provisions (including any changes) and Treasury Regulations so that the partners, to the fullest extent possible, rather than the partnership itself, will be liable for any taxes arising from the audit adjustments to the issuing entity\u2019s taxable income. It is unclear to what extent these elections will be available to the partnership and how any such elections may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such elections. Investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible effect of the new rules.\nThe acquisition of Remington Lodging, including its liabilities, and the incurrence by us of ongoing liabilities and business risks inherent to Remington Lodging's business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to effectively operate our business.\nBecause the management agreements of Remington Lodging are subject to termination in certain circumstances, any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe management agreements under which Remington Lodging provides services to hotels are subject to customary termination provisions. Any termination of a management agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Poor performance of Remington Lodging's business could cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow. In the event that Remington Lodging's business was to perform poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow could decline. Accordingly, poor performance may deter future investment in the Company.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Transactions.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Transactions if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Transactions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of the Transactions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. The Transactions are expected to be accretive to our performance metrics. The extent and duration of any accretion will depend on several factors, including the amount of transaction-related expenses that are charged against our earnings. If expenses charged against earnings are higher than we expected, the amount of accretion in 2017 could be less than currently anticipated and the Transactions may not turn out to be accretive (or may be less accretive than currently anticipated). In such event, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, the risks associated with implementing our long-term business plan and strategy following the Transactions may be different from the risks related to our existing business and trading price of our common stock to be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 15028, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "AINC"}
