Risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on may also adversely affect our business and operation. The following is a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition and future results.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, which limitations or restrictions could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. As a registered bank holding company, we are primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Our bank subsidiary is also primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department.\nBanking industry regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Complying with such regulations is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements by our regulators. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the recession of the last decade. The act requires the issuance of a substantial number of new regulations by federal regulatory agencies which will affect financial institutions, some of which have yet to be issued or implemented.\nPresident Trump and the Congressional majority have indicated that they intend to closely scrutinize the Dodd-Frank Act and that provisions of the act and rules promulgated thereunder may be revised, repealed or amended. While any such reforms are expected to be favorable to our industry, we cannot assure than they will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated under the act may continue to be implemented, and there could be additional new federal or state laws, regulations and policies regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards. Additionally, financial institution regulatory agencies have intensified their response to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including through the issuance of formal enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry or other new legislation or regulations could adversely impact our operations and our financial performance by subjecting us to additional costs, restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services.\nAs regulation of the banking industry continues to evolve, we expect the costs of compliance to continue to increase and, thus, to affect our ability to operate profitably. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies, compensation or operating plans. If these developments negatively impact our ability to implement our business strategies, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have exceeded $10 billion in assets, and as result, we expect to become subject to increased regulatory requirements, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a result of the completion of our acquisition of Giant Holdings, Inc. on February 23, 2017, our total assets and our bank subsidiary\u2019s total assets now exceed $10 billion. Therefore, we anticipate that we and our bank subsidiary will become subject to increased regulatory requirements beginning in 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing requirements. Failure to meet the enhanced prudential standards and stress testing requirements could limit, among other things, our ability to engage in expansionary activities or make dividend payments to our shareholders. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Currently, our bank subsidiary is subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the Federal Reserve is primarily responsible for examining our bank subsidiary\u2019s compliance with consumer protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business. Further, the possibility of changes in the authority of the CFPB by Congress or the Trump Administration is uncertain, and we cannot ascertain the impact, if any, changes to the CFPB may have on our business.\nWith respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to two changes. First, these institutions are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the FDIC. This scorecard considers, among other things, the bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank\u2019s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 2.5 to 45 basis points. Any increase in our bank subsidiary\u2019s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means that, beginning on July 1, 2018, our bank subsidiary will be limited to receiving only a \u201creasonable\u201d interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by our bank subsidiary to our customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. A reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange will reduce our revenues. During fiscal year 2016, we collected $18.5 million in debit card interchange fees. We estimate that had we been subject to this limitation during 2016, our interchange fee revenue would have been reduced by approximately $7.0 million.\nIn anticipation of becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements, we have hired additional compliance personnel and implemented structural initiatives to address these requirements. However, compliance with these requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, and/or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. To ensure compliance with these heightened requirements when effective, our regulators may require us to fully comply with these requirements or take actions to prepare for compliance even before our or our bank subsidiary\u2019s total assets have equaled or exceeded $10 billion at the end of four consecutive quarters. As a result, we may incur compliance-related costs before we might otherwise be required. Our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nDifficult market and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nThe financial crisis and the resulting economic downturn in the latter years of the last decade had a significant adverse impact on the banking industry, and particularly community banks. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. Reduced availability of commercial credit and sustained higher unemployment negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. As a result of these market conditions and the raising of credit standards, our industry experienced commercial and consumer deficiencies, low customer confidence, market volatility and generally sluggish business activity.\nAlthough general economic conditions nationally and locally in our market areas have improved in recent years, we cannot be certain that the recent positive economic trends will continue. The improvement of certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values, rents and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets and may continue to lag behind improvement in the overall economy. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly than other economic sectors. If the positive movement in these economic indicators in our market areas subsides or conditions once again worsen, the adverse effects of an economic downturn on us, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market may result in increased foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies as well as more restricted access to funds. Any such negative events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions, and any future repeal, replacement or amendments to such initiatives or other legislative or regulatory reforms could adversely affect the U.S. banking system or our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 2008, the U.S. Congress, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the FDIC, the CFPB, the SEC and others have taken numerous legislative and regulatory actions to stabilize the U.S. banking system and to prevent future financial crises like the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. These measures have included the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the Treasury to purchase troubled assets and capital securities from banks and their holding companies under the TARP program; significant financial reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act; homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification; the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks; the lowering of the federal funds rate; emergency action against short selling practices; a temporary guaranty program for money market funds; the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back-stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers; efforts by the Federal Reserve to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds; and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector.\nWhile the banking system in the United States has substantially stabilized, it is unknown whether these legislative and regulatory initiatives will produce broad, long-term stability, particularly if conditions in the real estate markets worsen or if any significant negative economic developments occur as a result of fiscal and political uncertainties in the United States and abroad. Should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to fully stabilize the financial markets and prevent similar future crises, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, it is possible that some or many of these initiatives may be subject to revision, repeal or amendment by Congress and the Trump Administration. Any such future reforms may also impact the future stability of the United States banking system.\nAdditionally, President Trump has proposed that Congress enact reforms to the federal tax laws which would include reducing federal corporate income tax rates. While we anticipate that a reduction in corporate tax rates could have a favorable long-term impact on our profitability, any such reforms may negatively affect the carrying value of our existing deferred tax asset and thus could materially and adversely impact our short-term financial results during the period or periods in which such reforms are implemented. For example, while a 5% to 20% reduction in the top marginal federal corporate income tax rate could result in income tax expense savings in the range of approximately $12.6 million to $50.3 million based on our 2016 net income, had such a reduction taken effect on December 31, 2016, we would have incurred a one-time after tax expense in the range of approximately $7.3 million to $29.2 million due to the reduction in value of our existing deferred tax asset. Further, there is no assurance that any potential tax savings from a reduction in corporate tax rates, if enacted, would be realized to the extent anticipated or at all.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all banking organizations. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for our bank subsidiary and us on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in on January 1, 2016, and the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective January 1, 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities.\nWhile our current capital levels well exceed the revised capital requirements, our capital levels could decrease in the future as a result of factors such as acquisitions, faster than anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses and other factors. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in our inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nAdditional bank failures or further changes to the FDIC insurance assessment system may increase our FDIC insurance assessments and result in higher noninterest expense.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 per depositor coverage limit on federal deposit insurance provided by the FDIC. The FDIC has taken a number of actions since 2008 in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF of the FDIC depleted by the increased deposit insurance coverage and the high number of bank failures.\nEffective April 1, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing additional changes to the deposit insurance assessment system, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule, among other things, changes the assessment base for insured institutions, suspends indefinitely certain requirements of the FDIC to pay dividends from the DIF to prevent the DIF from becoming unnecessarily large and adopts, in place of the dividends, progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the reserve ratio exceeds certain levels. Additionally, the final rule changes the method of calculating assessment rates for large institutions and highly complex institutions. As a result of our bank subsidiary exceeding $10 billion in total assets, we anticipate becoming subject to these changes to the method of calculating assessment rates in 2018.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount and timetable for payment of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. There is no guarantee that our assessment rate will not increase in the future. Additionally, if there is another increase in bank or financial institution failures or the recently adopted changes do not have their desired effect of strengthening the DIF reserve ratio, the FDIC may further revise the assessment rates or the risk-based assessment system. Such changes may require us to pay higher FDIC premiums than our current levels, which would increase our noninterest expense.\nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and monetary policy.\nMost of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and thus subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates. Consequently, our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risk. Changes in market interest rates, or changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or changes in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread. In addition to affecting our profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect our business and profitability in numerous other ways. For example, increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing loan demand and the ability of borrowers to repay their current obligations, while decreases in interest rates may affect loan prepayments.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our one-year ratio of interest-rate-sensitive assets to interest-rate-sensitive liabilities was 113.2% and our cumulative repricing gap position was 6.2% of total earning assets, resulting in a limited impact on earnings for various interest rate change scenarios. Floating rate loans made up 37.7% of our $7.39 billion total loan portfolio. A loan is considered fixed rate if the loan is currently at its adjustable floor or ceiling. In addition, 55.6% of our loans receivable and 72.2% of our time deposits at December 31, 2016, were scheduled to reprice within 12 months and our other rate sensitive asset and rate sensitive liabilities composition is subject to change. As a result, our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2016, meaning that we estimate our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates. Significant composition changes in our rate sensitive assets or liabilities could result in a more unbalanced position and interest rate changes would have more of an impact on our earnings.\nOur results of operations are also affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Actions by the Federal Reserve Board involving monetary policies could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand or business and earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which would materially and adversely affect us.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our secured loans. We endeavor to maintain an allowance for loan losses that we consider adequate to absorb future losses that may occur in our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was approximately $80.0 million, or 1.08% of our total loans. In determining the size of the allowance, we analyze our loan portfolio based on our historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\nIf our assumptions are incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient to absorb future loan losses, and increased loan loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. When there is an economic downturn it is more difficult for us to estimate the losses that we will experience in our loan portfolio. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur high concentration of real estate loans and especially commercial real estate loans exposes us to increased lending risk.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 82.1% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. This includes commercial real estate loans (excluding construction/land development) of $3.23 billion, or 43.7% of total loans, construction/land development loans of $1.14 billion, or 15.4% of total loans, and residential real estate loans of $1.70 billion, or 23.0% of total loans. This high concentration of real estate loans could subject us to increased credit risk in the event of a decrease in real estate values in our markets, a real estate recession or a natural disaster. Also, in any such event, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling real estate collateral would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nIn addition to the risks associated with the high concentration of real estate-secured loans, the commercial real estate and construction/land development loans, which comprised 59.1% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016, expose us to a greater risk of loss than our residential real estate loans, which comprised 23.0% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Commercial real estate and land development loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan.\nThe repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial project. If the cash flows from the project are reduced, a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. This cash flow shortage may result in the failure to make loan payments. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan, or in the most extreme cases, we may have to foreclose.\nOur geographic concentration of banking activities and loan portfolio makes us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in our local markets.\nOur bank subsidiary operates through branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and New York City. However, approximately 84.1% of our total loans and 85.7% of our real estate loans as of December 31, 2016, are to borrowers whose collateral is located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida and New York, the states in which the Company has its branch locations. An adverse development with respect to the market conditions of any of these specific market areas or a decrease in real estate values in those market areas could expose us to a greater risk of loss than a portfolio that is spread among a larger geographic base.\nDepressed local economic and housing markets have led to loan losses and reduced earnings in the past and could lead to additional loan losses and reduced earnings.\nDuring the latter years of the last decade, our Florida markets experienced a dramatic reduction in housing and real estate values, coupled with significantly higher unemployment. These conditions contributed to increased non-performing loans and reduced asset quality during this time period. While market conditions in our Florida markets have improved in recent years leading to resulting improvements in our non-performing loans and asset quality, any similar future economic downturn or deterioration in real estate values could cause us to incur additional losses relating to increased non-performing loans. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the then-fair market value of the collateral, which may result in a loss. These loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions deteriorate locally or nationally, our business may be adversely affected. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nIf the value of real estate in our Florida markets were to once again deteriorate, a significant portion of our loans in our Florida market could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, loans in the Florida market totaled $2.46 billion, or 33.3% of our loans receivable. Of the Florida loans, approximately 90.0% were secured by real estate. In prior years, the difficult local economic conditions have adversely affected the values of our real estate collateral in Florida, and they could do so again if the markets were to once again deteriorate in the future. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment on our loans in the event of default by the borrower but may deteriorate in value during the time credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nBecause we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers, a significant loss on any of those loans could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. Under applicable law, our bank subsidiary is generally permitted to make loans to one borrowing relationship up to 20% of its Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2016, the legal lending limit of our bank subsidiary for secured loans was approximately $200.0 million. Our board of directors has established an in-house lending limit of $20.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of both our Chairman, John W. Allison, and our director Richard H. Ashley. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of $3.39 billion, or 45.8% of our total loans, committed to the aggregate group of borrowers whose total debt exceeds the established in-house lending limit of $20.0 million.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally obtained funds principally through local deposits, and we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a more stable source of funds than other borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders. In addition, local deposits reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are less stable time deposits, which may need to be replaced with higher cost funds. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if and to the extent we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nThe loss of key officers may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success depends significantly on our Chairman, John W. Allison, and our executive officers, especially C. Randall Sims, Brian S. Davis, J. Stephen Tipton and Kevin D. Hester plus Centennial Bank Chief Executive Officer and President, Tracy M. French, and our regional Centennial Bank presidents Robert F. Birch, Russell D. Carter, III and Jim F. Haynes, Jr. Centennial Bank, in particular, relies heavily on its management team\u2019s relationships in its local communities to generate business. Because we do not have employment agreements or non-compete agreements with our executive officers and regional bank presidents, these employees are free to resign at any time and accept an employment offer from another company, including a competitor. The loss of services from a member of our current management team may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nGrowth through the acquisition of banks, including FDIC-assisted transactions, and de novo branching represent important components of our business strategy. Any future acquisitions we might make will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\ncredit risk associated with the acquired bank\u2019s loans and investments;\n\u2022\nthe use of inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nthe potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to integrate an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of integrating operations, personnel and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks of impairment to goodwill or other than temporary impairment; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nWe expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe may continue to have opportunities from time to time to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. However, because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These risks include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we may grow through de novo branching. De novo branching and any acquisition carry with them numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe significant upfront costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n\u2022\nthe local market receptivity for branches established or banks acquired outside of those markets in which we currently maintain a material presence;\n\u2022\nthe local economic conditions within the market to be served by the de novo branch or new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022\nthe additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions (including FDIC-assisted transactions) and de novo branching. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability.\nThere may be undiscovered risks or losses associated with our bank acquisitions which would have a negative impact upon our future income.\nOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions of banks. We have acquired 20 banks since we started our first subsidiary bank in 1999, including a total of 14 banks from 2010 through 2015 and one additional bank in February 2017, and we anticipate completing another acquisition in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to consider strategic acquisitions, with a primary focus on Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama and other nearby markets. In most cases, our acquisition of a bank includes the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the target bank\u2019s assets and liabilities, including all or a substantial portion of its loan portfolio. There may be instances when we, under our normal operating procedures, may find after the acquisition that there may be additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities of the target bank, and, with respect to its loan portfolio, that the ability of a borrower to repay a loan may have become impaired, the quality of the value of the collateral securing a loan may fall below our standards, or our determination of the fair value of any such loan may be inadequate. One or more of these factors might cause us to have additional losses or liabilities, additional loan charge-offs, or increases in allowances for loan losses, which would have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with our acquisitions.\nIn connection with our acquisitions since 2010, we have acquired a significant portfolio of loans. Although we marked down the loan portfolios we have acquired, there is no assurance that the non-impaired loans we acquired will not become impaired or that the impaired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value resulting in additional charge-offs to the acquired loan portfolio. Fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential and commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs we make to our loan portfolio, and, may consequently, reduce our net income. Such fluctuations may also increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolios we have acquired in the acquisitions and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nOur acquisitions have caused us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures, which may not result in the material information that we are required to disclose in our SEC reports being recorded, processed, summarized, and reported timely.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to cause the material information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act to be recorded, processed, summarized, and reported to the extent applicable within the time periods required by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. As a result of our acquisitions, we may implement changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal control over financial reporting as part of our integration activities. Notwithstanding any changes to our disclosure controls and procedures resulting from our evaluation of the same after the acquisition, our control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, may not result in the material information that we are required to disclose in our SEC reports being recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within required time periods. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. If, as a result of our acquisitions or otherwise, we are unable to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, investors and customers may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate listing standards, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. We experience strong competition, not only from commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, but also from mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other financial services providers operating in or near our market areas. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans.\nMany of our competitors are much larger national and regional financial institutions. We may face a competitive disadvantage against them as a result of our smaller size and resources and our lack of geographic diversification. Due to their size, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services, our business may be negatively affected. Many of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation that we are as an FDIC-insured institution, which gives them greater operating flexibility and reduces their expenses relative to ours. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nWe also compete against community banks that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small and mid-sized businesses that we target and to use a relationship-based approach similar to ours. In addition, our competitors may seek to gain market share by pricing below the current market rates for loans and paying higher rates for deposits. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nWe may incur environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate and could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. In addition, we acquire branches and real estate in connection with our acquisitions of banks. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients, which may adversely affect our results of operations and future prospects.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur recent results do not indicate our future results and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock.\nWe are unlikely to sustain our historical rate of growth, and may not even be able to expand our business at all. Further, our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.\nFederal and state regulatory authorities require us and our bank subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe that our existing capital (which well exceeds the federal and state capital requirements) will be sufficient to support our current operations, anticipated expansion and potential acquisitions, factors such as faster than anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in regulatory requirements, or additional acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. If we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\nOur directors and executive officers own a significant portion of our common stock and can exert significant influence over our business and corporate affairs.\nOur directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially owned 11.6% of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. Consequently, if they vote their shares in concert, they can significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. The interests of our officers and directors may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting the Company with which you disagree.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on us.\nLike other coastal areas, our markets in Alabama and Florida are susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or other weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties or other collateral securing our loans and an increase in the delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of hurricanes or other significant weather events.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the holders of any debt securities that we may issue from time to time and may be subordinate to the holders of any series of preferred stock that may issue in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $60.8 million of subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are unconditionally guaranteed by us. The subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our capital stock. If we elect to defer or if we default with respect to our obligations to make payments on these subordinated debentures, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue in the aggregate up to 5,500,000 shares of preferred stock, and to incur senior or subordinated indebtedness, generally without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights that may be superior to the rights of our common stock. In addition, like our outstanding subordinated debentures, any future indebtedness that we incur would be expected to be senior to our common stock with respect to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Accordingly, common shareholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock since the second quarter of 2003 and expect to continue this practice, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue. Our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nWe may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our bank subsidiary, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of that bank to pay dividends.\n\u2022\nFederal Reserve Board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition.\n\u2022\nBefore dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, payments must be made on our subordinated debentures.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy.\nIf we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event our bank subsidiary becomes unable, due to regulatory restrictions, capital planning needs or otherwise, to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock.\nOur stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of our common stock are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume in the common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91356, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HOMB"}
