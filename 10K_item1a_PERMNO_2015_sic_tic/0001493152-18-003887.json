{"cik": "1591890", "company": "1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe may not have future opportunities to participate in take-out programs.\nWe were able to obtain policies from the last six annual LA Citizens take-outs occurring on December 1st of each year from 2012 to 2017, from which we have approximately 12,000 policies in-force or approximately 24% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, we participated in our first depopulation from FL Citizens on December 19, 2017, and the inaugural take-out of policies from TWIA on December 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 we have assumed 3,444 and 745 policies for the coverages of wind and hail only from FL Citizens and TWIA, respectively. In the future, we may not be able to obtain the quantity or quality of policies currently obtained due to changes in the take-out programs, our inability to meet take-out program participation requirements, or due to changes to the market in general. Additionally, competitors could change their risk profile characteristics, and write these risks directly, which would cause us to lose these policies. The loss of these policies could impact our ability to absorb fixed expenses with lower volumes in the future.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nA substantial portion of our in-force policies have been assumed from state-run insurers and cover losses arising only from wind and hail, which creates a large concentration of our business in wind and hail only coverage and limits our ability to implement our restrictive underwriting guidelines.\nWhile both LA Citizens and FL Citizens write full peril protection policies in addition to wind and hail only policies, the majority of policies that we have obtained through these insurers\u2019 take-out programs cover losses arising only from wind and hail. Furthermore, the policies which we have assumed from TWIA are wind and hail only policies, as TWIA does not write full peril protection policies. Prior to our take-out, some of these LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA policyholders may not have been able to obtain such coverage from any other marketplace. Approximately 26% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2017 represent LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA wind and hail only policies. These exposures may subject us to greater risk from catastrophic events. While our voluntary independent agency program includes various restrictive underwriting strategies, we are unable to implement these strategies to the wind and hail only policies that are taken-out from LA and FL Citizens and TWIA. Pursuant to these depopulation programs, we must offer a minimum number of renewals on any policy taken out under the program, thus limiting our ability to implement some of our underwriting guidelines. Upon renewal of these policies, however, we analyze replacement cost scenarios to ensure the appropriate amount of coverage is in effect. Our results may be negatively impacted by these limitations.\nWe have a risk posed by the lack of geographic diversification and concentration of policyholders in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had covered risks on approximately 51,000 direct and assumed policies. Of these policies, 34,500, or approximately 68% are in Louisiana, 12,800, or approximately 25%, are in Texas, while the remaining 3,400 policies, or 7% of policies, are in Florida. These three states have significant exposed coastline. According to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, over 2 million residents - approximately 47% of the state\u2019s population based on 2009 U.S. Census estimates - live in Louisiana\u2019s coastal parishes.\nMaison insures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2017, these policies are concentrated within these parishes, presented as a percentage of our total direct and assumed policies in all states, as follows: Saint Tammany Parish, 9.8%, Jefferson Parish, 9.2%, and East Baton Rouge Parish, 5.8%. No other parish in Louisiana or county in Texas or Florida individually has over 5.0% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Maison has written or assumed policies in 156 of the 254 counties that comprise the State of Texas, and in 28 of the 67 counties in Florida.\nIf we are not able to significantly expand to other states, we may risk higher reinsurance costs and greater loss experience with storm activity occurring in Texas, Florida and Louisiana.\nOur strategy to expand into other states, including Florida, may not succeed.\nOur strategy for growth includes potentially entering into new states. This strategy could divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot predict whether we will be able to enter new states or whether applicable state regulators will grant Maison a license to do business in such states. We cannot know if we will realize the anticipated benefits of operating in new states or if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such expansion. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Although we have received authorization from the FOIR via a consent order to write personal lines business in Florida, the order stipulates that we maintain catastrophe reinsurance at such levels as deemed appropriate by the FOIR. Should we not be able to comply with these regulations our expansion into Florida may not succeed.\nWe have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results if they occur.\nWe offer full peril protection and wind/hail-only insurance policies that cover homeowners and owners of manufactured homes, as well as dwelling fire policies for owners of property rented to others, for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes. We are therefore subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, flood, fire, and by man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our policyholders are currently concentrated in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. These states are subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms. For example, in late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Louisiana and Texas, impacting many of our policyholders. This event primarily impacted our Texas policyholders along with a relatively smaller number of Louisiana policyholders. We expect our total gross incurred losses for Hurricane Harvey to be approximately $27,000,000, and expect to recover $22,000,000 from our reinsurers from this event. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such an event takes place. Therefore, a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes, could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur results may fluctuate based on many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nThe insurance business has historically been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable underwriting profits. An increase in premium levels is often offset over time by an increasing supply of insurance capacity in the form of capital provided by new entrants and existing insurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks and any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance business significantly. These factors may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile.\nWe cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we are not able to write insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased competition could adversely impact our results and growth.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual companies, underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and name recognition than us. While our principal competitors cannot be easily classified, Maison considers its primary competing insurers to be: ASI Lloyds, American Integrity Insurance Company, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, United Property & Casualty, First Community Insurance Company, Southern Fidelity Insurance, Safepoint Insurance Company, Imperial F&C Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, Access Home Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Federated National Insurance Company, and Centauri Specialty Insurance Company. As we write both full-peril as well as wind/hail only personal lines insurance throughout the states of Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, our principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies. Competition for any one account may come from very large national firms, smaller regional companies or companies that write insurance only in Florida, Louisiana and/or Texas. We compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, availability of coverage desired by customers, underwriting criteria and quality of service to our agents and insureds. We may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future.\nIn addition, industry developments could further increase competition in our industry, including:\n\u25cf an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt to enter the insurance business as a result of better pricing and/or terms;\n\u25cf the creation or expansion of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage;\n\u25cf changing practices caused by the Internet, which has led to greater competition in the insurance business;\n\u25cf changes to the regulatory climate in the states in which we operate; and\n\u25cf the passage of federal proposals for an optional federal charter that would allow some competing insurers to operate under regulations different or less stringent than those applicable to our insurance subsidiary.\nThese developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive. If competition limits our ability to write new business at adequate rates, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nIf our actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe record liabilities, which are referred to as reserves, for specific claims incurred and reported as well as reserves for claims incurred but not reported. The estimates of losses for reported claims are established on a case-by-case basis. Such estimates are based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim. Reserves for reported claims encapsulate our total estimate of the cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of the claim, and may be adjusted for differences between costs as originally estimated and the costs as re-estimated or incurred. Reserves for incurred but not reported claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Although management believes that amounts included in the consolidated financial statements for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are adequate, future changes in loss development, favorable or unfavorable, may occur. Due to these uncertainties, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $4.5 million were comprised of incurred but not reported reserves of $2.4 million and known case reserves of $2.1 million.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These changes may have a material adverse effect on our business by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and/or renewed, and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe lack of availability of third party adjusters during periods of high claim frequency, or the failure of third party adjusters to properly evaluate claims or the failure of our claims handling administrator to pay claims fairly could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe have outsourced a portion of our claim adjusting function to third party adjusters and therefore rely on these third party adjusters to accurately evaluate claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of their claims representatives, the culture of their respective claims organizations, the effectiveness of their management and their ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support their claims functions. In periods following catastrophic events, or during other periods of high claims frequency, the availability of third party adjusters may be limited. This lack of availability may result in an inability to pay our claims in a timely manner and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, MMI functions as our claims administrator and authorizes payment based on recommendations from third party adjusters; any failure on the part of the third party adjusters to recommend payment on claims fairly could lead to material litigation, or other extra-contractual liabilities, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to expand the number of insurance policies we write, the kinds of insurance products we offer and the geographic markets in which we do business, all balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. Our existing sources of funds include possible sales of our securities and our earnings from operations and investments. Unexpected catastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes and other storms experienced in Florida, Louisiana and Texas in recent years, may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt our growth strategy in these and other coastal states we may enter while we deploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims, unless we are able to raise additional capital.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our company\u2019s capital and surplus, premiums and loss reserves in various investment vehicles.\nA portion of our expected income is likely to be generated by the investment of our cash reserves in money market funds, bonds, and other investment vehicles. The amount of income generated from these investments is a function of our investment policy, available investment opportunities, and the amount of invested assets. If we experience larger than expected losses, our invested assets may need to be liquidated in order to provide the cash needed to pay current claims, which may result in lower investment income. We periodically review our investment policy in light of our then-current circumstances, including liquidity needs, and available investment opportunities. Fluctuating interest rates and other economic factors make it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of investment income that will actually be realized. We may realize losses on our investments, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe may experience financial exposure from climate change.\nOur financial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with increasing occurrences of weather-related events striking the states in which we insure risks. Our maximum reinsurance coverage amount is determined by subjecting our homeowner exposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every 100 years. 100 years is used as a measure of the relative size of a storm as compared to a storm expected to occur once every 250 years, which would be larger, or conversely, a storm expected to occur once every 50 years, which would be smaller. We assess the appropriateness of the level of reinsurance we purchase by giving consideration to our own risk appetite, the opinions of independent rating agencies as well as the requirements of state regulators. Our amount of losses we retain (referred to as our deductible) in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions and surplus preservation.\nIndustry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss, rising jury awards, and the escalation of loss severity, may contribute to increased costs and to the deterioration of the reserves of our insurance subsidiary.\nThe propensity of policyholders and third party claimants to litigate, the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the size of awards may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiary inadequate for current and future losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\nOur ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business may be negatively affected by the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\nWe are not rated by A.M. Best, although we currently have a Financial Stability Rating (FSR) of \u2018A\u2019 Exceptional from Demotech, Inc. We have never been reviewed by A.M. Best and do not intend to seek a rating from A.M. Best. Unlike Demotech, A.M. Best may penalize companies that are highly leveraged, i.e. that utilize reinsurance to support premium writings. We do not plan to give up revenues or efficiency of size as a means to qualify for an acceptable A.M. Best rating. While our Demotech rating has proved satisfactory to date in attracting an acceptable amount of business from independent agents, some independent agents are reluctant to do business with a company that is not rated by A.M. Best. As a result, not having an A.M. Best rating may prevent us from expanding our business into certain independent agencies or limit our access to credit from certain financial institutions, which may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies.\nAn adverse rating from Demotech may negatively impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies, or obtain adequate reinsurance, which could harm our business.\nAlthough our insurance subsidiary company currently has a Financial Stability Rating of \u2018A\u2019 Exceptional from Demotech, Inc., the withdrawal of our rating could limit or prevent us from writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, from competing with insurers who have higher ratings, or from obtaining adequate reinsurance. The withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance policies may no longer be acceptable to the secondary marketplace or mortgage lenders. Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could prevent independent agencies from selling and servicing our insurance policies.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe rely on independent agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nWhile we currently obtain some of our policies through the assumption of policies from TWIA and LA and FL Citizens, we still require the cooperation and consent of our network of independent agents. We rely on these independent agents to be the primary source for our property insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019 business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions are not competitive, we may find it difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products, or may receive less attractive business than our competitors. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell would adversely affect our revenues.\nWe face a risk of non-availability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to write business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use, and we expect to continue to use, reinsurance to help manage our exposure to catastrophic losses due to various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fire and man-made events. The availability and cost of reinsurance are each subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control which can affect business volume and profitability. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance coverage, to obtain additional reinsurance coverage in the event our current reinsurance coverage is exhausted by a catastrophic event, or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts or at acceptable rates. Similar risks exist whether we are seeking to replace coverage terminated during the applicable coverage period or to renew or replace coverage upon its expiration. Each of the FOIR, LDI and TDI require that we maintain a minimum level of reinsurance coverage as a condition of writing insurance in their jurisdictions. Should we not be able to maintain this coverage, these regulators may revoke our license to write insurance. We can provide no assurance that we can obtain sufficient reinsurance to cover losses resulting from one or more storms in the future, or that we can obtain such reinsurance in a timely or cost-effective manner. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to obtain new reinsurance coverage, either our net exposure to risk would increase or, if we are unwilling to accept an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite. Either increasing our net exposure to risk or reducing the amount of risk we underwrite may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAlthough reinsurers are liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we purchase, we remain primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks that we reinsure. Accordingly, our reinsurance agreements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. As a result, we are subject to risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers, including the risks that: (a) our reinsurers may dispute some of our reinsurance claims based on contract terms, and we may ultimately receive partial or no payment, or (b) the amount of losses that reinsurers incur related to worldwide catastrophes may materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and cause them to default on their obligations. While we will attempt to manage these risks through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements, financial strength ratings, credit reviews and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. Further, while we may require collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions, balances generally are not collateralized because it has not always been standard business practice to require security for balances due. As a result, our exposure to credit risk may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe use actuarially driven catastrophe models to provide us with risk management guidelines.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we run our exposures in an actuarially driven model that uses past storm data to predict future loss of certain events reoccurring based upon the location and other data of our insured properties. These models, which are provided by independent third parties, can produce wide ranging results within the states we do business. We use these models along with the advice of our reinsurance intermediary to select the amount and type of reinsurance to mitigate the loss of capital from catastrophic wind events. These models are used to develop future theoretical loss scenarios, and there are risks that the amount of reinsurance purchased will be insufficient to cover the ultimate catastrophic wind event. Furthermore, the probability of the occurrence of a catastrophic event may be larger than that predicted by the models.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure including:\n\u25cf utilizing restrictive underwriting criteria;\n\u25cf carefully evaluating and monitoring the terms and conditions of our policies;\n\u25cf focusing on our risk aggregations by geographic zones; and\n\u25cf ceding insurance risk to reinsurance companies.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics. An event or series of events may result in loss levels which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nVarious provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been drafted to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of endorsements to our policies that limit exposure to known risks, including but not limited to exclusions relating to flood coverage for homes in close proximity to the coast line. In addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us or to our claims handling administrator and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would increase our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMaison is subject to an independent third party rating agency and must maintain certain rating levels to continue to write much of its current and future policies.\nIn the event that Maison fails to maintain an \u201cA\u201d rating given by a rating agency acceptable to both our insurance agents and our insureds\u2019 home lenders, it will be unable to continue to write much of its current and future insurance policies. In order to maintain this rating, among several factors, Maison must maintain certain minimum capital and surplus. The loss of such an acceptable rating may lead to a significant decline in our premium volume and adversely affect the results of our operations. Demotech, Inc. affirmed our Financial Stability Rating of \u201cA\u201d on December 8, 2017. This \u201cExceptional\u201d rating continues as long as we continue to satisfy their requirements, including improving underwriting results, reporting risk-based capital and other financial measures, submitting quarterly statutory financial statements within 45 days of the period end and submitting annual statutory financial statements within 60 days of the period end.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and a smaller reporting company under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Both emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are exempt from the requirement to include the auditor\u2019s report of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and we will continue to be exempt until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company. Regardless of our qualification status, we have implemented substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of Nasdaq, among other items. Maintaining these internal controls is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, or violations of Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWhile we currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations, we cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not make our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose emerging growth and smaller reporting company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\nThe JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies and the SEC\u2019s rules permit smaller reporting companies like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth or smaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth or smaller reporting company, we are permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say on pay, say on frequency, and say on golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2019, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act. In addition, we will continue to be a smaller reporting company until we have more than $75 million in public float (based on our common equity) measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based on our common equity), annual revenues of more than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.\nUntil such time that we lose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status, it is unclear if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements.\nWe have directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for our controlling stockholders, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of our having previously spun off from KFSI, we have directors who also serve as directors and executive officers of KFSI, 1347 Advisors, LLC (\u201c1347 Advisors\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFSI, Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFH) (\u201cAtlas\u201d), and Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (\u201cLimbach\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, KFSI and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock and also warrants and performance shares to acquire an additional 23.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We also have directors who serve as executive officers and/or directors of FGI and its affiliates, which together, as of December 31, 2017, beneficially owned approximately 36.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, FGI and its affiliates beneficially own 4.9% of our outstanding shares of 8.00% cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur executive officers and members of our Company\u2019s Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders; likewise, persons who serve in similar capacities at KFSI, 1347 Advisors, Atlas, and Limbach and FGI have fiduciary duties to those companies\u2019 investors. We may find, though, the potential for a conflict of interest if our Company and one or more of these other companies pursue acquisitions, investments and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of us. Our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles may, as a result, have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Furthermore, our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles own stock options, shares of common stock and other securities in some of these entities. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and these other entities. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with or participate jointly in investments with KFSI, 1347 Advisors, Atlas, Limbach, or FGI or its affiliates. We may create new situations in the future in which our directors serve as directors or executive officers in future investment holdings of such entities.\nOur information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for our underwriting business, as well as to handle our policy administration processes (such as the printing and mailing of our policies, endorsements, and renewal notices, etc.). Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information systems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event one or more of our facilities cannot be accessed due to a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as computer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely basis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely manner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations also depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. From time to time, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business.\nThe development and expansion of our business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced computer and data processing systems. The failure of these systems to function as planned could slow our growth and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.\nWe believe that our independent agents will play a key role in our efforts to increase the number of voluntary policies written by our insurance subsidiary. We utilize various policy administration, rating, and issuance systems. Internet disruptions or system failures of our current policy administration, policy rating and policy issuance system could affect our future business volume and results of operations. In addition, a security breach of our computer systems could damage our reputation or result in liability. We retain confidential information regarding our business dealings and our customers in our computer systems. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or other disruptive problems. In addition, we could be subject to liability if hackers were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate customer\u2019s personal data or other confidential information.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAny failure on the part of our third-party policy administration processor could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nWe outsource our policy administration process to an unaffiliated, independent third party service provider. Any failure on the part of such third party to properly handle our policy administration process could lead to material litigation, extra-contractual liabilities, regulatory action, and undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our Board of Directors and senior management team has overall responsibility for our management and not all of our directors and members of our senior management team have prior experience in operating a public company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and Nasdaq obligations. Management\u2019s past experience may not be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Nasdaq rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to continually commit significant resources, maintain staff and provide additional management oversight. In addition, sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a public company, we incur significant annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, accounting, legal and administrative personnel, auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We also incur higher costs for director and officer liability insurance. Any of these factors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional costs once we lose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status.\nWe may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected growth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other developments. If we had to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur acquisition strategy may not succeed.\nOur strategy for growth includes, among other things, acquisition transactions. This strategy could divert management\u2019s attention, or, if implemented, create difficulties including the integration of operations and the retention of employees, and the contingent and latent risks associated with our transaction partner. The risks associated with the acquisition of a smaller insurance company include:\n\u25cf inadequacy of reserves for losses and loss expenses and other unanticipated liabilities;\n\u25cf quality of their data and underwriting processes;\n\u25cf the need to supplement management with additional experienced personnel;\n\u25cf conditions imposed by regulatory agencies that make the realization of cost-savings through integration of operations more difficult;\n\u25cf the requirement for regulatory approval for certain acquisitions;\n\u25cf a need for additional capital that was not anticipated at the time of the acquisition; and\n\u25cf the use of a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time.\nWe may be unable to identify and complete a future transaction on terms favorable to us. We may not know if we will realize the anticipated benefits of a completed transaction and there may be substantial unanticipated costs associated with the transaction. In addition, a future transaction may result in tax consequences at either or both the stockholder and company level, potentially dilutive issuances of our securities, the incurrence of additional debt and the recognition of potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Each of these factors could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies will require an additional investment of our capital resources in the future.\nFrequent technological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards all influence the insurance business. The Internet, for example, is increasingly used to transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate business-to-business information exchange and transactions. We believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future. We have not determined, however, the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require, which may result in short-term, unexpected interruptions to our business, or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price and/or efficiency, as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of our operations and the financial condition of our insurance subsidiary depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data, develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas, closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and thereby price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze such data;\n\u25cf uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u25cf our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u25cf changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices and restoration costs; and\n\u25cf legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nBecause we have assumed a substantial portion of our current policies from LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA, our rates are based, to a certain extent, on the rates charged by those insurers. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we have assumed, our rates must be equal to or less than the rates previously charged by the state-run insurer. If LA or FL Citizens reduces its rates, we must reduce our rates to keep them equivalent to or less than their rates; however, if LA or FL Citizens increases its rates, we may not automatically increase our rates. Additionally, absent certain circumstances, we must continue to provide coverage to the policyholders that we assume from LA or FL Citizens if we have underwritten the same policyholder for a period of three consecutive years. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we have assumed from TWIA, our rates must be no greater than 115% of premiums charged by TWIA for comparable coverage. Additionally, we must continue to provide coverage to the policyholders under those policies that we have assumed from TWIA for a minimum of three successive renewal periods. If we underprice our risks, it may negatively affect our profit margins and if we overprice risks, it could reduce our customer retention, sales volume and competitiveness. Either event may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our insurance subsidiary.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nCurrent operating resources are necessary to develop future new insurance products.\nWe currently intend to expand our product offerings by underwriting additional insurance products and programs, and marketing them through our distribution network. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate justifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products will also require regulatory approval, further increasing our costs and potentially affecting the speed with which we will be able to pursue new market opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful bringing new insurance products to our marketplace.\nAs an insurance holding company, we are currently subject to regulation by the States of Louisiana, Texas, and Florida and in the future may become subject to regulation by certain other states or a federal regulator.\nAll states regulate insurance holding company systems. State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company in the holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends, and consolidated tax allocation agreements. Insurance holding company regulations generally provide that transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates must be fair and equitable, allocated between the parties in accordance with customary accounting practices, and fully disclosed in the records of the respective parties. Many types of transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates, such as transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system, may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities. If we are unable to provide the required materials or obtain the requisite prior approval for a specific transaction, we may be precluded from taking the actions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiary currently operates in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. In the future, our insurance subsidiary may become authorized to transact business in other states and therefore will become subject to the laws and regulatory requirements of those states. These regulations may vary from state to state, and certain states may have regulations which conflict with the regulations of other states. Currently, the federal government\u2019s role in regulating or dictating the policies of insurance companies is limited. However, Congress, from time to time, considers proposals that would increase the role of the federal government in insurance regulation, either in addition to or in lieu of state regulation. The impact of any future federal insurance regulation on our insurance operations is unclear and may adversely impact our business or competitive position.\nOur insurance subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation which may reduce our profitability or inhibit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated and supervised. Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, is subject to the supervision and regulation of the state in which it is domiciled and the states in which it does business. Such supervision and regulation is primarily designed to protect policyholders rather than stockholders. These regulations are generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things:\n\u25cf the content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;\n\u25cf the amount of premiums the insurer may write in relation to its surplus;\n\u25cf the amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;\n\u25cf approval of insurance company acquisitions;\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n\u25cf participation in guaranty funds and other statutorily-created markets or organizations;\n\u25cf business operations and claims practices;\n\u25cf approval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\u25cf standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u25cf licensing of insurers and their products;\n\u25cf licensing and appointment of agents and managing general agents;\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u25cf restrictions on the ability of our insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends to us;\n\u25cf restrictions on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n\u25cf restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\n\u25cf requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u25cf requiring certain methods of accounting;\n\u25cf periodic examinations of our operations and finances;\n\u25cf prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and\n\u25cf requiring reserves as required by statutory accounting rules.\nThe LDI and regulators in other jurisdictions where our insurance company subsidiary operates or may operate conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, information relating to and notices and approvals of transactions with affiliated parties, and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators. In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our business or otherwise penalize us. Any such outcome may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nFinally, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nMaison is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nMaison is subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of Texas, Florida and Louisiana (and other states where we may eventually conduct business). The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require Maison to report its results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined by applying the NAIC\u2019s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\nIn addition, Maison is required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples of its capital and surplus. Maison could exceed these ratios if its volume increases faster than anticipated or if its surplus declines due to catastrophic and/or non-catastrophic losses, excessive underwriting and/or operational expenses.\nAny failure by Maison to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations imposed by the laws of the states in which Maison operates could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nShould our retention rate be less than anticipated, our future results will be negatively impacted.\nWe make assumptions about the rate at which our existing policies will renew for the purpose of projecting premiums written and the amount of reinsurance which we obtain based upon the projected amount of future exposure. If the actual exposure renewed is less than anticipated, our premiums written would be adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may purchase more reinsurance than may be appropriate given the actual amount of coverage in force.\nHolders of our outstanding shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\nAs of March 26, 2018, we have issued and outstanding 700,000 shares of preferred stock designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $17.5 million, and annual dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are approximately $1.4 million. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of lawfully available funds for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends from and including the original issue date at the rate of 8.00% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share). Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment. This would reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to designate and issue additional preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares similar to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. Because our decision to issue additional securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interests.\nWe depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate and transfer funds to meet our financial obligations.\nOur operations are substantially conducted through our subsidiaries, Maison, MMI and ClaimCor. As an insurance holding company, we are dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiary companies to serve as operating capital. The ability of Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, to pay dividends to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed under Louisiana insurance law, which is the state of domicile for Maison. Dividends payments to us may also be restricted pursuant to a consent agreement entered into with the LDI and the FOIR as a condition of our licensure in each state. Interest payments on the surplus notes issued to us by Maison are also subject to the prior approval of the LDI. Our other subsidiary companies collect the majority of their revenue through their affiliation with Maison. Our subsidiary company, MMI, earns commission income from Maison for underwriting, policy administration, claims handling, and other services provided to Maison. Our subsidiary company, ClaimCor, earns claims adjusting income for adjusting certain of the claims of Maison\u2019s policyholders. While dividend payments from our other subsidiaries are not restricted under insurance law, the underlying contracts between Maison and our other subsidiary companies are regulated by, and subject to the approval of, insurance regulators.\nAs a result of the regulatory and contractual restrictions described above, we may not be able to receive dividends from Maison or our other subsidiaries, which would affect our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock. Under Delaware corporate law, we are generally restricted to paying dividends from either Company surplus or from net income from the current or preceding fiscal year so long as the payment of the dividends does not reduce the value of the Company\u2019s net assets below the stated value of the Company\u2019s outstanding preferred shares. Our ability to make dividend payments on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock, is therefore dependent on dividends and other distributions or payments from our subsidiaries. The ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us depends upon the availability of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets and other capital-raising activities. We cannot be certain of the future availability of such distributions and the lack of any such distributions may adversely affect our ability to make dividend payments on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our underwriters and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations, which could adversely affect our results. Because we have relatively few employees, the loss of, or failure to attract, key personnel could also significantly impede the financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives of our company. Our success depends to a substantial extent on the ability and experience of our senior management. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employees. We may not be successful in doing so, because the competition for experienced personnel in the insurance industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify, hire and retain adequately qualified personnel. We do not have employment agreements with our employees. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Congress recently passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by the President on December 22, 2017. One of the key features of the legislation is a reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%. Due to this reduction, the Company has incurred an initial charge to earnings to write off a portion of the net deferred tax asset position recognized in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, future operating results would be taxed at the lower rate. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiary has also incurred a charge associated with the write off of its deferred tax asset, which has resulted in a decrease in its capital and surplus under statutory accounting principles for insurance companies. If corporate Federal income tax rates were reduced, federal and/or state legislation might be enacted to help offset the decrease in tax revenue to the government. Such legislation might reduce or eliminate certain tax advantages that are currently beneficial to the Company, including tax-exempt interest on municipal securities, the dividends received deduction and certain tax credits. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company\u2019s investments might be adversely impacted. Under the new tax law, the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset decreased $350,000 on a consolidated basis to $70,000 as of December 31, 2017 from $420,000 as of December 31, 2016 and decreased $284,000, on a regulatory basis, in the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiary.", "PERMNO": 14607, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PIH"}
