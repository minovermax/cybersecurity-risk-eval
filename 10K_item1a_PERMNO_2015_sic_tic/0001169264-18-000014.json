{"cik": "1169264", "company": "SYNIVERSE HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If these events were to occur, we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on our indebtedness, including the Syniverse Notes. Information contained in this section may be considered \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of certain qualifications regarding such statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nSystem failures, delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business, cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide reliable services to our customers. Our operations could be interrupted or degraded by any damage to or failure of:\n\u2022\nour computer software or hardware, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 computer software or hardware;\n\u2022\nour network, our customers\u2019 networks or our suppliers\u2019 networks; and\n\u2022\nour connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties.\nOur systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\npower loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications and utility failures;\n\u2022\nhurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\na terrorist attack in the U.S. or in another country in which we operate;\n\u2022\ninterruption of service arising from facility migrations, resulting from changes in business operations including acquisitions and planned data center migrations;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses or software defects;\n\u2022\nloss or misuse of proprietary information or customer data that compromises security, confidentiality or integrity; and\n\u2022\nerrors by our employees or third-party service providers.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, our network nodes and other systems experience temporary outages. As a means of ensuring continuity in the services we provide to customers, we have invested in system redundancies, proactive alarm monitoring and other back-up infrastructure, though we cannot assure you that we will be able to re-route our services over our back-up facilities and provide continuous service to customers in all circumstances without material degradation. Because many of our services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on, including that of our customers and vendors, could disrupt or degrade the operation of our network and the provision of our services, result in the loss of current and potential customers and expose us to potential liability under our customer contracts.\nWe do not control the networks over which many of our services are transmitted, and a failure in the operations of such networks could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform is dependent on the reliability of the sophisticated and complex networks of others in the mobile ecosystem, as well as our ability to deliver services across such networks at prices that enable us to realize a profit. These networks could fail for a variety of reasons, including new technology incompatibility, the degradation of network performance under the strain of too many mobile consumers using the network, a general failure from natural disaster or a political or regulatory shut-down. Individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs or engage in denial of service attacks or other similar activities could also attack mobile networks and the devices that run on those networks. If a network upon which we rely should fail for any reason, we would not be able to effectively provide our services to our customers using that network. This in turn could hurt our reputation and cause us to lose significant revenue.\nOur reliance on third-party providers for communications software, hardware and infrastructure exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control.\nOur success depends on software, equipment, network connectivity and infrastructure hosting services supplied by our vendors and customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase the necessary software, equipment and services from these vendors on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure service availability with these vendors and customers, we may lose customers during any disruption or degradation in services and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative supplier services, migration of equipment or services or incur additional capital expenditure costs.\nOur business also depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned and managed by third parties, including our vendors and customers, that is used to deliver our services. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure and whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their software, equipment and services to meet our and our customers\u2019 evolving requirements. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our services. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future, our operations could be severely impacted. In addition, rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to industry consolidation. This consolidation may cause the availability, pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could lengthen the amount of time it takes to deliver the services that we use, in particular for those services for which we need access to mobile operators\u2019 networks in order to deliver.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information technology, or \u201cIT\u201d systems, including from cybersecurity threats, could damage our reputation, harm our operating results and result in significant liabilities.\nOur IT systems are subject to security risks and we may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks. Our services require that we electronically receive, process, store and transmit customer information, which includes certain sensitive consumer and end-user data. As a result, the proper functioning of our IT systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. We believe the risk that a security breach could seriously harm our business is high and is likely to increase as we expand our technology and network footprint. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data (either directly or through our vendors and customers) and other electronic security breaches. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure or those of our third parties may be vulnerable to such cyber incidents. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated or misappropriated financial data, theft of our intellectual property or other confidential information (including of our customers, vendors and employees), liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. In addition, if any information about our customers, including payment information, were the subject of a successful cybersecurity attack against us, we could be subject to litigation or other claims by the affected customers. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement the security measures we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. If our services are perceived as not being secure, our strategy to be a leading provider of technology solutions to the wireless ecosystem may be adversely impacted.\nOur information systems include proprietary systems developed and maintained by us and IT systems of third parties. Although our IT systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist, our IT systems or those of third parties whom we depend upon are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized\naccess, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical proprietary or third-party IT systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, including as a result of system upgrades and transitions, our ability to operate our business would be adversely affected.\nIf we do not adapt to rapid technological or other changes in the industries we serve, we could lose customers or market share.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change and changing customer demands, such as the evolution of LTE and 5G networks, the replacement of CDMA networks and the evolution of the OTT ecosystem that may bypass or compete with MNO networks for certain services, such as messaging. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the features, functionality, reliability and responsiveness of our existing services and by successfully developing, introducing and marketing new features, services and applications to meet changing customer needs. Significant technological changes or changes in the needs of our customers have in the past, and are likely to continue to in the future, make certain of our services obsolete, such as our CDMA services. In addition, technological and other changes may result in a shift in end-user preferences or a decline in reliance on the mobile ecosystem, including, but not limited to, further advances in web-based personal communication. We cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way to adequately meet them. Our failure to do so would impair our ability to compete, retain customers or maintain our financial performance. Our future revenues and profits will depend, in part, on our ability to sell to new market participants.\nOur new services, such as our data analytics, business intelligence, mobile engagement, anti-fraud, policy and charging, IPX and Enterprise A2P messaging solutions, may not be widely adopted by our current or targeted customers.\nIn order to continue to meet the rapidly evolving needs of our customers and their end-users, we must continue to develop new services that are responsive to those needs. In particular, we have recently begun to expand our offerings of data analytics, business intelligence, mobile engagement, anti-fraud, policy and charging, IPX and Enterprise A2P messaging solutions to our customers. Our ability to realize the benefits of these and other new services depends, in part, on the adoption and utilization of such services and solutions by our customers, and we cannot be certain that existing or targeted customers will adopt such offerings in the near term or at all. If we are not successful in our efforts to develop and monetize new services, including data analytics and business intelligence solutions, our prospects, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of any of our major customers would negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur 10 largest customers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 50% and 51% of our reported revenues in the aggregate, respectively. We expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues going forward. Since our major customers represent such a large part of our business, the loss of any of our major customers or any services provided to these customers would negatively impact our business. Any non-renewal of contracts with these customers could materially reduce our revenues.\nOur failure to achieve or sustain desired pricing levels or to offset price reductions with increased transaction volumes, could impact our ability to maintain profitability or positive cash flow.\nCompetition and industry consolidation have resulted in pricing pressure in certain circumstances. In addition, regulatory or other market forces have lowered the retail prices our customers can charge for roaming services which has increased pricing pressure for our services that support roaming. We expect this pricing pressure to continue in the future. This pricing pressure could negatively impact the selling price of our services at the time of contract renewal or cause our customers to otherwise request pricing reductions or other concessions. For example, consolidation in the wireless services industry in the U.S. over the past several years has given some of our customers increased leverage in pricing negotiations. Our competitors or our customers\u2019 in-house solutions may also provide services at a lower cost, significantly increasing pricing pressures on us. While lower retail prices may lead to increased volumes as end users are more willing to use international roaming services, we may not be able to offset the effects of price reductions with volume increases or the introduction of new services.\nFuture consolidation among, or network buildouts by, our customers may cause us to lose transaction volume and reduce our prices, which would negatively impact our financial performance.\nIn the past, consolidation among our customers has at times caused us to lose transaction volume and to reduce prices. In the future, our transaction volume and pricing may decline for similar reasons. Such consolidation activities may take the form of business combinations, strategic partnerships, or other business arrangements between the operators. In addition, our customers have in the past, and may in the future, buildout their networks which could result in decreased transaction volumes as their home network expands.\nWe may not be able to expand our customer base to make up for any revenue declines if we lose customers or if our transaction volumes decline as a result of consolidation activities. Our attempts to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on particular customers may not be successful.\nMost of our customer contracts do not provide for minimum payments at or near our historical levels of revenues from these customers.\nAlthough some of our customer contracts require our customers to make minimum payments to us, these minimum payments are substantially less than the revenues that we have historically earned from these customers. While our contracts are generally subject to a multi-year term, the amount of revenue produced by the contract is not guaranteed. If our customers decide for any reason not to continue to purchase services from us at current levels or at current prices, or not to renew their contracts with us, our revenues would decline.\nThe market for our services is intensely competitive, including from our customers as they look to develop in-house alternatives to our services.\nWe compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced pricing, reduced gross and operating margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. We face competition from large, well-funded providers of similar services, including existing communications, billing and technology companies. We are aware of major internet service providers, software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing services that will compete with one or more of the services we offer. In addition, we believe that certain of our customers may choose to internally develop and deploy certain functionality currently provided by our services. In recent years, we have experienced a loss of revenue streams from certain of our services as some of our customers have decided to meet their needs for these services in-house or by directly connecting with others in the mobile ecosystem.\nWe expect that competition for our services will remain intense in the near term and that our primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market. Certain of our current and potential competitors, including our customers, have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in end-user requirements than we can.\nOur continued expansion into international markets is subject to uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur growth strategy contemplates continued expansion of our operations into foreign jurisdictions. These international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S., including in order to comply with local currency laws;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign import, export and related regulatory controls on trade;\n\u2022\ntax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls, taxes upon repatriation or other restrictions;\n\u2022\nreputational harm or other adverse consequences due to our operations in jurisdictions subject to the OFAC laws and regulations. See \u201cWe currently conduct limited business operations and expect to continue such operations in countries targeted by U.S. and E.U. economic sanctions;\u201d\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries, including recruiting and hiring adequate and competent personnel and maintaining our standards, controls, information systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nthe risk that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including for example TRAI\u2019s recent rate reduction for number portability services in India; and\n\u2022\nthe potential difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 46.4% of our total revenue was generated outside of the U.S. as compared to 43.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could result in higher costs or reduced revenues for our international operations.\nPolitical instability in certain countries in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nWe operate in nearly 200 countries across the globe, including in countries and regions subject to political unrest and instability. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a foreign government and the U.S. or our company may adversely affect our operations. Such instability must be carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. These risks are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act (the \u201cUK Act\u201d). The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. The UK Act prohibits us from making payments to private citizens as well as government officials. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel to comply with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct limited business operations and expect to continue such operations in countries targeted by United States and European Union economic sanctions.\nOFAC enforces certain laws and regulations (\u201cOFAC Sanctions\u201d) that impose restrictions upon U.S. nationals, U.S. permanent residents, persons located in the U.S., or entities organized under the laws of a U.S. jurisdiction (collectively, \u201cU.S. Persons\u201d), upon business conducted in whole or in part in the U.S., and, in some instances, upon foreign entities owned or controlled by U.S. Persons, with respect to activities or transactions with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals that are the subject of OFAC Sanctions (\u201cU.S. Sanctions Targets\u201d). U.S. Persons are also prohibited from facilitating such activities or transactions conducted by others. Similarly, the E.U. and its member nations enforce certain laws and regulations (\u201cE.U. Sanctions\u201d) that impose restrictions upon nationals of E.U. member states, persons located within E.U. member states,\nentities incorporated or constituted under the law of an E.U. member state, or business conducted in whole or in part in E.U. member states with respect to activities or transactions with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals that are the subject of E.U. Sanctions (\u201cE.U. Sanctions Targets\u201d and together with U.S. Sanctions Targets, \u201cSanctions Targets\u201d). E.U. persons are also generally prohibited from activities that promote such activities or transactions conducted by others. Additionally, U.S. law authorizes the imposition of various disabilities (\u201cU.S. Secondary Sanctions\u201d) on non-U.S. companies that engage in certain specified types of business involving Iran or Cuba. We engage in limited business activities in countries that are Sanctions Targets, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. Our activities and investments in Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba in the aggregate accounted for approximately 0.2% of our consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to engage in these limited business activities in countries that are deemed Sanctions Targets over the foreseeable future. Although we believe that OFAC and E.U. Sanctions under their current terms do not prohibit our current activities, and that our current activities will not cause us to be subject to potential U.S. Secondary Sanctions under current U.S. law, our reputation may be adversely affected and investors may divest their investments in us as a result of internal investment policies or may decide for reputational reasons to divest such investments. In addition, the sanctions laws and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to discontinue or limit our current activities involving Iran, Syria, Sudan or Cuba, or involving other countries, individuals or entities that are not currently designated as Sanctions Targets. We cannot assure you that the foregoing will not occur or that such occurrence will not have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities.\nWe conduct business in both domestic and international markets with complex and evolving tax rules, which subjects us to taxation related risks.\nSome tax jurisdictions in which we operate have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of inter-company services, cross-border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on the taxes to which we are subject, including income tax, value-added tax and transfer tax. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax audits and may be required to pay additional taxes, interest or penalties should the taxing authority assert different interpretations, or different allocations or valuations of our services. There is a risk, if one or more taxing authorities significantly disagrees with our interpretations, allocations or valuations, that any additional taxes, interest or penalties which may result could be material and could reduce our income and cash flow from our international subsidiaries.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code which could have an overall unfavorable effect on our prospective cash tax obligations as well as our effective income tax rate.\nWe may not be able to receive or retain licenses or authorizations that may be required for us to sell our services internationally.\nThe sales and marketing of our services internationally are subject to the U.S. Export Control regime and similar regulations in other countries. In the U.S., items of a commercial nature are generally subject to regulatory control by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security and to Export Administration Regulations, and other international trade regulations may apply as well. In the future, regulatory authorities may require us to obtain export licenses or other authorizations to export our services abroad, depending upon the nature of items being exported, as well as the country to which the export is to be made. We cannot assure you that any of our applications for export licenses or other authorizations will be granted or approved. Furthermore, the export license/export authorization process is often time-consuming. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.\nThe costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses and technologies could impede our future growth, diminish our competitiveness and harm our operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we consider selective acquisitions of complementary businesses. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks we currently and will continue to face with respect to acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ngreater than expected costs, management time and effort involved in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and difficulty in maintaining our standards, controls, information systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nentering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience;\n\u2022\nacquiring intellectual property which may be subject to various challenges from others;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the services and personnel of any acquisition into our operations;\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve expected synergies, business growth opportunities, cost savings and other benefits we anticipate;\n\u2022\na need to incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses;\n\u2022\nincurrence of liabilities and claims arising out of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen integration difficulties that may cause service disruptions.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the United States or in other major global markets could negatively impact our financial performance.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions may exist globally, or in one or more regions, due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the decreased availability of credit resulting from slower economic activity, concerns about inflation and deflation, volatility in energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending. Currency fluctuations and adverse business conditions in some emerging markets have impacted profitability and credit availability for certain of our customers. In addition, geopolitical factors in the Middle East, Africa and Venezuela have created economic and political uncertainties that continue to impact worldwide markets. These conditions make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause further slow spending on our services. Furthermore, during challenging economic times such as recession or economic slowdown, our customers or vendors may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments or provide services to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our cash collections would be negatively impacted. Any future economic downturn may reduce our revenues or our percentage of revenue growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the telecommunications industry. If the economy or the markets in which we operate do not improve from their current condition or if they deteriorate, our customers or potential customers could reduce or further delay their use of our services, which would adversely impact our revenues and ultimately our profitability. In addition, we may record additional charges related to the restructuring of our business and the impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived assets, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected.\nDemand for our services is driven primarily by wireless voice and data traffic. Changes in end-user usage patterns could be affected in any recession or economic downturn in the U.S. or any other country where we do business and could negatively impact the number of transactions processed and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nBecause some of our services are used to collect and store personal information of our customers\u2019 employees or customers, privacy concerns could result in additional costs and liability to us or inhibit sales of our services.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the U.S., European nations and in other countries where we offer our services. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently complex and evolving, and we believe it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the U.S., these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. For example, the E.U. has issued the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which will be effective May 25, 2018 and will apply to anyone doing business in Europe. In general GDPR sets a higher bar for privacy compliance, including new data subject rights (such as the right to be forgotten, the right to portability and the right to restriction of data), new mandatory security breach notification requirements, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments and extensive record keeping requirements. Failure to comply with GDPR can have significant consequences with fines up to 4% of global annual revenue. In addition, the Company may incur significant costs in ensuring that its systems and services comply with GDPR.\nOur services require that we electronically receive, process, store and transmit customer information, which includes certain sensitive consumer and end-user data. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nOur failure to generate the capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new services could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future from debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. The terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. In addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness or obtain financing. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and credit facilities. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to reduce our operations or abandon expansion opportunities. Moreover, even if we are able to continue our operations, our failure to obtain additional financing could reduce our competitiveness as our competitors may provide better-maintained networks or offer an expanded range of services.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to:\n\u2022\nadequately fund our operations;\n\u2022\nenhance and expand the range of services we offer;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand our network;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures and potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions and international expansion;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain key employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to unanticipated capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulations affecting our customers and us and future regulations to which they or we may become subject may harm our business.\nAlthough our services have not been heavily regulated in the past, we are authorized by the FCC to offer certain of our services on an interstate and international basis. We operate our number portability operations in Singapore and India pursuant to licenses granted by these governments, and we are registered as a money service business in the United Kingdom in connection with our financial clearing business. Each of these authorizations subjects us to certain regulatory obligations.\nIn addition, the majority of our customers are MNOs and are subject to significant government regulation by various regulatory bodies, such as the FCC and European Commission. The abolition of retail roaming charges beginning June 15, 2017 in the E.U. as a result of actions taken by the European Commission capped the price that carriers could charge one another for roaming minutes, which lowered the roaming revenues of our customers and could put downward pricing pressure on our data clearing services. Any change in current or future laws or regulations that negatively impact our customers could harm our business and results of operations. Several services that we offer also may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon the customers and end-users of those services. These regulations may increase our costs of operations and affect whether and in what form we are able to provide a given service at all.\nWe cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation, or deregulation, might occur or the effects, adverse or otherwise, that such regulation may have on our business.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nWe depend on the performance of our executive management team and other key employees that have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business and operations. Following changes at our executive management level recently, including our Chief Executive Officer, our future success depends on our newly hired executives to deliver on performance goals. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate other key employees and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel, both in the U.S. and abroad. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense and the costs associated with attracting and retaining key technical personnel are significant. The loss of the services of any of our executive management team or other key employees or failure to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights adequately may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our ability to compete.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and in foreign countries through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and agreements preventing the unauthorized disclosure and use of our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent competitors from copying or reverse engineering our services, or independently developing and marketing services that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. Moreover, third parties may be able to successfully challenge, oppose, invalidate, render unenforceable or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent or, if patents are issued to us, that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. We may fail or be unable to obtain or maintain adequate protections for certain of our intellectual property in the U.S. or certain foreign countries. Further, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the U.S. because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights. Such failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMonitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights can be challenging and costly. From time to time, we may be required to initiate litigation or other action to enforce our intellectual property rights or to establish their validity and enforceability. Such action could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources and management attention, and we cannot assure you that any such action will be successful.\nIf third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and ability to compete.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed or misappropriated the intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, significant litigation regarding patent rights exists in our industry. Our competitors in both the U.S. and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources than we have and have made substantial investments in competing software and technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents or registered copyrights that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our services. We have not conducted an independent review of patents or registered copyrights owned by third parties. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent issuances, the complexities of the technology involved and uncertainty of litigation increase the risk of business assets and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent or other intellectual property litigation.\nIt is possible that third parties will make claims of infringement against us, or against our licensees or customers, in connection with their use of our technology. Any claims, even those without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our relationships with our current or future customers;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease making, licensing, using or selling equipment or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our equipment or services, if feasible;\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention and resources; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us or one of our licensees or customers in connection with the use of our services could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain services, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and harm our future prospects.\nIf third parties claim that our services infringe on their intellectual property rights, we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages or costs they incur in connection with such claims.\nWe generally indemnify our customers with respect to claims that our services infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or\ndefend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the services they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our services. A successful claim or inability to obtain necessary licenses could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and harm our future prospects.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant part of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 19% of the revenues we received from such sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Additionally, portions of our operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies. We cannot assure you that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material impact in the future. In addition, our balance sheet reflects non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, including inter-company balances eliminated in consolidation, which can be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Currently, we do not engage in currency hedging contracts.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if we have to impair our intangible assets or goodwill.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets, including goodwill. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, including capitalized software, net of amortization, together accounted for approximately 85.0% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We may not realize the full fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill. We may engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. Under current accounting standards, we are able to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset, while goodwill is not amortized. We currently evaluate, and will continue to evaluate, on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired. Under current accounting standards, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write-off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets, resulting in a charge to our earnings. Such a write-off could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are a party to a number of lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business and may become a party to others in the future.\nWe are a party to a number of lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business and may become a party to others in the future. The possibility of such litigation, and its timing, is in large part outside our control. While none of the current lawsuits in which we are involved are reasonably estimated to be material as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, it is possible that future litigation could arise, or developments could occur in existing litigation, that could have material adverse effects on us. Refer to Item 1. Business -\u201cLitigation.\u201d\nWe may be unsuccessful in achieving our organic growth strategies, which could limit our revenue growth.\nOur ability to generate organic growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022\nexpand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving needs;\n\u2022\nattract new customers;\n\u2022\nincrease the number of services provided to existing customers; and\n\u2022\nachieve expected revenue from new customer contracts.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate organic growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will occur or be successful.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and may be required to restate previously published financial information.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, have required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for SEC reporting companies. These laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, have and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, we run the risk of non-compliance, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Sarbanes-Oxley requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Moreover, we cannot be certain that these measures would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Even if we were to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements.\nWe are controlled by Carlyle, whose interests in our business may be different than yours.\nAs of February 28, 2018, investment funds affiliated with Carlyle owned 98.6% of the common stock of our indirect parent, Syniverse Corporation, and are able to control our affairs. Carlyle also controls the election of directors, the appointment of management, the entry into mergers, sales of substantially all our assets and other extraordinary transactions. The directors so elected have authority, subject to the terms of our debt, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. If we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of Carlyle and certain of its affiliates as equity holders might conflict with the interests of holders of our indebtedness. In addition, Carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers. Carlyle may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of our indebtedness (excluding capital lease obligations), net of original issue discount and deferred financing costs, was $1,943.2 million (with approximately $85.6 million of unused commitments under our revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d)) on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $1,536.7 million was secured. The aggregate principal amount of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2017 was $1,963.6 million, of which $1,552.4 million was secured. On March 9, 2018, we completed the refinancing (the \u201c2018 Refinancing\u201d) of our existing first lien credit facility (the \u201cOld First Lien Credit Facility\u201d) with the fifth amendment to the Old First Lien Credit Facility to, among other things, establish a new tranche of term loans maturing on March 9, 2023, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,702 million (the \u201cNew First Lien Credit Facility\u201d) and to extend the revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Extended Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) until December 9, 2022. On the same date, we entered into a $220 million second lien term loan facility maturing on March 11, 2024 (the \u201cNew Second Lien Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the New First Lien Credit Facility, the \u201cNew Credit Facilities\u201d). We used the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities to prepay in full (i) all term loans outstanding under the Old First Lien Credit Facility and (ii) the SFHC Notes.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our investors. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, interest and other payments on our indebtedness totaled $117.7 million, which accounted for approximately 44.7% of net cash provided by operating activities excluding interest payments. Following the 2018 Refinancing, we expect to make interest payments of $149.7 million in 2018 and $141.9 million in 2019, which is approximately 56.8% and 53.8%, respectively, of our fiscal 2017 net cash provided by operating activities excluding interest payments. We currently expect to make principal payments for a total of approximately $12.8 million in 2018, as required pursuant to the quarterly principal amortization under the New Credit Facilities. In addition, we expect to pay $41.7 million of our Syniverse Notes at its maturity in January 2019 or earlier if we so elect;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under the New Credit Facilities and the New Extended Revolving Credit Facility are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nexpose us to additional risks related to currency exchange rates and repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt, including during times of adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and credit facilities.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred, and distributions paid, in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, including obligations under lease arrangements that are currently recorded as operating leases even if operating leases were to be treated as debt under U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition, if new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt levels, the related risks that we now face as a result of our leverage would intensify.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could impact our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe indenture governing the Syniverse Notes and the credit agreements governing the New Credit Facilities and New Extended Revolving Credit Facility limit our ability, and the terms of any future indebtedness may limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue disqualified and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nagree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nincur liens; and\n\u2022\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness. Following an event of default, the lenders under the New Extended Revolving Credit Facility will also have the right to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the New Credit Facilities will also have the right to proceed against the collateral that secures those borrowings. If the indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities, and the Syniverse Notes were to be accelerated, it could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the New Credit Facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our indebtedness will restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants and limitations in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the New Credit Facilities and New Extended Revolving Credit Facility, could proceed against the collateral securing such secured obligations. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nThe right of holders of Syniverse Notes to receive payments on the Syniverse Notes is effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. Further, the guarantees of the Syniverse Notes are effectively subordinated to all our guarantors\u2019 existing and future secured indebtedness.\nThe Syniverse Notes are not secured by any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets. Holders of our secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of the guarantors could have claims that are prior to the claims of holders of the Syniverse Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing that other indebtedness. Notably, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including the guarantors, are parties to the New Credit Facilities and New Extended Credit Facility, which are secured by liens on a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of the guarantors. The Syniverse Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of secured indebtedness will have a prior claim to those of our assets that constitute their collateral. Holders of the Syniverse Notes will participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the Syniverse Notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in our remaining assets. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Syniverse Notes. As a result, holders of the Syniverse Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of our secured indebtedness.\nFollowing the 2018 Refinancing, as of March 9, 2018, the aggregate amount of Syniverse\u2019s secured indebtedness (excluding capital lease obligations) was approximately $1,922.0 million, and we had $85.6 million of unused commitments under our New Extended Revolving Credit Facility. We are permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future under the terms of the indenture governing the Syniverse Notes.\nClaims of noteholders are effectively subordinated to claims of creditors of all of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Syniverse Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by our existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the New Credit Facilities. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries held approximately $625.0 million, or 19.9%, of our total assets and $458.4 million, or 21.0%, of our total liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and accounted for approximately $187.5 million, or 23.6%, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 (all amounts presented exclude intercompany balances). In addition, we have the ability to designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the indenture and the New Credit Facilities, and any subsidiary so designated will not be a guarantor of the Syniverse Notes or the New Credit Facilities.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Syniverse Notes, or to make any funds available therefore, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of noteholders to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries\u2019 assets, are effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt of those subsidiaries. In addition, the indenture governing the Syniverse Notes and the credit agreements governing the New Credit Facilities permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur significant additional indebtedness.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and may not have access to sufficient cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including to make payments on our indebtedness.\nWe are a holding company and have limited direct operations. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or inter-company loans and such dividends may be restricted by law or the agreements of our subsidiaries.\nThe lenders under the New Credit Facilities have the discretion to release the guarantors under the New Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the Syniverse Notes.\nWhile any obligations under the New Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the Syniverse Notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Syniverse Notes or the trustee under the indenture governing the Syniverse Notes, at the discretion of lenders under the New Credit Facilities, if such guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the New Credit Facilities or any other indebtedness. The lenders under the New Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the New Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. Holders of the Syniverse Notes will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the Syniverse Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.", "PERMNO": 90565, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "SVR.1"}
