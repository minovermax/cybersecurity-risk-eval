{"cik": "56978", "company": "KULICKE & SOFFA INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nOur operating results and financial condition are adversely impacted by volatile worldwide economic conditions.\nThough the semiconductor industry's cycle can be independent of the general economy, global economic conditions may have a direct impact on demand for semiconductor units and ultimately demand for semiconductor capital equipment and expendable tools. Accordingly, our business and financial performance is impacted, both positively and negatively, by fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited and forecasting is difficult. There can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products and we believe historic industry-wide volatility will persist.\nUnpredictable spending by our customers due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment could adversely affect our net revenue and profitability.\nWe depend upon demand from our customers including IDMs and OSATs, industrial manufacturers and automotive electronics suppliers. Our net revenue and profitability is based upon our customers' level of anticipated sales. Reductions or other fluctuations in their spending as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment, such as government, economic or fiscal instability, restricted global credit conditions, reduced demand, unbalanced inventory levels, fluctuations in interest rates, higher energy prices, or other conditions, could adversely affect our net revenue and profitability. The impact of general economic slowdowns could make our customers cautious and delay orders until the economic environment becomes clearer.\nThe semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. Cyclical industry downturns are made worse by volatile global economic conditions.\nOur operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, both IDMs and OSATs. Expenditures by our customers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors, including mobile devices, personal computers, consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, automotive goods and other industrial products. Significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe semiconductor industry is volatile, with periods of rapid growth followed by industry-wide retrenchment. These periodic downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our business, financial condition and operating results. Downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity, and accelerated erosion of selling prices. Historically these downturns have severely and negatively affected the industry's demand for capital equipment, including assembly equipment and, to a lesser extent, expendable tools. There can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products. In any case, we believe the historical volatility of our business, both upward and downward, will persist.\nWe may experience increasing price pressure.\nTypically our average selling prices have declined over time. We seek to offset this decline by continually reducing our cost structure by consolidating operations in lower cost areas, reducing other operating costs, and by pursuing product strategies focused on product performance and customer service. These efforts may not be able to fully offset price declines; therefore, our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nIn the past, our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly. We expect quarterly results will continue to fluctuate. Although these fluctuations are partly due to the cyclical and volatile nature of the semiconductor industry, they also reflect other factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nSome of the factors that may cause our net revenue and operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are:\n\u2022\nmarket downturns;\n\u2022\nindustry inventory level;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products we sell because, for example:\n\u25e6\ncertain lines of equipment within our business segments are more profitable than others; and\n\u25e6\nsome sales arrangements have higher gross margins than others;\n\u2022\ncancelled or deferred orders;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures may force us to reduce prices;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of the components for our products;\n\u2022\ndelays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and market acceptance of these products when introduced;\n\u2022\ncustomers' delay in purchasing our products due to anticipation that we or our competitors may introduce new or upgraded products; and\n\u2022\nour competitors' introduction of new products.\nMany of our expenses, such as research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expense, do not vary directly with our net revenue. Our research and development efforts include long-term projects lasting a year or more, which require significant investments. In order to realize the benefits of these projects, we believe that we must continue to fund them even during periods when our revenue has declined. As a result, a decline in our net revenue would adversely affect our operating results as we continue to make these expenditures. In addition, if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net revenue, our operating results would decline. In a downturn, we may have excess inventory, which could be written off. Some of the other factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period-to-period include:\n\u2022\ntiming and extent of our research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nseverance, restructuring, and other costs of relocating facilities;\n\u2022\ninventory write-offs due to obsolescence; and\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of labor or materials.\nBecause our net revenue and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict, we believe consecutive period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nWe may not be able to rapidly develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business.\nWe believe our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner in response to customers' demands for higher performance assembly equipment and leading-edge materials customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits, and capital equipment designs. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer improved performance and features, or lower prices which may render our products less competitive. The development and commercialization of new products require significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products we seek to develop may never become profitable. In addition, we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers' future needs or achieve market acceptance.\nThe transition from gold to copper wire bonding by our customers and the industry may be substantially completed.\nSince fiscal 2010, many of our customers have converted their bonding wire from gold to copper wire. Since this initial conversion, a majority of our wire bonder sales are copper capable bonders. In fiscal 2015, 70% of total ball bonders sold by the Company were copper capable bonders. If the transition from gold to copper wire bonding by our customers is substantially completed or customers transition away from copper wire bonding, there may be a reduced demand for our wire bonders and our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantially all of our sales and manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S., and we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines, all of which subject us to risks, including risks from changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and conflicts.\nApproximately 91.2%, 94.4%, and 97.3% of our net revenue for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, was for shipments to customers located outside of the U.S., primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. We expect our future performance to depend on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region. Some of these economies have been highly volatile, resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies, and political and economic instability. These conditions may continue or worsen, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe also rely on non-U.S. suppliers for materials and components used in our products, and substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the U.S. We manufacture our ball, wedge and APAMA bonders in Singapore, our APMR and SMT solutions in the Netherlands, our dicing blades, capillaries and bonding wedges in China and capillary blanks in\nIsrael. In addition, our corporate headquarters is in Singapore and we have sales, service and support personnel in China, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S., Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands. We also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines. As a result, a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international, and particularly Asia/Pacific, commerce, such as:\n\u2022\nrisks of war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt manufacturing and markets;\n\u2022\nseizure of our foreign assets, including cash;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange restrictions and capital controls;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of our assets, including cash;\n\u2022\nsignificant foreign and U.S. taxes on repatriated cash;\n\u2022\ndifficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations;\n\u2022\npossible disagreements with tax authorities;\n\u2022\nepisodic events outside our control such as, for example, outbreaks of influenza or other illnesses;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, fires or floods;\n\u2022\ntariff and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions;\n\u2022\nlabor work stoppages and strikes in our factories or the factories of our suppliers;\n\u2022\nforeign governments' monetary policies and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nless protective foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\nnew laws and regulations, such as Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP); and\n\u2022\nlegal systems which are less developed and may be less predictable than those in the U.S.\nIn addition, there is a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationship between Taiwan and China. Conflict or instability could disrupt the operations of our customers and/or suppliers in both Taiwan and China. Additionally, our manufacturing operations in China could be disrupted by any conflict.\nOur international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets.\nIncreased labor costs and competition for qualified personnel may reduce the efficiency of our flexible manufacturing model and adversely impact our operating results.\nThere is some uncertainty with respect to the pace of rising labor costs in the various countries in which we operate. In addition, there is substantial competition in China, Singapore, Israel and the Netherlands for qualified and capable personnel, which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to staff sufficient personnel at our China, Singapore, Israel and the Netherlands facilities or if there are increases in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers, we may experience increased manufacturing costs, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nBecause most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars or Euro, an increase in value of the U.S. dollar or Euro against foreign currencies will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors. In addition, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies other than Euro could make our costs in non-U.S. locations more expensive to fund. Our ability to compete overseas may therefore be materially and adversely affected by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar or the Euro against other currencies.\nBecause nearly all of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to net working capital exposures denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiaries' functional currency, and remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries' net monetary assets from the subsidiaries' local currency into the subsidiaries' functional currency. In general, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record translation and remeasurement gains. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record losses on translation and remeasurement. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase\nthe cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in U.S. dollars, and a weakened U.S. dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials, both of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows. Our primary exposures include the Singapore Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Swiss Franc, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar, South Korean Won, Israeli Shekel and Euro. Although we from time to time have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposure of our operating expenses, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to continue to consolidate manufacturing and other facilities without incurring unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to drive further efficiency, we may consolidate our manufacturing facilities. Should we consolidate, we may experience unanticipated events, including the actions of governments, suppliers, employees or customers, which may result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining management, marketing and technical employees as well as on the succession of senior management.\nOur future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing, finance, accounting and technical employees, including senior management. Experienced personnel with the relevant and necessary skill sets in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Asia, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial, marketing, finance, accounting and technical personnel we require, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. From time to time, senior management may leave our company, such as the recent departure of our chief executive officer on October 5, 2015. While we strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes, the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement critical personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.\nDifficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses.\nWe typically operate our business with limited visibility of future demand. As a result, we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses. We generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts for demand. We have in the past failed, and may again in the future fail, to accurately forecast demand for our products. This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments or, alternatively, an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nAlternative packaging technologies may render some of our products obsolete and materially and adversely affect our overall business and financial results.\nAlternative packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package, as compared to traditional wire bonding. These technologies include flip chip and wafer level packaging. Some of these alternative technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package. The semiconductor industry may, in the future, shift a significant part of its volume into alternative packaging technologies, such as those discussed above, which do not employ our products. If a significant shift to alternative packaging technologies to a technology not offered by us were to occur, demand for our equipment and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected. Given the lack of a significant alternate revenue stream other than wire bonding, a reduced demand for our equipment could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause a small number of customers account for most of our sales, our net revenue could decline if we lose a significant customer.\nThe semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment and packaging materials. Sales to a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our net revenue. Sales to our largest customers, defined as\nmore than 10% of our net revenue, comprised 11.0% of our net revenue for fiscal 2013, and in the future could again represent a significant percentage of our sales. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in either fiscal 2014 or 2015.\nWe expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. Thus, our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our customers. Any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships. If, for example, during periods of escalating demand for our equipment, we were unable to add inventory and production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers, they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business. Similarly, if we are unable for any other reason to meet production or delivery schedules, particularly during a period of escalating demand, our relationships with our key customers could be adversely affected. If we lose orders from a significant customer, or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially, these losses or reductions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation, reduction or delay in delivery schedules, which may result in lower than expected revenues.\nWe manufacture products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. The semiconductor industry is occasionally subject to double-booking and rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand and macro-economic conditions. Accordingly, many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty. As a result, we must commit resources to the manufacture of products without binding purchase commitments from customers. Even in cases where our standard terms and conditions of sale or other contractual arrangements do not permit a customer to cancel an order without penalty, we may from time to time accept cancellations to maintain customer relationships or because of industry practice, custom or other factors. Our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on both our levels of inventory and revenues. While we currently believe our inventory levels are appropriate for the current economic environment, continued global economic uncertainty may result in lower than expected demand.\nUndetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results.\nIf flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate tests and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCosts related to product defect and errata may harm our results of operations and business.\nCosts of product defects and errata (deviations from product specifications) due to, for example, problems in our design and manufacturing processes, or those of our suppliers, could include:\n\u2022\nwriting off the value of inventory;\n\u2022\ndisposing of products that cannot be fixed;\n\u2022\nretrofitting products that have been shipped;\n\u2022\nproviding product replacements or modifications; and\n\u2022\ndefending against litigation.\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower our operating profits. Our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata, and product demand could be reduced. These factors could harm our business and financial results.\nWe depend on our suppliers, including sole source suppliers, for critical raw materials, components and subassemblies. If our suppliers do not deliver their products to us, we would be unable to deliver our products to our customers.\nOur products are complex and require raw materials, components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability, accuracy and performance. We rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for many components and raw materials. As a result, we are exposed to a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\ndecreased control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our manufacturing processes in response to changes in the market, which may delay our shipments;\n\u2022\nour inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials;\n\u2022\nthe relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers, which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies, components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices;\n\u2022\nthe inability of suppliers to meet customer demand requirements during volatile cycles;\n\u2022\nreliability or quality issues with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short term alternative;\n\u2022\nshortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including work stoppage or fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndelays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies, which, in turn, may delay shipments to our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of suppliers as a result of consolidation of suppliers in the industry; and\n\u2022\nloss of suppliers because of their bankruptcy or insolvency.\nIf we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time and at expected cost for these or any other reasons, or we are unable to meet customer expectations as to cycle time, or we are unable to maintain acceptable product quality or reliability, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nIn 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, regardless of whether these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to conduct due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. In addition, since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nWe may acquire or divest businesses or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances, which may materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may decide to buy or sell businesses or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances. We may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing businesses and successfully implement, improve and expand our systems, procedures and controls to accommodate these acquisitions. These transactions place additional constraints on our management and current labor force. Additionally, these transactions require significant resources from our legal, finance and business teams. In addition, we may divest existing businesses, which would cause a decline in revenue and may make our financial results more volatile. If we fail to integrate and manage acquired businesses successfully or to manage the risks associated with divestitures, joint ventures or other alliances, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common shares and our earnings per share may decline as a result of any acquisitions or divestitures.\nThe market price of our common shares may decline as a result of any acquisitions or divestitures made by us if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, the failure to achieve expected benefits and unanticipated costs relating to our acquisitions could reduce our future earnings per share.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries.\nThe semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries are very competitive. In the semiconductor equipment industry, significant competitive factors include performance, quality, customer support and price. In the semiconductor packaging materials industry, competitive factors include price, delivery and quality.\nIn each of our markets, we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants. In addition, established competitors may combine to form larger, better capitalized companies. Some of our competitors have or may have significantly greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources. Some of these competitors are Asian\nand European companies that have had, and may continue to have, an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers, without regard to other considerations.\nWe expect our competitors to improve their current products' performance, and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics. Our competitors may independently develop technology similar to or better than ours. New product and material introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales. If a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor's product or materials for a particular assembly operation, we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time. Manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relationships with suppliers and assembly equipment providers in our industry and often go years without requiring replacement. In addition, we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we cannot compete successfully, we could be forced to reduce prices and could lose customers and experience reduced margins and profitability.\nOur success depends in part on our intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely principally on contractual restrictions (such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions) in our agreements with employees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary \u201cknow-how.\u201d We also rely, in some cases, on patent and copyright protection, although this protection may in some cases be insufficient as the duration of our patents often exceeds the commercial life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents due to the rapid development of technology in our industry. We may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nemployees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements, and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive, or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nforeign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nour patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology; our patents or copyrights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented; or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology.\nIn addition, our partners and alliances may have rights to technology developed by us. We may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be weakened.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property, which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses, or prevent us from selling some of our products.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, with frequent introductions of new products and technologies. Industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others, creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims they infringe on the intellectual property of others. We may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement. If we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture, market or use the affected product, or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing or re-engineering our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly, impractical or time consuming.\nOccasionally, third parties assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. In these cases, we defend, and will continue to defend, against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous material, investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees. Increasingly, public attention has focused on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations.\nProper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants. In many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater. These facilities operate under permits that must be renewed periodically. A violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits, fines, penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits, including potential shutdown of operations.\nCompliance with existing or future, land use, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may: (1) result in significant costs to us for additional capital equipment or other process requirements, (2) restrict our ability to expand our operations and/or (3) cause us to curtail our operations. We also could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines or other sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. Any costs or liabilities to comply with or imposed under these laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common shares.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities will result in dilution of our existing shareholders' equity interests in us. Our board of directors has the authority to issue, without vote or action of shareholders, preferred shares in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred shares could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. In addition, we are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to an aggregate of 200 million common shares, of which approximately 71.2 million shares were outstanding as of October 3, 2015. We are also authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, securities convertible into either common shares or preferred shares.\nWeaknesses in our internal controls and procedures could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nOur internal controls may not prevent all potential errors or fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. We or our independent registered public accountants may identify material weaknesses in our internal controls which could adversely affect our ability to ensure proper financial reporting and could affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common shares.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. We also hold large amounts of data in data center facilities around the world, primarily in Singapore and the U.S., which our business depends upon. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. Our security procedures, such as virus protection software and our business continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events, which could adversely impact our operations. In addition, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become out-of-date or obsolete and are not able to deliver the type of data integrity and reporting we need to run our business. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and or upgrade existing systems, we could be faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nIf the tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in Singapore change or cease to be in effect or applicable, in part or in whole, for any reason, the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase.\nWe have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax holidays extended to us in Singapore to encourage investment or employment. We have the Development and Expansion Incentive (\u201cDEI\u201d) from Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, which provides that certain classes of income we earn in Singapore are subject to reduced\nrates of Singapore income tax. In order to retain the tax benefit, we must meet certain operating conditions, among other things, maintenance of certain global headquarters functions, specified IP activities and specified manufacturing activities in Singapore. The DEI is presently scheduled to expire in 2020. Renewals and extensions of the DEI are at the discretion of the Singapore government, and we may not be able to extend the tax incentive arrangement after its expiration on similar terms or at all. We may also elect not to renew or extend this tax incentive arrangement. In the absence of DEI, the corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply would be 17%. The tax incentive is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in the tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits. In such event, we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive.\nRisks Related to the Assembl\u00e9on Acquisition\nWe face risks associated with integrating Assembl\u00e9on into the Company.\nThe successful expansion of our business and operations resulting from the Assembl\u00e9on acquisition will require significant time, effort, attention and dedication of management and may strain our operational and financial resources. It is possible that integrating Assembl\u00e9on and its businesses into the Company could result in changes to or pressure on compliance with standards, controls, procedures and policies. This process could expose us to risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in coordinating information, communication and other systems;\n\u2022\nunexpected loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management attention from our other businesses;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key customers;\n\u2022\nthe need to modify operating and accounting controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuation that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nIn addition, it is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from Assembl\u00e9on\u2019s business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.\nThese types of challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Assembl\u00e9on acquisition.\nThe Assembl\u00e9on acquisition is intended to expand our presence in the automotive, industrial and advanced packaging markets. The success of the Assembl\u00e9on acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate Assembl\u00e9on and its businesses into the Company in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not disrupt existing client relationships or result in decreased revenues due to customer attrition or other factors. Assembl\u00e9on\u2019s businesses are also subject to certain risks that may negatively affect the financial results for our Equipment and Expendable Tools business segments, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nAssembl\u00e9on\u2019s businesses are largely dependent on the health of the industries in which it participates. These industries may be impacted by market and regulatory factors, and there can be no assurance that we will realize the potential growth opportunities from these industries.\n\u2022\nThe goodwill established in connection with our acquisition of Assembl\u00e9on represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from the assets we have acquired that did not qualify to be identified and recognized individually. The goodwill also includes the value of expected future cash flows of Assembl\u00e9on, expected synergies with our other affiliates and other unidentifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is subject to review for impairment annually, or more frequently, whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The value of goodwill is supported by revenue, which is driven primarily by transaction volume. Intangible assets other than goodwill primarily consist of developed technology, customer relationships and trade and brand name.\n\u2022\nThe calculation of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective in nature, such as attrition rates, discount rates, future expected cash flows and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If actual results differ from our assumptions, we may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill.\nFor these and other reasons there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies and benefits from the transaction will be realized fully or at all. If we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition, we may be required to write down or write off all such intangible assets or goodwill. Such an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther Risks\nOur ability to recognize tax benefits on future domestic U.S. tax losses and our existing U.S. net operating loss position may be limited.\nWe have generated net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax attributes for U.S. tax purposes (\u201cTax Benefits\u201d) that can be used to reduce our future federal income tax obligations. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the potential future utilization of our Tax Benefits for U.S. tax purposes may be limited following an ownership change. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% point increase in equity ownership by 5% shareholders in any three-year period under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. An ownership change may significantly limit our ability to fully utilize our net operating losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. As of October 3, 2015, we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $102.5 million, domestic state net operating loss carryforwards of $186.0 million, domestic federal net operating loss carryforwards of $3.2 million, and tax credit carryforwards of $7.4 million that will reduce future taxable income.\nPotential changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws could increase our income tax expense.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed tax revisions will be enacted, or, if enacted, what the scope of the revisions will be. Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, if enacted, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and under Pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as Pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a fundamental change. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that:\n\u2022\nclassify our board of directors into four classes, with one class being elected each year;\n\u2022\npermit our board to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nprohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of 20% or more of our voting securities without super-majority board or shareholder approval.\nFurther, under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, because our shareholders approved bylaw provisions that provide for a classified board of directors, shareholders may remove directors only for cause. These provisions and some other provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law could delay, defer or prevent us from experiencing a fundamental change and may adversely affect our common shareholders' voting and other rights.\nTerrorist attacks, or other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the U.S. or U.S. businesses. Terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Our primary facilities include administrative, sales and research and development facilities in Singapore and the U.S. and manufacturing and research and development facilities in China, and Israel. Additional terrorist attacks may disrupt the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for all of our facilities. Furthermore, additional attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products in the U.S. and overseas. Additional attacks or any broader conflict, could negatively impact our domestic and international sales, our supply chain, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Political and economic instability in some regions of the world could negatively impact our business. The consequences of terrorist attacks or armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 48144, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "KLIC"}
