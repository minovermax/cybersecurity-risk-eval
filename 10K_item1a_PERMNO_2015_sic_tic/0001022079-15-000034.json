Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities. The risks below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently deem immaterial, may also negatively impact us. Our business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors.\nThis Report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. Our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face described below and elsewhere. See \u201cCautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results\u201d on page 30.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is evolving, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is evolving, in part in response to March 2010 U.S. federal legislation enacted to reform healthcare. The law provides for reductions in the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule of 1.75% for five years beginning in 2011 and also includes a productivity adjustment that reduces the CPI market basket update beginning in 2011. The law imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used by laboratories. The law established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is responsible annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. These proposals automatically will be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the law calls for a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The law provides for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The law also permits the establishment of ACOs.\nSignificant change is taking place in the healthcare system, including as discussed above under the heading The United States Clinical Testing Industry, beginning on page 12. For example, ACOs and patient-centered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care. Value-based reimbursement is increasing. Health care services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine). We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.\nThe clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices. Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians and encourage the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, and as a result, an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community physicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. Increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position. The formation of ACOs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.\nThe diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nGovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.\nFrom time to time, Congress has legislated reductions in, or frozen updates to, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. In addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services which are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis. In recent years, reductions in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for anatomic pathology services adversely impacted our business relative to the business of some of our competitors whose anatomic pathology business was not as sizable as ours. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. The 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels.\nIn addition, over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called \u201cMedicare Advantage\u201d programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs. There has been continued growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Also in recent years, states have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements. Recently, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, service coverage restrictions and imposing taxes on our services.\nFrom time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding can be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care. Congress periodically considers cost-saving initiatives as part of its deficit reduction discussions. These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical laboratory services, co-payments for clinical laboratory testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions.\n2014 U.S. federal legislation, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, is impacting the clinical laboratory testing industry. Key parts of this legislation include provisions that provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a market-based process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule, developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule. If this process does not recognize the value that clinical laboratory testing brings to the healthcare system, our business can be materially adversely impacted.\nThird parties, including health plans, have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. For example, in light of health care reform, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services. ACOs and IDNs also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. In addition, some health plans have been willing to limit the PPO or POS laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing; we may cease to be a contracted provider to a health plan. Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and considering steps such as requiring preauthorization of testing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. The 2010 federal healthcare reform legislation includes provisions, including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, that may encourage health insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to improve our efficiency.\nIt is important that we continue to improve our efficiency to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including diagnostic information services.\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky, and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult.\nWe plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing, investments and alliances. However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, and to integrate it into our business. The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners. Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.\nEach acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results. The process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:\n\u2022\nloss of key customers or employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in standardizing information and other systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and\n\u2022\nthe added costs of dealing with such disruptions.\nIf we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, including many of those relating to:\n\u2022\nbilling and reimbursement of clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncertification or licensure of clinical laboratories;\n\u2022\nthe anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe laws and regulations administered by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe corporate practice of medicine;\n\u2022\noperational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n\u2022\nphysician fee splitting;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and hospitals;\n\u2022\nsafety and health of laboratory employees; and\n\u2022\nhandling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.\nThese laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices. We may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly receive requests for information, and occasionally subpoenas, from governmental authorities. We also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other \u201cwhistleblowers.\u201d The federal and state governments continue to strengthen their scrutiny and enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse. In addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;\n\u2022\nenforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our services ; and/or\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. Moreover, even when an investigation is resolved favorably, the process may be time-consuming and the legal costs and diversion of management focus may be extensive.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification, withdrawal or reconsideration. Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the FDA's approach to regulation.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. A number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has announced guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing regulation of LDTs. These initiatives could have a significant impact on our business, including the application of medical device excise taxes to our business. The approach may hinder our ability to develop and market new services, cause an increase in the cost of our services, delay our ability to introduce new tests or hinder our ability to perform testing.\nFailure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals and employer groups. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.\nAttacks on our information technology systems, or failure in these systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nIT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. Unauthorized persons may seek to obtain intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our IT systems. Moreover, despite the security measures we have implemented, our IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses, unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems. Our information technology systems from time to time have experienced minor attacks, minor viruses, attempted intrusions or similar problems, like other major companies, but each was mitigated, and none materially disrupted, interrupted, damaged or shutdown the Company's information technology systems, materially disrupted the Company's performance of its business or, to the Company's knowledge, resulted in material unauthorized access to data.\nWe have taken precautionary measures to prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property and other confidential information that we house on our systems. In addition, we continue to strengthen precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, and to detect, future cyber threats. However, cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, compromise intellectual property or confidential information or otherwise adversely impact our business. There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures will prevent or successfully defend against cyber threats that could have a significant impact on our business.\nWe are planning to implement common laboratory information and billing systems, which will promote standardized processes. We expect that this effort will take several years to complete and may result in temporary disruptions in service.\nFailure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new tests, technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe clinical testing industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services. Our success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms. We may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services. We also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our esoteric testing business, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\n\u2022\nredesign or reengineer our tests;\n\u2022\nchange our business processes; or\n\u2022\npay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nThe development of new, more cost-effective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be \u201cwaived\u201d tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits.\nSome traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site. Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some esoteric testing. Internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers, such as the Company.\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.8 billion of debt outstanding. Except for operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available. Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt. We have obtained ratings on our debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant. If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase. Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur people are a critical resource. The supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong. We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical or professional employees (e.g., pathologists) at our clinical laboratories or research centers.\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nThe provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks. The services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\nNegligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events. We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospital-based pathologists. We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we generate or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do not adequately safeguard that information and it were to become available to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.\nWe are subject to numerous political, legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.\nAlthough we conduct most of our business in the United States, our international operations increase our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include without limitation:\n\u2022\nchanges in the local economic environment;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nsocial changes;\n\u2022\nintellectual property legal protections and remedies;\n\u2022\ntrade regulations;\n\u2022\nprocedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of services;\n\u2022\nexchange controls;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining qualified employees;\n\u2022\nlocal market practices;\n\u2022\nexport and import controls;\n\u2022\nweak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in local laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\npotentially longer payment and collection cycles.\nInternational operations also require us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions and to overcome challenges based on differing languages and cultures.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by CMS' adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses.\nCMS has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10, which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses. The new coding set is currently required to be implemented by October 1, 2015. We must adequately implement the new coding set. In addition, physicians may fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests; historically, delays in billing have resulted in increased costs and decreased collection of payment.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for tests.\nThe American Medical Association CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel is continuing its process of establishing billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing and toxicology testing. The adoption of these codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed. This has led, and could continue to lead, to limited coverage decisions, payment denials or new procedures or conditions for payment. Health plans, Medicare contractors and Medicaid programs continue to consider or implement the new codes and issue coverage and payment decisions. Payment levels for many new codes remain largely unresolved and health care providers continue to address implementation of the new codes.\nAdverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, disputes as to intellectual property, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers. Some of the proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management's attention from operations. The proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effect of trends in the U.S. healthcare system, including healthcare utilization and increased patient financial responsibility for services.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of trends in the utilization of the healthcare system in the United States. Trends in the utilization of the U.S. healthcare system can be influenced by such factors as unemployment, under-employed workers, decisions to delay medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care. Declining utilization of the U.S. healthcare system may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services.\nIn the current environment, patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased financial responsibility for, their healthcare. Our operations also may be adversely impacted by the recent trend to increased patient responsibility for payment for healthcare services, including diagnostic information services.\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nSome statements and disclosures in this document are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan\u201d or \u201ccontinue.\u201d These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our plans and expectations, including actual results, to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this document. The following important factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from those projected, forecasted or estimated by us in forward-looking statements:\n(a)\nHeightened competition from commercial clinical testing companies, hospitals, physicians and others.\n(b)\nIncreased pricing pressure from customers and payers.\n(c)\nA decline in economic conditions.\n(d)\nImpact of changes in payer mix, including any shift from fee-for-service to discounted or capitated fee arrangements.\n(e)\nAdverse actions by government or other third-party payers, including healthcare reform that focuses on reducing healthcare costs but does not recognize the value and importance to healthcare of diagnostic testing, unilateral reduction of fee schedules payable to us, competitive bidding, and an increase in the practice of negotiating for exclusive arrangements that involve aggressively priced capitated or fee-for-service payments by health insurers or other payers.\n(f)\nThe impact upon our testing volume and collected revenue or general or administrative expenses resulting from our compliance with Medicare and Medicaid administrative policies and requirements of third-party payers.
