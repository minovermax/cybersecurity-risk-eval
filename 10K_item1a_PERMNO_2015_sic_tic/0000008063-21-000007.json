RISK FACTORS\nCovid-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact. As previously disclosed, we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our stock, and the aerospace industry, which has raised the prospect of an extended global recession. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world have instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions or limits on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Our operations have been deemed essential under applicable law, but there is no guarantee this will continue. We follow the COVID-19 guidelines from the CDC concerning the health and safety of our personnel, these measures have resulted in attenuating activity and, in some cases, required temporary closures of certain of our facilities, among other impacts. The duration of these measures is unknown, may be extended and additional measures, including facility closures, may be imposed.\nAmong the potential effects of COVID-19 and other similar outbreaks on the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Reduced consumer and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending, which may adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations. In addition, volatility in the financial markets could increase the cost of capital and/or limit its availability.\n\u2022Economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 is expected to cause continued difficulty for our customers, suppliers and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.\n\u2022Aircraft manufacturers have experienced a disruption in production and demand as customers defer delivery of new aircraft, resulting in slowed or halted production at facilities throughout the world. Commercial airlines have experienced a significant reduction in air traffic. Commercial airlines and other manufacturers have focused on conserving cash to preserve liquidity, which has had a negative impact on airframe and aftermarket sales.\n\u2022The potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers. If circumstances surrounding our customers\u2019 financial capabilities were to deteriorate, asset write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\u2022Disruption of our supply chain. Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, third-party distributors, sub-contractors and customers have been and may be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on their employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing or the operations of our suppliers, third-party distributors, or sub-contractors, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations, and customer relationships.\n\u2022The need to incur additional restructuring charges to optimize our cost structure if a recovery in the aerospace market occurs slower than anticipated.\nRecognizing the unprecedented nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the on-going impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nMarket Risks\nThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2020, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing and Panasonic representing approximately 9.5% and 11.1% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.\nIn October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content, and which represented our largest OEM production program before the pandemic. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, which started in March of 2019, has caused the production rate of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The 737 MAX grounding affected our business both because of the production pause, impacting our line-fit content, and because it left many of our airline customers short of capacity, particularly in 2019 but continuing into 2020, which made them reluctant to take other aircraft out of service to install the types of retrofit products they buy from us. Although the 737 MAX was re-certified in the United States in November 2020 and in Europe in January 2021, if production rates do not materialize as anticipated, our Aerospace segment sales could be significantly impacted in the near or long-term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even as deliveries of the 737 MAX program resumes, demand for the aircraft could be lower than was expected prior to the initial grounding of the aircraft due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand, all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines\u2019 spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.\nWe are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.\nIn our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\nAdditionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:\n\u2022develop products that are superior to our products;\n\u2022develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;\n\u2022develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or\n\u2022adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.\nWe depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.\nContracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention from our core business;\n\u2022the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;\n\u2022the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;\n\u2022the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.\nIn addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if\nnew industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.\nOur new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.\nOperational Risks\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of \u201cphishing\u201d attacks.\nThe threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers\u2019 data, our employees\u2019 data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face.\nOur inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management\u2019s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation above and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.\nSome of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company\u2019s\nsales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract\u2019s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.\nThe failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions. The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our credit facility contains certain financial covenants. An unexpected decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the revolving credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the credit facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash. If the debt under the credit facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.\nAdditionally, our credit facility also contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The credit facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company to\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022sell assets; and\n\u2022engage in certain business activities.\nThe amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $173.0 million of long-term debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2020 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;\n\u2022A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and\n\u2022We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.4% and 17.7% of our total assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with four Aerospace reporting units, totaling $86.3 million. In 2019, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million related to our AeroSat antenna business, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2020, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.\nThe potential phase out of LIBOR may negatively impact our debt agreements and financial position, results of operations and liquidity. On July 27, 2017, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. Extending the publication of certain USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023 would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruptions. However, it is unclear whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long-lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million and $9.5 million in the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nChanges in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nAdditionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, our subsidiary, AES is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRefer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2020, approximately 10% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $63.3 million at December 31, 2020. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2020 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.\nGovernment regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nGeneral Risks\nOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.\nFuture terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government\u2019s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.\nIf we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.\nOur stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our stock price ranged from a low of $6.40 to a high of $28.92. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations and new products;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u2022the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and\n\u2022impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price.", "PERMNO": 15457, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "ATRO"}
