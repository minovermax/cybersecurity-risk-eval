Investors should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision. The realization of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse affect on the Company and the price of its common stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS\nGreater than expected loan losses may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s investment and loan portfolio subject the Company to credit risk. Credit losses are always inherent in the banking business but the continuing challenging economic environment in the Company\u2019s trade area presents even more exposure to loss. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors. The Company believes that its current allowance for loan losses is adequate and appropriate. However, if the Company\u2019s assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. In the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient to cover any remaining loan balances, the Company could experience significant loan losses or increase the provision for loan losses or both, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. In fact, these conditions caused the net losses experienced by the Company in 2013 and 2014. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nThe Company has a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, and a greater downturn in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect earnings.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. At December 31, 2014, approximately 86% of the Company\u2019s loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment if the borrower defaults and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Further deterioration in the value of real estate generally or in the Company\u2019s trade area specifically could significantly impair the value of the collateral and restrict the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Furthermore, it is likely that the Company would be required to increase the provision for loan losses. If the Company were required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate value or to increase the allowance for loan losses, the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company has a high concentration of exposure to a number of industries.\nThe Company has concentrations of loan exposure to the hotel/motel and gaming industries. At December 31, 2014, these exposures were approximately $47,144,000 and $31,353,000 or 13% and 9%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio. Economic conditions have negatively impacted tourism, which is one of the major factors for success in these industries. Given the size of these relationships, a significant loss in either of these portfolios could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe continuing economic downturn or a natural disaster, especially one affecting the Company\u2019s trade area, could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s trade area includes the Mississippi Gulf Coast and portions of southeast Louisiana and southwest Alabama. With the exception of a number of credits that are considered out of area, the Company\u2019s credit exposure is generally limited to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Although the national economy has shown signs of improvement, local conditions appear to be lagging this trend. As a result, the Company is at risk from continuing adverse business developments in its trade area, including declining real estate value, increasing loan delinquencies, personal and business bankruptcies and unemployment rates. The Company is also at risk to weather-related disasters including hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. If the economy in the Company\u2019s trade area experiences a natural disaster or worsening economic conditions, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nCurrent economic factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nIn addition to funds provided by its banking activities such as deposits, loan payments and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities, the Company\u2019s liquidity needs have traditionally been met through the purchase of federal funds, often on an unsecured basis, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d). Disruption in the financial markets in previous years negatively impacted the availability of these unsecured funds. As a result, the Company increased its borrowing lines with the FHLB and secured approval to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Discount Window Primary Credit Program.\nThe Company is subject to industry competition which may have an impact on its success.\nThe profitability of the Company depends on its ability to compete successfully. The Company operates in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than the Company. The Company faces competition in its trade area from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries. Some of these non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company or the Bank and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Increased competition could require the Company to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates offered on loans, which could adversely affect and also limit future growth and earnings prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company is asset sensitive to market interest rates, as its assets reprice more quickly to changes in interest rates than do its liabilities. Interest rates dropped by the unprecedented amount of 400 basis\npoints during 2008 as the Federal Reserve, through its Federal Open Market Committee, attempted to stabilize the financial markets, reduce the effects of the recession and stimulate the economy. These actions taken by the Federal Reserve continued to impact the Company\u2019s earnings in 2014. During 2010, the Federal Reserve increased the discount rate 25 basis points; however, there was no effect on the fed funds or prime interest rates. Discount or fed funds rate changes that occur in 2015 may affect the Company\u2019s earnings in the current year and/or in the future.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMany factors affect the demand for loans and the ability to attract deposits, including changes in government economic and monetary policies, particularly by the Federal Reserve, modifications to tax, banking and credit laws and regulations, national, state and local economic growth rates and employment rates. Previous legislation such as EESA and ARRA were passed to address issues facing certain financial institutions, improve the general availability of credit for consumers and businesses, stimulate the national economy and promote long-term growth and stability. Further regulation impacting the Company and its operations include The Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to increase transparency, accountability and oversight over financial firms and products as well as to provide protection to consumers. The new capital requirements under BASEL III raise minimum capital requirements, change the definition of capital, create a capital conservation buffer and increase risk weights for certain assets and exposures. There can be no assurance that EESA, ARRA, Dodd-Frank or BASEL III will achieve their intended purposes. Furthermore, their failure could result in continuing or worsening economic and market conditions, and this could adversely affect our operations.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Department of Banking. New regulations issued by these agencies, including but not limited to those relating to The Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to carry on its business activities. The Company is also subject to various other federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact the Company\u2019s business plans.\nThe Company is also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or results of operations of the Company and may also require additional effort or cost to implement.\nThe Company is subject to the requirements under The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to the assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s management is required to report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for each fiscal year end. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess internal controls are complex and require significant documentation and testing. In connection with this effort, the Company has and will continue to incur increased expenses and diversion of Management\u2019s time and other internal resources. If the Company cannot make the required report, investor confidence in the Company\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to anti-terrorism and money laundering legislation.\nThe Company is subject to the USA Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the \u201cOFAC\u201d). These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and account relationships, intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Noncompliance with these rules and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and may impact the Company\u2019s business plans.\nThe Company relies heavily on technology and computer systems, and disruptions of, failures of, advances in and changes in technology could significantly affect business.\nAs is customary in the banking industry, the Company is dependent upon automated and non-automated systems to record and process our transaction volume. This poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems by employees, customers or outsiders will result in losses. Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose the Company to reputational risk, the loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control, such as computer viruses, communication and energy disruption and unethical individuals with technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of data processing systems. The Company\u2019s ability to compete depends on the ability to continue to adapt to changes in technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet customers\u2019 demands.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nSecurities issued by the Company are not FDIC insured.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of the Bank and is not insured by the FDIC, the Bank Insurance Fund or any other government agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer and is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nThe directors of the Company and executive management own a significant number of shares of stock, allowing further control over business and corporate affairs.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 9% of the outstanding common stock of Peoples Financial Corporation. As a result, in addition to their day-to-day management roles, they will be able to exercise significant influence on the Company\u2019s business as shareholders, including influence over election of the Board and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws, Mississippi law and state and federal banking regulations could delay or prevent a takeover by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and of state and federal law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Company. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Company\u2019s shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take in to account several factors, including the resources of the acquirer and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There are also Mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in the Company\u2019s articles and bylaws could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquirer.\nThe Company\u2019s future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nSince the Company is a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, the Company has no material source of funds other than dividends received from the Bank. Therefore, the ability to pay dividends to the shareholders will depend on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Moreover, banks and bank holding companies are both subject to certain federal and state regulatory restrictions on cash dividends. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC must approve the declaration and payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank, respectively.", "PERMNO": 88257, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PFBX"}
