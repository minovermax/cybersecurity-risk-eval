Our results of operations can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by risks and uncertainties known or unknown to us. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the forward-looking statements. Actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations and assumptions. While we cannot identify all of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from our expectations, we believe the following factors should be considered carefully:\nAn unfavorable outcome in our pending litigation matter with WesternGeco could have a materially adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.\nIn June 2009, WesternGeco L.L.C. (\u201cWesternGeco\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d). In the lawsuit, styled WesternGeco L.L.C. v. ION Geophysical Corporation, WesternGeco alleged that we infringed four of their patents concerning marine seismic surveys.\nTrial began in July 2012, and the jury returned a verdict in August 2012. The jury found that we infringed on six \u201cclaims\u201d contained in four of WesternGeco\u2019s patents by supplying our DigiFIN lateral streamer control units from the United States. (In patent law, a \u201cclaim\u201d is a technical legal term; an infringer infringes on one or more \u201cclaims\u201d of a given patent.)\nIn May 2014, the District Court entered a Final Judgment against us in the amount of $123.8 million. The Final Judgment also enjoined us from supplying DigiFINs or any parts unique to DigiFINs in or from the United States. We conducted our business in compliance with the District Court\u2019s orders, and have reorganized our operations such that we no longer supply DigiFINs or any parts unique to DigiFINs in or from the United States.\nAs of 2018, we paid WesternGeco the $25.8 million of the Final Judgment (the portion of the judgment representing reasonable royalty damages and enhanced damages, plus interest).\nHowever, as further described below, the balance of the judgment against us ($98.0 million, representing lost profits from surveys performed by our customers outside of the United States, plus interest) has been vacated, and a new trial ordered, to determine what lost profit damages, if any, WesternGeco is entitled to.\nThe Final Judgment was vacated after it was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. (the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d), then to the Supreme Court of the United States, which remanded the case, again, to the Court of Appeals.\nOn January 11, 2019, the Court of Appeals refused to disturb the award of reasonable royalties to WesternGeco (which the Company paid in 2016), but did not reinstate the lost profits award; rather, the Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether to hold a new trial as to lost profits.\nOn August 30, 2019, the District Court refused WesternGeco\u2019s request to reinstate the lost profits awards against us, and instead ordered a new trial to determine what lost profits, if any, WesternGeco is entitled to from surveys performed by our customers outside of the United States.\nThe District Court\u2019s basis for granting the new trial as to lost profits was that, subsequent to the jury verdict that awarded lost profits, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) of the Patent and Trademark Office, in an administrative proceeding, invalidated four of the five patent claims that formed the basis for the lost profits judgment against us (that is, the PTAB held that those four patent claims should never have been granted), and the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court both subsequently refused to overturn that finding. A trial date for the new trial has not yet been set.\nWe may not ultimately prevail in the litigation and we could be required to pay lost profits if and when a new judgment issues in the new trial. Our assessment that we do not have a loss contingency may change in the future due to developments at the District Court, and other events, such as changes in applicable law, and such reassessment could lead to the determination that a significant loss contingency is probable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the level of exploration and production activities by the oil and natural gas industry. If capital expenditures by E&P companies decline, typically because of lower price realizations for oil and natural gas, the demand for our services and products would decline and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nDemand for our services and products depends upon the level of spending by E&P companies and seismic contractors for exploration and production activities, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices. Spending by our customers on services and products that we provide is highly discretionary in nature, and subject to rapid and material change. Any decline in oil and gas related spending on behalf of our customers could cause alterations in our capital spending plans, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions or delays in payment, or non-payment of amounts that are owed to us, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. E&P companies\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline for current production;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area, as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic data acquisition;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\npublic health crises, such as the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of 2020;\n\u2022\nchanges in government leadership;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and gas producing countries;\n\u2022\ntechnical advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies regarding the exploration, production and development of oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas companies and seismic contractors; and\n\u2022\ncompliance by members of the OPEC and non-OPEC members, such as Russia, with agreements to cut oil production.\nThe level of oil and gas exploration and production activity has been volatile in recent years. Trends in oil and gas exploration and development activities have declined, together with demand for our services and products. Any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely further affect oil and gas production levels and therefore adversely affect demand for the services we provide and products we sell.\nOur operating results often fluctuate from period to period as we are subject to cyclicality and seasonality factors.\nOur industry and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to cyclical fluctuations. Demand for our services and products depends upon spending levels by E&P companies for exploration and production of oil and natural gas and, in the case of new seismic data acquisition, the willingness of those companies to forgo ownership of the seismic data. Capital expenditures by E&P companies for these activities depend upon several factors, including actual and forecasted prices of oil and natural gas and those companies\u2019 short-term and strategic plans.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations from period to period as a result of introducing new services and products, the timing of significant expenses in connection with customer orders, unrealized sales, levels of research and development activities, the product and service mix of our revenues, the seasonality of our business (with strongest demand typically in the second half of the year) and delays caused by factors beyond our control. Because some of our products are technologically complex and tend to be relatively large investments, we generally experience long sales cycles for these types of products with a series of technical and commercial reviews by our customers and historically incur significant expense at the beginning of these cycles. Our revenues and gross margin can vary widely from period to period due to changes in customer requirements and demand as well as timing of orders and shipments and mix of services and products sold. This uneven pattern makes financial predictions for any given period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places challenges on our inventory management. As a result, if net revenues or gross margins fall below expectations, our results of operations and financial condition will likely be materially adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $121.5 million, consisting of approximately $120.6 million outstanding Senior Secured Second-Priority Notes (\u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d), $1.9 million of equipment finance lease obligations and $1.0 million of other short-term debt, partially offset by $2.0 million of debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facility. Under our Credit Facility, the lender has committed $50.0 million of revolving credit, subject to a borrowing base. At December 31, 2019, we had $39.3 million of borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility. The amount available will increase or decrease monthly as our borrowing base changes. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn February 2019, S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d) maintained our corporate credit rating of CCC+ and revised their outlook from a negative to stable. S&P\u2019s outlook revision reflects our improved liquidity and expected improving financial measures due to an expected increase in international capital spending. Following the redemption of our Third Lien Notes in March 2018, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has withdrawn all assigned public credit ratings on our Company, including the Caa2 Corporate Family Rating.\nOur high level of indebtedness could have negative consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions could increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general could be limited;\n\u2022\nour amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nour customers may react adversely to our significant debt level and seek or develop alternative licensors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nwe may have insufficient funds, and our debt level may also restrict us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all of the Notes, as defined below, tendered to us upon the occurrence of a change of control, which would constitute an event of default under the Notes; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nOur level of indebtedness will require that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, research and development and other general corporate or business activities.\nIf we are unable to raise additional working capital, we will be unable to fully fund our operations and to otherwise execute our strategic objectives.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had a negative working capital of $23.6 million. Should our costs and expenses prove to be greater than we currently anticipate, or should we change our current operating plan in a manner that will increase or accelerate our anticipated costs and expenses, the depletion of our working capital would be accelerated. In addition, if we do not generate sufficient revenues to cover our working capital requirements, our operations could be severely affected. To the extent it becomes necessary to raise additional cash in the future as s result of current cash and working capital resources being depleted, we would draw on our credit facility, of which $39.3 million was available to borrow at December 31, 2019. We may also seek to raise additional working capital through the public or private sale of assets, issuance of debt or equity securities and debt financing or short-term loans, or a combination of the foregoing. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure the additional cash or working capital we may require to continue our operations and to fully implement our operating plan.\nWe are subject to intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or to maintain our prices at profitable levels.\nMany of our sales are obtained through a competitive bidding process, which is standard for our industry. Competitive factors in recent years have included price, technological expertise, and a reputation for quality, safety and dependability. While no single company competes with us in all of our segments, we are subject to intense competition in each of our segments. New entrants in many of the markets in which certain of our services and products are currently strong should be expected. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d We compete with companies that are larger than we are in terms of revenues, technical personnel, number of processing locations and sales and marketing resources. A few of our competitors have a competitive advantage in being part of a large affiliated seismic contractor company. In addition, we compete with major service providers and government-sponsored enterprises and affiliates. Some of our competitors conduct seismic data acquisition operations as part of their regular business, which we have traditionally not conducted, and have greater financial and other resources than we do. These and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, as well as changes in government regulations. In addition, any excess supply of services and products in the seismic services market could apply downward pressure on prices for our services and products. The negative effects of the competitive environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In particular, the consolidation in recent years of many of our competitors in the seismic services and products markets has negatively impacted our results of operations.\nThere are a number of geophysical companies that create, market and license seismic data and maintain seismic libraries. Competition for acquisition of new seismic data among geophysical service providers historically has been intense and we expect this competition will continue to be intense. Larger and better-financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for new data.\nThe indentures governing the 9.125% Second Lien Notes due 2021 contain a number of restrictive covenants that limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.\nThe indenture governing the Second Lien Notes imposes, (and the terms of any future indebtedness could impose) operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions affect, or will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nredeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell certain kinds of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\neffect mergers or consolidations.\nThe restrictions contained in the indenture governing the Second Lien Notes could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the Second Lien Notes. If an event of default occurs, the trustee and holders of the Second Lien Notes could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. An event of default under the indenture governing the Second Lien Notes would also constitute an event of default under our Credit Facility. In addition, if we are unable to repay or extend the maturity of our Second Lien Notes prior to their scheduled maturity in December 2021, the maturity of our Credit Facility, which currently matures in August 2023, will accelerate to mature in October 2021 which may cause us to face substantial liquidity problems and may force us to reduce or delay investments, dispose of material assets or operations, or issue additional debt or equity. See Footnote 5 \u201cLong-term Debt\u201d of the Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing below in this Form 10-K.\nAs a technology-focused company, we are continually exposed to risks related to complex, highly technical services and products that are sometimes operated in dangerous marine environments.\nWe make strategic decisions from time to time as to the technologies in which we invest. Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to improve and refine our seismic imaging and data processing services and to successfully develop, manufacture and market our products and services. New technologies generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability. If we choose the wrong technology, or if our competitors develop or select a superior technology, we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new customers, which would harm our business and operations.\nThe markets for our services and products are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions. We must invest substantial capital to develop and maintain a leading edge in technology, with no assurance that we will receive an adequate rate of return on those investments. If we are unable to develop and produce successfully and timely new or enhanced services and products, we will be unable to compete in the future and our business, our results of operations and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Our business could suffer from unexpected developments in technology, or from our failure to adapt to these changes. In addition, the preferences and requirements of customers can change rapidly.\nThe businesses of our E&P Technology & Services segment and Optimization Software & Services group within our Operations Optimization segment, being more concentrated in software, processing services and proprietary technologies, have also exposed us to various risks that these technologies typically encounter, including the following:\n\u2022\nfuture competition from more established companies entering the market;\n\u2022\ntechnology obsolescence;\n\u2022\ndependence upon continued growth of the market for seismic data processing;\n\u2022\nthe rate of change in the markets for these segments\u2019 technology and services;\n\u2022\nfurther consolidation of the participants within this market;\n\u2022\nresearch and development efforts not proving sufficient to keep up with changing market demands;\n\u2022\ndependence on third-party software for inclusion in these segments\u2019 services and products;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of these segments\u2019 technology by other companies;\n\u2022\nalleged or actual infringement of intellectual property rights that could result in substantial additional costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties inherent in forecasting sales for newly developed technologies or advancements in technologies;\n\u2022\nrecruiting, training and retaining technically skilled, experienced personnel that could increase the costs for these segments, or limit their growth; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain traditional margins for certain of their technology or services.\nSeismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed rather rapidly and we expect this progression to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition and processing capabilities. However, due to potential advances in technology and the related costs associated with such technological advances, we may not be able to fulfill this strategy, thus possibly affecting our ability to compete. New data acquisition or processing technologies may be developed. New and enhanced services and products introduced by one of our competitors may gain market acceptance and, if not available to us, may adversely affect us.\nOur customers often require demanding specifications for performance and reliability of our services and products. Because many of our products are complex and often use unique advanced components, processes, technologies and techniques, undetected errors and design and manufacturing flaws may occur. Even though we attempt to assure that our systems are always reliable in the field, the many technical variables related to their operations can cause a combination of factors that can, and have from time to time, caused performance and service issues with certain of our products. Product defects result in higher product service, warranty and replacement costs and may affect our customer relationships and industry reputation, all of which may adversely impact our results of operations. Despite our testing and quality assurance programs, undetected errors may not be discovered until the product is purchased and used by a customer in a variety of field conditions. If our customers deploy our new products and they do not work correctly, our relationship with our customers may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of our systems\u2019 advanced and complex nature, we expect to experience occasional operational issues from time to time. Generally, until our products have been tested in the field under a wide variety of operational conditions, we cannot be certain that performance and service problems will not arise. In that case, market acceptance of our new products could be delayed and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe also face exposure to product liability claims in the event that certain of our products, or certain components manufactured by others that are incorporated into our products, fail to perform to specification, which failure results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. Marine exploration in particular can present dangerous conditions to those conducting it. Any product liability claims decided adversely against us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant sums of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our E&P Technology & Services\u2019 multi-client data library, without knowing precisely how much of this seismic data we will be able to license or when and at what price we will be able to license the data sets. Our business could be adversely affected by the failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for the underwritten portion of our seismic data acquisition costs for our multi-client library.\nWe invest significant amounts in acquiring and processing new seismic data to add to our E&P Technology & Services\u2019 multi-client data library. The costs of most of these investments are funded by our customers, with the remainder generally being recovered through future data licensing fees. In 2019, we invested approximately $28.8 million in our multi-client data library. Our customers generally commit to licensing the data prior to our initiating a new data library acquisition program. However, the aggregate amounts of future licensing fees for this data are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors, including the market prices of oil and gas, customer demand for seismic data in the library, and the availability of similar data from competitors.\nBy making these investments in acquiring and processing new seismic data for our E&P Technology & Services\u2019 multi-client library, we are exposed to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may not fully recover our costs of acquiring and processing seismic data through future sales. The ultimate amounts involved in these data sales are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\u2022\nThe timing of these sales is unpredictable and can vary greatly from period to period. The costs of each survey are capitalized and then amortized as a percentage of sales and/or on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the data. This amortization will affect our earnings and, when combined with the sporadic nature of sales, will result in increased earnings volatility.\n\u2022\nRegulatory changes that affect companies\u2019 ability to drill, either generally or in a specific location where we have acquired seismic data, could materially adversely affect the value of the seismic data contained in our library. Technology changes could also make existing data sets obsolete. Additionally, each of our individual surveys has a limited book life based on its location and oil and gas companies\u2019 interest in prospecting for reserves in such location, so a particular survey may be subject to a significant decline in value beyond our initial estimates.\n\u2022\nThe value of our multi-client data could be significantly adversely affected if any material adverse change occurs in the general prospects for oil and gas exploration, development and production activities.\n\u2022\nThe cost estimates upon which we base our pre-commitments of funding could be wrong. The result could be losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These pre-commitments of funding are subject to the creditworthiness of our customers. In the event that a client refuses or is unable to pay its commitment, we could incur a substantial loss on that project.\n\u2022\nAs part of our asset-light strategy, we routinely charter vessels from third-party vendors to acquire seismic data for our multi-client business. As a result, our cost to acquire our multi-client data could significantly increase if vessel charter prices rise materially.\nReductions in demand for our seismic data, or lower revenues of or cash flows from our seismic data, may result in a requirement to increase amortization rates or record impairment charges in order to reduce the carrying value of our data library. These increases or charges, if required, could be material to our operating results for the periods in which they are recorded.\nA substantial portion of our seismic acquisition project costs (including third-party project costs) are underwritten by our customers. In the event that underwriters for such projects fail to fulfill their obligations with respect to such underwriting commitments, we would continue to be obligated to satisfy our payment obligations to third-party contractors.\nWe derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales, which pose additional risks.\nThe majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales to customer destinations outside of North America represented 73%, 75% and 76% of our consolidated net revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that export sales will remain a significant percentage of our revenues. U.S. export restrictions affect the types and specifications of products we can export. Additionally, in order to complete certain sales, U.S. laws may require us to obtain export licenses, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining these licenses.\nLike many energy services companies, we have operations in and sales into certain international areas, including parts of the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, India, Asia Pacific and Russia, that are subject to risks of war, political disruption, civil disturbance, political corruption, public health crises, possible economic and legal sanctions (such as possible restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may in the future consider to be state sponsors of terrorism) and changes in global trade policies. Our sales or operations may become restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur. In particular, the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events, which in turn, could materially and adversely impact our results of operations:\n\u2022\ndisruption of E&P activities;\n\u2022\nrestriction on the movement and exchange of funds;\n\u2022\ninhibition of our ability to collect advances and receivables;\n\u2022\nenactment of additional or stricter U.S. government or international sanctions;\n\u2022\nlimitation of our access to markets for periods of time;\n\u2022\nexpropriation and nationalization of assets of our company or those of our customers;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, which may include armed conflict and civil disturbance;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions;\n\u2022\nconfiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights, including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems.\nOur international operations and sales increase our exposure to other countries\u2019 restrictive tariff regulations, other import/export restrictions and customer credit risk.\nIn addition, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nWe may be unable to obtain broad intellectual property protection for our current and future products and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes; we rely on developing and acquiring proprietary data which we keep confidential.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies. We believe that the technological and creative skill of our employees, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are the foundations of our competitive advantage. Although we have a considerable portfolio of patents, copyrights and trademarks, these property rights offer us only limited protection. Our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, or may design around the proprietary features of our products. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult, and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs. Our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the United States.\nThird parties inquire and claim from time to time that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors own their own extensive global portfolio of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property to protect their proprietary technologies. We believe that we have in place appropriate procedures and safeguards to help ensure that we do not violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. However, no set of procedures and safeguards is infallible. We may unknowingly and inadvertently take action that is inconsistent with a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, despite our efforts to do otherwise. Any such claims from third parties, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, result in injunctions, require product modifications, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMuch of our litigation in recent years have involved disputes over ours and others\u2019 rights to technology. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nTo protect the confidentiality of our proprietary and trade secret information, we require employees, consultants, contractors, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. Our customer data license and acquisition agreements also identify our proprietary, confidential information and require that such proprietary information be kept confidential. While these steps are taken to strictly maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary and trade secret information, it is difficult to ensure that unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure will not occur. If we are unable to maintain the secrecy of our proprietary, confidential information, we could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage our transition into new services, products and adjacent markets, our revenues may suffer.\nServices and products for our business are characterized by rapid technological advances and innovation in hardware performance, software functionality and features, frequent introduction of new services and products, and improvement in price characteristics relative to product and service performance. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new services and products and diversification to new markets are delays in development or manufacturing, variations in costs, customer acceptance, delays in customer purchases, reductions in price or replacing sales of existing products in anticipation of new offerings, write-offs or write-downs of the carrying costs of materials associated with prior generation products, difficulty in predicting customer demand due to competition, risks associated with customer qualification, evaluation of new products, quality issues or other defects that may not be adequately supported by application software and untimely commercialization. In addition, it may be difficult to ensure performance of new services and products in accordance with our revenue, margin and cost estimations and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates. If any of these risks materializes or if we do not make an effective transition, our revenues and results of operations, may suffer.\nGlobal economic conditions and credit market uncertainties could have an adverse effect on customer demand for certain of our services and products, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial condition and our stock price.\nHistorically, demand for our services and products has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by E&P companies and geophysical contractors. The demand for our services and products will be lessened if exploration expenditures by E&P companies are reduced. During periods of reduced levels of exploration for oil and natural gas, there have been oversupplies of seismic data and downward pricing pressures on our seismic services and products, which, in turn, have limited our ability to meet sales objectives and maintain profit margins for our services and products. In the past, these then-prevailing industry conditions have had the effect of reducing our revenues and operating margins. The markets for oil and gas historically have been volatile and may continue to be so in the future.\nTurmoil or uncertainty in the credit markets and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings under either existing or new debt facilities in the public or private markets and on terms we believe to be reasonable. Likewise, there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money for their working capital or capital expenditures on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, which could have a negative impact on their demand for our services and products and impair their ability to pay us for our services and products on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur sales have historically been affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity, and we and our customers would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe loss of any significant customer or the inability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. In 2019, we had one multinational oil customer with sales that exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues. In 2018, we had two customers with sales that each exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues and we had one customer with sales that exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues for 2017. Our top five customers together accounted for approximately 40%, 39% and 34% of our consolidated net revenues during 2019, 2018 and 2017. The loss of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny consolidation or strategic change made by our customers may impact the demand for our services and products. The loss of any of our significant customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is exposed to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Declines in commodity prices, and the credit markets could cause the availability of credit to be constrained. The combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity\nfinancing may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidity may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur stock price has been volatile, declining and increasing from time to time.\nThe securities markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions (such as changes in interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets) but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects or those of companies in our industry. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\nthe inherent lumpiness and volatility of our customers\u2019 spending cycles;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfactors influencing the levels of global oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities, such as the decline in crude oil prices and changes in oil and gas supply and demand;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us;\n\u2022\nactions by rating agencies related to the Notes; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors.\nIf the price of our common stock declines, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. A low price for our equity may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans. In addition, the volatility in the market price of our common stock affects the value of our stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d). To the extent that the price of our common stock increases, the value of our SARs will increase and could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows.\nGoodwill and other long-lived assets (multi-client data library and property, plant and equipment) that we have recorded are subject to impairment evaluations. In addition, our product inventory may become obsolete or excessive due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations. Write-downs of these assets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in or an impairment of the value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets would result in additional charges against our earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods. At December 31, 2019, our remaining goodwill, multi-client data library and property, plant and equipment balances were $23.6 million, $60.4 million and $13.2 million, respectively. For 2019, we wrote down our multi-client data library by $9.1 million resulting from our annual impairment review. For 2018, we recognized an impairment of $36.6 million in property, plant and equipment for our cable-based ocean bottom acquisition technologies.\nOur services and products\u2019 technologies often change relatively quickly. Phasing out of old products involves estimating the amounts of inventories we need to hold to satisfy demand for those products and satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing technologies and customer demand, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nDue to the international scope of our business activities, our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations.\nWe derived approximately 73% of our 2019 consolidated net revenues from international sales, subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States. We operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico, China, Canada, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and other countries. Certain of these countries have experienced geopolitical instability, economic problems and other uncertainties from time to time. To the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world, or the collectability of receivables, our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe currently require customers in certain higher risk countries to provide their own financing. We do not currently extend long-term credit through notes to companies in countries where we perceive excessive credit risk.\nOur foreign subsidiaries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies. To the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in their local currencies, a devaluation of those currencies versus the U.S. dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. For financial reporting purposes, such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since earnings denominated in foreign currencies would be converted to U.S. dollars at a decreased value. In addition, since we participate in competitive bids for sales of certain of our services and products that are denominated in U.S. dollars, a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could harm our competitive position relative to other companies. While we periodically employ economic cash flow and fair value hedges to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations, the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel in our businesses, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our businesses. Competition for qualified personnel required for our data processing operations and our other businesses has intensified recently. Our growth has presented challenges to us to recruit, train and retain our employees while managing the impact of potential wage inflation and the lack of available qualified labor in some markets where we operate. A well-trained, motivated and adequately-staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nCertain of our facilities could be damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our facilities are located in regions of the United States that are susceptible to damage from hurricanes and other weather events.\nFuture hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities may negatively affect our financial position and operating results for those periods. These negative effects may include reduced production, product sales and data processing revenues; costs associated with resuming production; reduced orders for our services and products from customers that were similarly affected by these events; lost market share; late deliveries; additional costs to purchase materials and supplies from outside suppliers; uninsured property losses; inadequate business interruption insurance and an inability to retain necessary staff. To the extent that climate change increases the severity of hurricanes and other weather events, as some have suggested, it could worsen the severity of these negative effects on our financial position and operating results.\nOur operations, and the operations of our customers, are subject to numerous government regulations, which could adversely limit our operating flexibility. Regulatory initiatives undertaken from time to time, such as restrictions, sanctions and embargoes, can adversely affect, and have adversely affected, our customers and our business.\nIn addition to the specific regulatory risks discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our operations are subject to other laws, regulations, government policies and product certification requirements worldwide. Changes in such laws, regulations, policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or services or result in the need to modify our services and products, which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. Our export activities in particular are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations. . We have multiple product lines and services that are sold in many countries throughout the world. Certain countries are subject to restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed by the United States government. These restrictions, sanctions and embargoes also prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries. Violation of these rules could result in significant penalties. In addition, our operations are subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties, and the protection of the environment. These laws have been changed frequently in the past, and there can be no assurance that future changes will not have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our customers\u2019 operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species. Consequently, changes in governmental regulations applicable to our customers may reduce demand for our services and products. To the extent that our customers\u2019 operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOffshore oil and gas exploration and development recently has been a regulatory focus. Future changes in laws or regulations regarding such activities, and decisions by customers, governmental agencies or other industry participants in response, could reduce demand for our services and products, which could have a negative impact on our financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows. We cannot reasonably or reliably estimate that such changes will occur, when they will occur, or whether they will impact us. Such changes can occur quickly within a region, which may impact both the affected region and global exploration and production, and we may not be able to respond quickly, or at all, to mitigate these changes. In addition, these future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions that may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and decrease the demand for our services and products.\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements. Local, state, and federal agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nWe have outsourcing arrangements with third parties to manufacture some of our products. If these third party suppliers fail to deliver quality products or components at reasonable prices on a timely basis, we may alienate some of our customers and our revenues, profitability and cash flow may decline. Additionally, current global economic conditions could have a negative impact on our suppliers, causing a disruption in our vendor supplies. A disruption in vendor supplies may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes require us to purchase quality components. In addition, we use contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products. We have outsourced the manufacturing of our products, including our towed marine streamers, geophone manufacturing. Certain components used in our towed marine manufacturing operations are currently provided by a single supplier. Without these sole suppliers, we would be required to find other suppliers who could build these components for us, or set up to make these parts internally. If, in implementing any outsource initiative, we are unable to identify contract manufacturers willing to contract with us on competitive terms and to devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us or if we do not properly manage these relationships, our existing customer relationships may suffer. In addition, by undertaking these activities, we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our services and products may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules. We also may experience supply interruptions, cost escalations and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop, implement, or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers.\nReliance on certain suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involves several risks, including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key components, increases in component costs and reduced control over delivery schedules. If any of these risks are realized, our revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline. In addition, the more we come to rely on contract manufacturers, we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage problems that may arise from these third-party arrangements.\nAdditionally, our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies to us or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nThreats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risk and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. It is also possible that breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disseminating of highly confidential information, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers\u2019 operations, loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and certain contractual obligations under our agreement with BGP contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and the terms of our investor rights agreement with BGP may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, the terms of our INOVA Geophysical joint venture with BGP and BGP\u2019s investment in our company contain a number of provisions, such as certain pre-emptive rights granted to BGP with respect to certain future issuances of our stock, that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of our company that our stockholders may otherwise consider to be favorable.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nIf, in the future, we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nNote: The foregoing factors pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should not be construed as exhaustive. In addition to the foregoing, we wish to refer readers to other factors discussed elsewhere in this report as well as other filings and reports with the SEC for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect the events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "PERMNO": 76613, "SIC": 1382, "TIC": "IO"}
