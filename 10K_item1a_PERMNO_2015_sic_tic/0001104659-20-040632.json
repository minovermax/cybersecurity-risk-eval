RISK FACTORS\nOur future operating results may vary substantially from anticipated results due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations. If any of the following factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be able to generate a positive return on shareholders\u2019 investment; there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe had a net loss of $3.8 million, $3.8 million, and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of March 30, 2020 we had approximately $1.2 million of cash. The Agreement with AD Pharma provides us monthly license payments of $350,000 from July 2019 through November 2020 as well as reimbursement for all outside development costs for LTX-03. However, AD Pharma has the right to terminate the Agreement at any time for convenience and such action would substantially and adversely affect our ability to fund continuing operations. Our future viability will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 the receipt of monthly license payments from AD Pharma for the entire18 month period ending November 30, 2020; and\n\u00b7 our receipt of royalties relating to Zyla\u2019s sale of Oxaydo, of which no assurance can be given; and\n\u00b7 MainPointe\u2019s successful marketing and sale of our Nexafed products and other products utilizing our Impede Technology, and market acceptance, increased demand for and sales of our Nexafed products, of which no assurance can be given; and\n\u00b7 our receipt of milestone payments and royalties relating to our LIMITx Technology products in development from future licensees, of which no assurance can be given; and\n\u00b7 the receipt of FDA approval and the successful commercialization by future licensees, yet to be identified and obtained, of products utilizing our LIMITx Technology and our ability to commercialize our Impede Technology without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, of which no assurance can be given.\nWe are currently focused primarily on the development of our lead LIMITx product candidate, LTX-03, as well as our other LIMITx programs, which we believe will result in our continued incurrence of significant research, development and other expenses related to those programs. If preclinical studies or the clinical trials for any of our LIMITx drug candidates fail or produce unsuccessful results and those drug candidates do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our LIMITx drug candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become self-supporting resulting in significant doubt as to our ability to sustain operations.\nWe cannot assure you that Oxaydo or our Nexafed products will be successfully commercialized or our LIMITx Technology or Impede Technology products in development will be successfully developed or be approved for commercialization by the FDA.\nEven if Zyla succeeds in commercializing Oxaydo, if MainPointe is successful in commercializing our Nexafed products, or if we and AD Pharma succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our pipeline LIMITx or Impede Technology products, we expect to continue using cash reserves for the foreseeable future. Our expenses may increase in the foreseeable future as a result of continued research and development of these and other product candidates, maintaining and expanding the scope of our intellectual property, and hiring of additional research and development staff.\nWe will need to generate revenues from royalties on sales to achieve and maintain liquidity. If Zyla does not successfully commercialize Oxaydo, if MainPointe does not successfully commercialize the Nexafed products, or if we or AD Pharma cannot successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our LIMITx product candidates in development, specifically LTX-03, we will not be able to generate such royalty revenues or achieve future profitability. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.\nWe will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern\u037e we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us; if we fail to raise additional funding we will cease operations and/or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nOur operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Negative cash flows from our operations currently are expected to continue over at least the next several years. Our cash utilization amount is highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies of our LIMITx product candidates and the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our LIMITx product candidates. In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time. As of March 30, 2020 our cash balance was approximately $1.2 million. Additionally, the Agreement with AD Pharma calls for monthly license payments of $350,000 from July 2019 through November 2020 and as well as their payment of all outside development costs for LTX-03. To fund further operations, we must raise additional financing or enter into license or collaboration agreements with third parties relating to our technologies.\nWe will require future additional capital infusions including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates. However, there can be no assurances that we will complete any financings, strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements, and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or have other provisions, including possibly security interests in our assets that could be onerous. If we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. Our failure to raise capital when needed would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In the absence of the receipt of additional financing or payments under third-party license or collaborative agreements, we will be required to scale back or terminate operations and/or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. This could result in a complete loss of shareholder value of the Company. Even assuming we are successful in securing additional sources of financing to fund continued operations, there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such financing will be sufficient to fund operations until such time, if at all, that we generate sufficient revenue from our products and product candidate to sustain and grow our operations.\nOur ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, which likely will require that we continue to obtain capital infusions in the future. Our capital requirements, which cannot be predicted with certainty, include: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our LIMITx product candidates under development; the costs of complying with the FDA and other domestic regulatory agency requirements, the progress of our research and development programs and those of our partners; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements that we undertake; and the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the FDA approved label for any product.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where third parties for which we rely, as in CROs or CMOs, have significant research, development or manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, causing disruption in supplies and services.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where third parties for which we rely, as in CROs or CMOs, have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and CROs upon whom we rely. On January 30, 202 0, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the \u201cCOVID-19 outbreak\u201d) and the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the world. The spread of this pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets. This could result in an economic downturn and may disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. Any manufacturing supply interruption of materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future research and manufacturing activities of LTX-03.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, the ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 and adversely impact our clinical trial operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our loan with AD Pharma, LLC they may accelerate amounts owed and may foreclose upon the security interest in all of our assets securing our obligation.\nAt June 28, 2019, we (including our wholly-owned subsidiary Acura Pharmaceutical Technologies, Inc. (\u201cAPT\u201d)), entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement with John Schutte (Mr. Schutte) that consolidated existing promissory notes into a single Note for $6.0 million (after including accrued interest). To secure our performance of our obligations under the Note, we granted Mr. Schutte a security interest in all of our assets. Our failure to comply with the terms of the loan agreement, if we file bankruptcy, failure to pay interest and principal when due on July 1, 2023, or upon failure to meet certain timelines as defined in the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement could result in the acceleration of payment of our loan, foreclosure on our assets, and other adverse results. With our consent, Mr. Schutte assigned and transferred to Abuse Deterrent Pharma, LLC (\u201cAD Pharma\u201d) (an entity controlled by him, all of his right, title and interest in this Note and associated Security Agreement effective June 28, 2019. Any declaration of an event of default by AD Pharma could result in the transfer of our business to AD Pharma without additional consideration and the loss by our shareholders of their entire interest.\nWe are largely dependent on our successful development of our LIMITx product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on our successful development of our LTX-03 as licensed to AD Pharma and potentially other LIMITx product candidates and on the commercial success of our only FDA approved product, Oxaydo, of which no assurance can be given We expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years, if we obtain additional funding, will be devoted to our lead LIMITx product candidate, LTX-03, and other LIMITx product candidates in development. We completed our first two Phase I clinical studies for LTX-04, an opioid hydromorphone HCI, in mid-2016. We have changed our primary development focus from immediate-release hydromorphone products (i.e., LTX-04, described above) to immediate-release hydrocodone products (i.e., LTX-03) because hydrocodone bitartrate is more likely to be abused in oral excessive tablet abuse, or ETA, and completed two pharmokinetic studies for LTX-03 during 2017 and the first week of 2018. We are also engaged in formulation development or early preclinical development for other LIMITx product candidates. Accordingly, our business is currently substantially dependent on the successful development, clinical testing, regulatory approval and commercialization of our LIMITx product candidates, which may never occur. If our clinical studies for LTX-03 are not successful we may determine that further clinical development of LTX-03 or other LIMITx product candidates should be discontinued. Also, the failure of clinical studies for LTX-03 may cause AD Pharma to terminate the Agreement. We expect that any revenues from our LIMITx product candidates, specifically LTX-03 will be derived from upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties under license agreements with AD Pharma, of which no assurance can be given.\nIf MainPointe/AD Pharma is not successful in commercializing our Nexafed Products, our revenues and business will suffer.\nOur Nexafed products compete in the highly competitive market for cold, sinus and allergy products generally available to the consumer without a prescription. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources and are able to expend more funds and effort than MainPointe in marketing their competing products. Category leading brands are often supported by regional and national advertising and promotional efforts. Our Nexafed products compete with national brands as well as pharmacy store brands that are offered at a lower price. There can be no assurance that MainPointe will succeed in commercializing our Nexafed products, or that the pricing of our Nexafed products will allow us to generate significant royalty revenues. Regulations have been enacted in several state or local jurisdictions requiring a doctor\u2019s prescription to obtain pseudoephedrine products. An expansion of such restrictions to other jurisdictions or even nationally will adversely impact MainPointe\u2019s ability to market our Nexafed products as over-the-counter, or OTC, products and negatively impact royalty payments to us from Nexafed products sales. There can be no assurance that MainPointe will devote sufficient resources to marketing and commercialization of our Nexafed products. MainPointe\u2019s failure to successfully commercialize our Nexafed\u00ae products may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf Zyla is not successful in commercializing Oxaydo, our revenues and our business will suffer.\nPursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Zyla, or the Zyla Agreement, Zyla is responsible for manufacturing, marketing, pricing, promotion, selling and distribution of Oxaydo. If the Zyla Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, including due to a party\u2019s failure to perform its obligations or responsibilities under the Agreement, then we would need to commercialize Oxaydo ourselves, for which we currently have no infrastructure, or alternatively enter into a new agreement with another pharmaceutical company, of which no assurance can be given. If we are unable to build the necessary infrastructure to commercialize Oxaydo ourselves, which would substantially increase our expenses and capital requirements, which we are currently unable to fund, or are unable to find a suitable replacement commercialization partner, we would be unable to generate any revenue from Oxaydo. Even if we are successful at replacing the commercialization capabilities of Zyla, our revenues and/or royalties from Oxaydo could be adversely impacted.\nZyla\u2019s third party manufacturing facility currently is the sole commercial source of supply of Oxaydo. If Zyla\u2019s manufacturing facility fails to obtain sufficient DEA quotas for oxycodone, fails to source adequate quantities of active and inactive ingredients, fails to comply with regulatory requirements, or otherwise experiences disruptions in commercial supply of Oxaydo, product revenue and our royalties could be adversely impacted.\nZyla has various products in development and also markets other products, for which Oxaydo will vie for such licensee\u2019s development, promotional, marketing, and selling resources. If Zyla fails to commit sufficient promotional, marketing and selling resources to Oxaydo, our expected royalties could be adversely impacted. Additionally, there can be no assurance that Zyla will commit the resources required for the successful commercialization of Oxaydo.\nThe market for our opioid product candidates is highly competitive with many marketed non-abuse deterrent brand and generic products and other abuse deterrent product candidates in development. If Zyla prices Oxaydo inappropriately, fails to position Oxaydo properly, targets inappropriate physician specialties, or otherwise does not provide sufficient promotional support, product revenue and our royalties could be materially adversely impacted.\nZyla\u2019s promotional, marketing and sales activities in connection with Oxaydo are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. If Zyla\u2019s activities are found to be in violation of these laws or any other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, Zyla may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of its activities with regard to the commercialization of Oxaydo, which could harm the commercial success of Oxaydo and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to meet the development timelines in the License Agreement with AD Pharma, including FDA acceptance of NDA submission for LTX-03 by November 30, 2020, will allow AD Pharma the option to terminate the Agreement and take ownership of the LIMITx intellectual property which will adversely impact our ability to develop, market and sell our LIMITx Technology products and our revenues and business will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are engaged in the development of product candidates utilizing our LIMITx Technology, including planning studies for LTX-03, our hydrocodone/acetaminophen lead product candidate which has been licensed to AD Pharma. This License requires that the IND application for LTX-03 be accepted by the FDA within 18 months from June 28, 2019. Failure to do so gives AD Pharma the option to terminate this Agreement and take ownership of the LIMITx intellectual property. AD Pharma\u2019s seizure of the LIMITx IP would have a material adverse impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur and our licensees\u2019 ability to market and promote Oxaydo and LIMITx Technology products by describing the abuse deterrent or other beneficial features of such products will be determined by the FDA approved label for such products.\nThe commercial success of Oxaydo and our LIMITx Technology products in development will depend upon our and our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain FDA approved labeling describing such products\u2019 abuse deterrent features or other benefits. Our or our licensees\u2019 failure to achieve FDA approval of product labeling containing such information will prevent or substantially limit our and our licensees\u2019 advertising and promotion of such beneficial features in order to differentiate our products from other immediate release opioid products containing the same active ingredients, and would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In April 2015, the FDA published guidance for industry on the evaluation and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids. While the 2015 FDA Guidance is non-binding on the FDA, it outlines FDA\u2019s current thinking on the development and labeling of abuse-deterrent products. The 2015 FDA Guidance provides for three distinct levels of pre-marketing studies that are potentially eligible for inclusion in the labeling: (1) laboratory-based in vitro manipulation and extraction studies, (2) pharmacokinetic studies, and (3) clinical abuse potential studies. The 2015 FDA Guidance further prescribes additional post-approval or epidemiology studies to determine whether the marketing of a product with abuse-deterrent properties results in meaningful reductions in abuse, misuse, and related adverse clinical outcomes, including addiction, overdose, and death in the post-approval setting, which can also be included in the labeling. FDA notes \u201cthe science of abuse deterrence is relatively new. Both the technologies involved and the analytical, clinical, and statistical methods for evaluating those technologies are rapidly evolving. For these reasons, FDA will take a flexible, adaptive approach to the evaluation and labeling of potentially abuse-deterrent opioid products\u201d.\nWe or our licensee may seek to include descriptions of studies that characterize the abuse-deterrent properties or safety features in the label for our Aversion and LIMITx Technology products in development. We have committed to the FDA to undertake epidemiological studies to assess the actual consequences of abuse of Oxaydo in the market. However, the extent to which a description of the abuse deterrent properties or results of epidemiological or other studies will be added to or included in the FDA approved product label for our products in development will be the subject of our and our licensees\u2019 discussions with, and agreement by, the FDA as part of the new drug application, or NDA, review process for each of our product candidates. The outcome of those discussions with the FDA will determine whether we or our licensees will be able to market our products with labeling that sufficiently differentiates them from other products that have comparable therapeutic profiles. While the FDA approved label for Oxaydo includes the results from a clinical study which evaluated the effects of nasally snorting crushed Oxaydo and commercially available oxycodone tablets and limitations on wetting or dissolving Oxaydo, it does not, however, include the results of our laboratory studies intended to evaluate Oxaydo\u2019s potential to limit extraction of oxycodone HCl from dissolved Oxaydo Tablets and resist conversion into an injectable, or IV solution. According to filings made by Zyla, a supplemental new drug application (\u201csNDA\u201d) was submitted by Zyla in December 2016 for Oxaydo to support an abuse-deterrent label claim for the intravenous route of abuse, and in February 2017, Zyla filed a prior approval supplement (\u201cPAS\u201d) with data on new dosage strengths of 10 mg and 15 mg of Oxaydo. Zyla reported they received a complete response letter from the FDA in June of 2017 where the FDA requested more information regarding the effect of food on Oxaydo 15 mg and the intranasal abuse deterrent properties of Oxaydo 10 and 15 mg. Zyla reported that based on discussions with the FDA regarding the sNDA, Zyla believed a contemporary intranasal human abuse potential study would be needed to complete the sNDA, and given that the issues involved in the sNDA and PAS are intertwined, Zyla disclosed that they are evaluating their options and the costs associated to proceed on the abuse deterrent label and/or the additional dosage strengths. The absence of the results of these extraction and syringe studies in the FDA approved label for Oxaydo may substantially limit our licensee\u2019s ability to differentiate Oxaydo from other immediate release oxycodone products, which would have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of Oxaydo and on our business and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the FDA approved labeling for Oxaydo, there can be no assurance that our LIMITx Technology products in development will receive FDA approved labeling that describes the beneficial safety features of such products. If the FDA does not approve labeling containing such information, we or our licensees will not be able to promote such products based on their safety features, may not be able to differentiate such products from other immediate release opioid products containing the same active ingredients, and may not be able to charge a premium above the price of such other products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther, because the FDA closely regulates promotional materials and other promotional activities, even if the FDA initially approves product labeling that includes a description of the abuse deterrent characteristics of our product, as in the case of Oxaydo, the FDA\u2019s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, or OPDP, will continue to review the acceptability of promotional claims and product advertising campaigns for our marketed products. This could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of Oxaydo from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, which could harm the commercial success of our product and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates are unproven and may not be approved by the FDA.\nWe are committing a majority of our resources to the development of product candidates utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies. Notwithstanding the receipt of FDA approval of Oxaydo and our marketing of our Nexafed products, there can be no assurance that any product candidate utilizing our Impede or LIMITx Technologies will meet FDA\u2019s standards for commercial distribution. Further, there can be no assurance that other product candidates that may be developed using LIMITx, Impede or Aversion Technologies will achieve the targeted end points in the required clinical studies, demonstration of acceptable manufacturing, quality and product expiration standards, or perform as intended in other pre-clinical and clinical studies or lead to an NDA submission or filing acceptance. Our failure to successfully develop and achieve final FDA approval of our product candidates in development will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf the FDA disagrees with our determination that certain of our products meet the over-the-counter, or OTC, Monograph requirements, once those products are commercialized, they may be removed from the market; the FDA or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, may object to our advertisement and promotion of the extraction characteristics and benefits of our Nexafed products.\nDrugs that have been deemed safe and effective by the FDA for use by the general public without a prescription are classified as OTC drug products. Certain OTC drug products may be commercialized without premarket review by the FDA if the standards set forth in the applicable regulatory monograph are met. An OTC monograph provides the marketing conditions for the applicable OTC drug product, including active ingredients, labeling, and other general requirements, such as compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP and establishment registration. Any product which fails to conform to each of the general conditions in a monograph is subject to regulatory action. Further, although the FDA regulates OTC drug product labeling, the FTC regulates the advertising and marketing of OTC drug products. We believe that our Nexafed products licensed to MainPointe are classified for OTC sale under an FDA OTC monograph, which will allow for their commercialization without submitting an NDA or abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA to the FDA. We have also determined that, provided MainPointe adheres to the FDA\u2019s requirements for OTC monograph products, including product labeling, we can advertise and promote the extraction characteristics and benefits of our Nexafed products which are supported by our research studies. No assurance can be given, however, that the FDA will agree that our Nexafed products may be sold under the FDA\u2019s OTC monograph product regulations or that the FDA or FTC will not object to MainPointe\u2019s advertisement and promotion of our Nexafed products\u2019 extraction characteristics and benefits. If the FDA determines that our Nexafed products do not conform to the OTC monograph or if MainPointe fails to meet the general conditions, once commercialized, the products may be removed from the market and we and MainPointe may face various actions including, but not limited to, restrictions on the marketing or distribution of such products, warning letters, fines, product seizure, or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Any of these actions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. Additionally, the FDA has announced that it is considering material changes to how it regulates OTC drug products and held a hearing in late March 2014 for public comment. Changes to the existing OTC regulations could result in a requirement that an NDA or ANDA be filed for our Nexafed products or other Impede Technology products in order to commercialize such products. If the FDA requires the submission of a NDA or ANDA to obtain marketing approval for our Nexafed\u00ae products or other Impede Technology products, this would result in substantial additional costs, suspend the commercialization of our Nexafed products and require FDA approval prior to sale, of which no assurance can be provided. In such case, the label for our Nexafed products or other Impede Technology products would be subject to FDA review and approval and there can be no assurance that we or our licensees will be able to market Nexafed or other Impede Technology products with labeling sufficient to differentiate it from products that have comparable therapeutic profiles. If we or our licensees are unable to advertise and promote the extraction characteristics of Nexafed or other Impede Technology products, we or our licensees may be unable to compete with national brands and pharmacy chain store brands.\nOur LIMITx, Impede and Aversion Technology products may not be successful in limiting or impeding abuse or misuse or provide additional safety upon commercialization.\nWe are committing a majority of our resources to the development of products utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies. Notwithstanding the receipt of FDA approval of Oxaydo and the results of our numerous clinical and laboratory studies for Oxaydo, our Nexafed products, and our LIMITx and Impede Technology products in development, there can be no assurance that Oxaydo, our Nexafed products or any other product utilizing our LIMITx, Impede or Aversion Technologies will perform as tested and limit or impede the actual abuse or misuse of such products or provide other benefits in commercial settings. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the post-approval epidemiological study required by the FDA as a condition of approval of Oxaydo will show a reduction in the consequences of abuse and misuse by patients for whom Oxaydo is prescribed. To date, Zyla has not achieved sufficient market share for Oxaydo to support a full epidemiological study. The failure of Oxaydo, our Nexafed products or other products utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies to limit or impede actual abuse or misuse or provide other safety benefits in practice will have a material adverse impact on market acceptance for such products and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRelying on third party contract research organizations, or CROs may result in delays in our pre-clinical, clinical or laboratory testing. If pre-clinical, clinical or laboratory testing for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.\nTo obtain FDA approval to commercially sell and distribute in the United States any of our prescription product candidates, we or our licensees must submit to the FDA a NDA demonstrating, among other things, that the product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. As we do not possess the resources or employ all the personnel necessary to conduct such testing, we rely on CROs for the majority of this testing with our product candidates. As a result, we have less control over our development program than if we performed the testing entirely on our own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities on our anticipated schedule. Delays in our development programs could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.\nThe commencement of clinical trials with our product candidates may be delayed for several reasons, including, but not limited to, delays in demonstrating sufficient pre-clinical safety required to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial, reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites and licensees, manufacturing and quality assurance release of a sufficient supply of a product candidate for use in our clinical trials and/or obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical site. Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or regulatory authorities due to several factors, including ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, a determination by us or regulatory authorities that continuing a trial presents an unreasonable health risk to participants, failure to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements, lower than anticipated recruitment or retention rate of patients in clinical trials, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by regulatory authorities, the imposition of a clinical hold by FDA, lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials, and/or negative or unanticipated results of clinical trials.\nClinical trials required by the FDA for commercial approval may not demonstrate safety or efficacy of our product candidates. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not assure that later clinical trials will be successful. Results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. Even if the results of our or our licensee\u2019s pivotal phase III clinical trials are positive, we and our licensees may have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conduct further pre-clinical and clinical studies before we or our licensees can submit NDAs or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nClinical trials are expensive and at times, difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Further, if participating subjects or patients in clinical studies suffer drug-related adverse reactions during the course of such trials, or if we, our licensees or the FDA believes that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, we or our licensees may suspend the clinical trials. Failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we or our licensees could encounter problems causing the abandonment of clinical trials or the need to conduct additional clinical studies, relating to a product candidate.\nEven if our clinical trials and laboratory testing are completed as planned, their results may not support commercially viable product label claims. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for their intended use. Such failure may cause us or our licensees to abandon a product candidate and may delay the development of other product candidates.\nWe have no commercial manufacturing capacity and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our products.\nWe do not have the facilities, equipment or personnel to manufacture commercial quantities of our products and therefore must rely on our licensees or other qualified third-party contract manufactures with appropriate facilities and equipment to contract manufacture commercial quantities of products utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies. These licensees and third- party contract manufacturers are also subject to cGMP regulations, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. Any performance failure on the part of our licensees or contract manufacturers could delay commercialization of any approved products, depriving us of potential product revenue.\nOur drug products, including our licensed Nexafed products, require precise, high quality manufacturing. Failure by our contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could materially adversely affect our business. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control, and quality assurance. These manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations; however, beyond contractual remedies that may be available to us, we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\nIf for some reason our contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, or if we are unable to reach agreement with our contract manufacturers on the terms of continued supply of our products, we may be required to replace them. Although we believe there are a number of potential replacements, we will incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products or drug candidates, which could adversely impact the continued supply of our products or drug candidates.\nWe or our licensees may not obtain required FDA approval; the FDA approval process is time-consuming and expensive.\nThe development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation in the United States and other countries. Satisfaction of all regulatory requirements typically takes years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research, development and testing. Substantially all of our operations are subject to compliance with FDA regulations. Failure to adhere to applicable FDA regulations by us or our licensees would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In addition, in the event we are successful in developing product candidates for distribution and sale in other countries, we would become subject to regulation in such countries. Such foreign regulations and product approval requirements are expected to be time consuming and expensive. In addition, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance and review and approval of marketing applications. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe or our licensees may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory review and approval process based upon the failure of clinical or laboratory data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product candidates to meet, the FDA\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality; and those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations. After submission of a NDA, the FDA may refuse to file the application, deny approval of the application, require additional testing or data and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. For instance, the FDA\u2019s approval of Oxaydo is conditioned on us or Zyla conducting a post-approval epidemiological study to assess the actual abuse levels and consequences of Oxaydo in the market. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, sets time standards for the FDA\u2019s review of NDAs. The FDA's timelines described in the PDUFA guidance are flexible and subject to change based on workload and other potential review issues and may delay the FDA\u2019s review of an NDA. Further, the terms of approval of any NDA, including the product labeling, may be more restrictive than we or our licensees desire and could affect the marketability of our products.\nEven if we comply with all the FDA regulatory requirements, we or our licensees may not obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in development. For example, we previously submitted a NDA to the FDA for an Aversion Technology product containing niacin, intended to provide impediments to over-ingesting the product. Such niacin containing product was not approved by the FDA. If we or our licensees fail to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in development, we will have fewer commercialized products and correspondingly lower revenues.\nEven if regulatory approval of our products in development is received, such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or promotional claims we or our licensees may make for our products, or otherwise not permit labeling that sufficiently differentiates our product candidates from competitive products with comparable therapeutic profiles but without abuse deterrent features (see risk factor above entitled \u201cOur and our licensees ability to market and promote Oxaydo and LIMITx Technology products by describing the abuse deterrent features of such products will be determined by the FDA approved label for such products\u201d). Such events would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We may market certain of our products without the prior application to and approval by the FDA. The FDA may subsequently require us to withdraw such products and submit NDA\u2019s for approval prior to re-marketing.\nThe FDA also has the authority to revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products for cause, to debar companies and individuals from participating in the drug-approval process, to request recalls of allegedly violative products, to seize allegedly violative products, to obtain injunctions to close manufacturing plants allegedly not operating in conformity with current cGMP and to stop shipments of allegedly violative products. In the event the FDA takes any such action relating to our products, such actions would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe must maintain FDA approval to manufacture clinical supplies of our product candidates at our facility; failure to maintain compliance with FDA requirements may prevent or delay the manufacture of our product candidates and costs of manufacture may be higher than expected.\nWe have installed the equipment necessary to manufacture clinical trial supplies of our LIMITx and Impede Technology product candidates in tablet formulations at our Culver, Indiana facility. To be used in clinical trials, all of our product candidates must be manufactured in conformity with cGMP regulations. All such product candidates must be manufactured, packaged, and labeled and stored in accordance with cGMPs. Modifications, enhancements or changes in manufacturing sites of marketed products are, in many circumstances, subject to FDA approval, which may be subject to a lengthy application process or which we may be unable to obtain. Our Culver, Indiana facility, and those of any third-party manufacturers that we or our licensees may use, are periodically subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental agencies, and operations at these facilities could be interrupted or halted if the FDA deems such inspections are unsatisfactory. Failure to comply with FDA or other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, suspension of FDA review of our product candidates, termination of ongoing research, disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nWe develop our products, and manufacture clinical supplies, at a single location. Any disruption at this facility could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our Culver, Indiana facility for developing our product candidates and the manufacture of clinical supplies of our product candidates. If the Culver, Indiana facility were damaged or destroyed, or otherwise subject to disruption, it would require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. If our Culver facility were affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely entirely on CROs and third-party contract manufacturers for an indefinite period of time. Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and for the disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, any disruptions or delays at our Culver, Indiana facility could impair our ability to develop our product candidates utilizing the Impede or LIMITx Technologies, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations, with which compliance is costly and which exposes us to penalties for non-compliance.\nOur business, properties and product candidates are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety and the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, waste and other regulated materials. Because we own and operate real property, various environmental laws also may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property, including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we dispose of or recycle hazardous substances. The costs of complying with these various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully establish new license agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our other products in development may adversely impair our ability to develop, market and sell such products.\nThe AD Pharma Agreement grants AD Pharma an exclusive license to develop and commercialize LTX-03 in the US. The Zyla Agreement grants Zyla an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize Oxaydo. Our license agreement with KemPharm Inc., or the KemPharm Agreement, grants exclusive worldwide rights to KemPharm to utilize our Aversion technology in certain of KemPharm\u2019s prodrug products. Our license agreement with MainPointe grants exclusive rights in the U.S. and Canada (with option rights to expand the licensed territory) to our Nexafed products with option rights to certain other pseudoephedrine-containing products utilizing our Impede technology. We believe that opportunities exist to enter into license agreements similar to the AD Pharma Agreement, Zyla Agreement, the KemPharm Agreement and the MainPointe Agreement with other pharmaceutical company partners for the development and commercialization of our LIMITx, Impede and Aversion Technologies in the United States and worldwide. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such license agreements in the future. If we are unable to enter into such agreements, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, and our financial condition and results of operations, would be materially adversely affected.\nIf our licensees do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our licensed product candidates.\nAs part of the AD Pharma Agreement, the Zyla Agreement, the KemPharm Agreement, the MainPointe Agreement, or any license agreement we may enter into relating to any of our LIMITx or Impede Technology products in development or our Aversion Technology, we do not have day-to-day control over the activities of our licensees with respect to any product candidate. If a licensee fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development and/or commercialization of the product covered by that agreement or to enter into alternative arrangements with another third party. In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the products that are the subject of a license agreement. Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the products covered by such agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our licensees. We could be involved in disputes with a licensee, which could lead to delays in or termination of, our development and/or commercialization programs and result in time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. In addition, any such dispute could diminish our licensee\u2019s commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and/or commercializing our products. If any licensee terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing and/or commercializing our product candidates would be materially adversely effected. Additionally, due to the nature of the market for Oxaydo and our LIMITx and Impede product candidates, it may be necessary for us to license a significant portion of our product candidates to a single company, thereby eliminating our opportunity to commercialize other product candidates with other licensees.\nIf we fail to maintain our license agreement with Zyla, we may have to commercialize Oxaydo on our own and if we fail to maintain the license agreement with AD Pharma we may have to commercialize Nexafed Products on our own.\nOur plan for manufacturing and commercializing Oxaydo currently requires us to maintain our license agreement with Zyla. In addition to other customary termination provisions, the Zyla Agreement provides that Zyla may terminate the Zyla Agreement upon certain notice periods. If Zyla elects to terminate the Zyla Agreement, or if we are otherwise unable to maintain our existing relationship with Zyla, we would have to commercialize Oxaydo ourselves for which we currently have no infrastructure, or alternatively enter into a new agreement with another pharmaceutical company, of which no assurance can be given. Our ability to commercialize Oxaydo on our own may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. While, there is no provision for MainPointe to elect to terminate its license agreement without cause, if it should fail to perform thereunder and we terminated the agreement, then we would have to commercialize the Nexafed Products on our own. Although prior to entering into the MainPointe agreement we had been commercializing certain Nexafed Products on our own, we would have to reestablish our capabilities, which will require additional financing which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe market may not be receptive to products incorporating our Aversion, Impede or LIMITx Technologies.\nThe commercial success of our products will depend on acceptance by health care providers and others that such products are clinically useful, cost-effective and safe. There can be no assurance given that our products utilizing the Aversion, Impede or LIMITx Technologies will be accepted by health care providers and others. Factors that may materially affect market acceptance of our product candidates include but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 the relative advantages and disadvantages of our products compared to competitive products;\n\u00b7 the relative timing to commercial launch of our products compared to competitive products;\n\u00b7 the relative safety and efficacy of our products compared to competitive products;\n\u00b7 the product labeling approved by the FDA for our products;\n\u00b7 the perception of health care providers of their role in helping to prevent abuse and their willingness to prescribe abuse-deterrent products to do so;\n\u00b7 the willingness of third party payers to reimburse for our prescription products;\n\u00b7 the willingness of pharmacy chains to stock our products;\n\u00b7 the willingness of pharmacists to recommend our Nexafed products to their customers; and\n\u00b7 the willingness of consumers to pay for our products.\nOxaydo and our Nexafed Products compete, and our other product candidates, such as LTX-03, if successfully developed and commercially launched will compete, with both currently marketed and new products launched in the future by other companies. Physicians and other prescribers may not be inclined to prescribe our prescription products unless our products demonstrate commercially viable advantages over other products currently marketed for the same indications. Pharmacy chains may not be willing to stock any of our products and pharmacists may not recommend Nexafed products to consumers. Further, consumers may not be willing to purchase our products. If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.\nIf we, our licensees or others identify serious adverse events or deaths relating to any of our products once on the market, we may be required to withdraw our products from the market, which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.\nWe or our licensees are required to report to relevant regulatory authorities all serious adverse events or deaths involving our product candidates or approved products. If we, our licensees, or others identify such events, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such products; we or our licensees may be required to reformulate our products; we or our licensees may have to recall the affected products from the market and may not be able to reintroduce them onto the market; our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and we may become the target of lawsuits, including class actions suits. Any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products and could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain insurance coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers.\nThe ability of our licensees to successfully commercialize our products may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our prescription products from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers and administrators, including Medicaid and Medicare. We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for newly-approved products utilizing our Aversion, Impede or LIMITx Technologies. Third-party payers and administrators, including state Medicaid programs and Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products. Government and other third-party payers increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our product candidates. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity. If government and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any product utilizing our technologies, health care providers may not prescribe them or patients may ask their health care providers to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement. In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical products are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect there may be federal and state proposals for similar controls. In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or our licensees charge for any of our products in the future. Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability or the ability of our licensees to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from commercialization\nFederal and foreign legislation may be enacted that may seriously impact the commercial viability and acceptance of the products we have licensed and are developing.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our or our licensees\u2019 ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, was enacted. The Healthcare Reform Law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u00b7 An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u00b7 An increase in the minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u00b7 A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, under which manufacturers must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u00b7 Extension of a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7 A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;\n\u00b7 A revision to the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes; and\n\u00b7 Encouragement for the development of comparative effectiveness research, which may reduce the extent of reimbursement for our products if such research results in any adverse findings.\nAt this time, it remains uncertain what the full impact of these provisions will be on the pharmaceutical industry generally or our business in particular. The full effects of these provisions will become apparent as these laws are implemented and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance as required by the Healthcare Reform Law. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products.\nIn addition, since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Law, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Healthcare Reform Law. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or for the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly, numerous initiatives and reforms by legislatures, regulators and third-party payers to curb these cost increases have resulted in a trend in the healthcare industry to consolidate product suppliers and purchasers. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition among suppliers to provide products to purchasers has become more intense. This in turn has resulted, and will likely continue to result, in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, and large single accounts continue to use their market power to influence product pricing and purchasing decisions. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to influence the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our anticipated products. This downward pricing pressure may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Under each of the Zyla Agreement, the KemPharm Agreement, the MainPointe Agreement and AD Pharma Agreement, our licensees control (or will control in the case of AD Pharma for LTLX-03) the price of the licensed products, and we expect that our licensees, if any, of our products in development, will control the price of such products and may provide price discounts and price reductions in its discretion. Such price discounts and reductions will reduce the net sales of our licensed products and, correspondingly, our royalty payments under such license agreements. In addition, if any of our large customers is acquired or merged with another provider of similar products, we may lose that customer\u2019s business\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for products developed utilizing our technologies, in the United States and in other countries, and to enforce these patents. The patent positions of pharmaceutical firms, including us, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Notwithstanding our receipt of U.S. patents covering our Aversion, Impede and LIMITx Technologies, there is no assurance that any of our patent claims in our other pending non-provisional and provisional patent applications relating to our technologies will issue or if issued, that any of our existing and future patent claims will be held valid and enforceable against third-party infringement or that our products will not infringe any third-party patent or intellectual property. Moreover, any patent claims relating to our technologies may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products. In addition, issued patent claims may be challenged, potentially invalidated or potentially circumvented. Our patent claims may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology or permit the commercialization of our products without infringing third-party patents or other intellectual property rights.\nOur success also depends on our not infringing patents issued to others. We may become aware of patents belonging to competitors and others that could require us to obtain licenses to such patents or alter our technologies. Obtaining such licenses or altering our technology could be time consuming and costly. We may not be able to obtain a license to any technology owned by or licensed to a third party that we or our licensees require to manufacture or market one or more of our products. Even if we can obtain a license, the financial and other terms may be disadvantageous.\nOur success also depends on maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how. We seek to protect such information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, potential licensees, raw material suppliers, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants and other parties. These agreements may be breached by such parties. We may not be able to obtain an adequate, or perhaps any, remedy to such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Our inability to protect our intellectual property or to commercialize our products without infringing third-party patents or other intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe also rely on or intend to rely on our or our licensees\u2019 trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. However, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may also oppose our or our licensees\u2019 trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our or our licensees\u2019 trademarks are successfully challenged, we or our licensees could be forced to rebrand our product, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us or our licensees to devote resources to advertising and marketing these new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks, or we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our Aversion, Impede or LIMITx Technologies or product candidates, which could result in liability for damages or delay or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights. The situations in which we may become parties to such litigation or proceedings may include:\n\u00b7 litigation or other proceedings we or our licensee(s) may initiate against third parties to enforce our patent rights or other intellectual property rights, including the Paragraph IV Proceedings described below in the next risk factor;\n\u00b7 litigation or other proceedings we or our licensee(s) may initiate against third parties seeking to invalidate the patents held by such third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products do not infringe such third parties\u2019 patents;\n\u00b7 litigation or other proceedings third parties may initiate against us or our licensee(s) to seek to invalidate our patents or to obtain a judgment that third party products do not infringe our patents;\n\u00b7 if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us, we may be forced to participate in interference, inter partes or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention and whether we are entitled to patent rights on such invention; and\n\u00b7 if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we will need to defend against such proceedings.\nThe costs of resolving any patent litigation, including the Paragraph IV Proceedings, or other intellectual property proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Many of our potential competitors will be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation, including the Paragraph IV Proceedings, and other intellectual property proceedings may also consume significant management time.\nIn the event that a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patent or other intellectual property rights against a challenge. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and protecting our products, it would harm our business. In certain circumstances, we expect that our licensees will have first right to control the enforcement of certain of our patents against third party infringers. Our licensees may not put adequate resources or effort into such enforcement actions or otherwise fail to restrain infringing products. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, including the Paragraph IV Proceedings, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation, including the Paragraph IV Proceedings, or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nOur technologies or products may be found to infringe claims of patents owned by others. If we determine that we are, or if we are found to be infringing a patent held by another party, we, our suppliers or our licensees might have to seek a license to make, use, and sell the patented technologies and products. In that case, we, our suppliers or our licensees might not be able to obtain such license on acceptable terms, or at all. The failure to obtain a license to any third party technology that we may require would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a legal action is brought against us or our licensees, we could incur substantial defense costs, and any such action might not be resolved in our favor. If such a dispute is resolved against us, we may have to pay the other party large sums of money and use of our technology and the testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale of one or more of our products could be restricted or prohibited. Even prior to resolution of such a dispute, use of our technology and the testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale of one or more of our products could be restricted or prohibited.\nWe are aware of certain United States and international pending patent applications owned by third parties with claims potentially encompassing Oxaydo and our other products. If such patent applications result in valid and enforceable issued patents, containing claims in their current form or otherwise encompassing our products we or our licensees may be required to obtain a license to such patents, should one be available, or alternatively, alter our products so as to avoid infringing such third-party patents. If we or our licensees are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we or our licensees could be restricted or prevented from commercializing our products. Additionally, any alterations to our products or our technologies could be time consuming and costly and may not result in technologies or products that are non-infringing or commercially viable.\nWe are aware of an issued United States patent owned by a third party having claims encompassing the use of one of our Aversion inactive ingredients. We are also aware of an issued United States patent owned by a third party having claims encompassing a pharmaceutical preparation containing viscosity producing ingredients that can be drawn into a syringe when dissolved in 10mL\u2019s or less of aqueous solution. While we believe that our Aversion products do not infringe these patents, or that such patents are otherwise invalid, there can be no assurance that we or our licensees will not be sued for infringing these patents, and if sued, there can be no assurance that we or our licensees will prevail in any such litigation. If we or our licensees are found to infringe either or both of these patents, we or our licensees may seek a license to use the patented technology. If we are unable to obtain such a license, of which no assurance can be given, we or our licensees may be restricted or prevented from commercializing our Aversion products.\nWe are aware of certain issued United States patents owned by a third party having claims encompassing a process used to manufacture oxycodone HCl of high purity and pharmaceutical products resulting therefrom. As required by the FDA, Oxaydo contains a similar high purity oxycodone HCl manufactured by a supplier that is not the owner or licensee of such patents. The owner of these patents has filed patent infringement actions relating to these patents against companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA for extended-release versions of oxycodone HCl. To our knowledge, the patent owner has not initiated any patent infringement actions against the sellers of immediate-release oxycodone HCl products or their suppliers of oxycodone HCl, however, we cannot be certain that these immediate-release products actually utilize a high purity oxycodone. We cannot provide assurance that our licensee or its oxycodone HCl supplier will not be sued for infringing these patents. In the event of an infringement action, our licensee and their oxycodone HCl supplier would have to either: (a) demonstrate that the manufacture of the oxycodone HCl used in Oxaydo does not infringe the patent claims, (b) demonstrate the patents are invalid or unenforceable, or (c) enter into a license with the patent owner. If our licensee or their oxycodone HCl supplier is unable to demonstrate the foregoing, or obtain a license to these patients, our licensee may be required or choose to withdraw Oxaydo from the market.\nWe are aware of a certain issued United States patent owned by a third party having claims similar to our second generation Impede Technology directed to ingredient amounts that are generally more than the amounts used in our technology. While we believe our technology does not infringe this patent, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be sued under such patent or if sued, that we will prevail in any such suit.\nWe cannot assure you that our technologies, products and/or actions in developing our products will not infringe third-party patents. Our failure to avoid infringing third-party patents and intellectual property rights in the development and commercialization of our products would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nGeneric manufacturers are using litigation and regulatory means to seek approval for generic versions of Oxaydo, which could cause Zyla\u2019s sales to suffer and adversely impact our royalty revenue.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) for a generic version of a branded drug and what is referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for a branded variation of an existing branded drug, without requiring such applicant to undertake the full clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In November 2017 the FDA issued guidance for the industry on obtaining approval for generic versions of opioids that reference products whose labeling describes abuse-deterrent properties. An ANDA applicant usually needs to only submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s) and is bioequivalent to the branded product, in addition to any data necessary to establish that any difference in strength, dosage form, inactive ingredients, or delivery mechanism does not result in different safety or efficacy profiles, as compared to the reference drug. Under the 2017 FDA guidance when a potential ANDA applicant develops a generic solid oral opioid drug product, the potential ANDA applicant should evaluate its proposed generic drug to show that it is no less abuse deterrent than the reference drug with respect to all of the potential routes of abuse.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act requires an applicant for a drug that references one of our branded drugs to notify us of their application if they assert in their application that the patents we have listed in the Orange Book will not be infringed or otherwise are invalid or unenforceable (a Paragraph IV Certification). Upon receipt of this notice, we or our licensee will have 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit known as a Paragraph IV Proceeding in federal district court against such applicant. If such a suit is commenced, the FDA is generally prohibited from granting approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months from the date the FDA accepted the application for filing, the conclusion of litigation in the generic applicant\u2019s favor or expiration of the patent(s). If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the standards for approval of ANDAs and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs. Frequently, the unpredictable nature and significant costs of patent litigation leads the parties to settle to remove this uncertainty. Settlement agreements between branded companies and generic applicants may allow, among other things, a generic product to enter the market prior to the expiration of any or all of the applicable patents covering the branded product, either through the introduction of an authorized generic or by providing a license to the applicant for the patents subject to the litigation.\nIn 2012 and 2013, we received Paragraph IV Certification Notices under 21 U.S.C. 355(j) (a Paragraph IV Notice) from 5 different generic sponsors of an ANDA for a generic drug listing Oxaydo as the reference listed drug. We initiated patent infringement proceedings against all 5. In 2013 and 2014, Watson Laboratories, Inc. - Florida (Watson) withdrew their Paragraph IV certification and we settled our litigation with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc. Sandoz Inc., and Ranbaxy, Inc. Par is the first filer of an ANDA for a generic Oxaydo product and is entitled to the 180-day first filer exclusivity under applicable law and FDA regulations.\nUnder the terms of the Settlement Agreement with Par, Par may launch its generic Oxaydo product in the U.S., through the grant of a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license from us that would trigger on January 1, 2022.\nIt is possible that other generic manufacturers may also seek to launch a generic version of Oxaydo and challenge our patents. Any determination in any such infringement actions that our patents covering our Aversion Technology and Oxaydo are invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or that the products covered by generic sponsors\u2019 ANDAs do not infringe our patents could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims and claims regarding marketing of products and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance and some claims may not be covered by insurance.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products, and in particular opioid products. Manufacturers and distributors of prescription opioid medications, are the subject of lawsuits and have received subpoenas and other requests for information from various state and local government agencies regarding the sales and marketing of opioid medications. While we would not expect to be implicated in any such action or investigations, since our business is focused on abuse deterrence, there can be no assurance that we will not be so implicated. Product liability claims or marketing related claims might be made by patients, health care providers or others that sell or consume our products or insurance companies that insure those affected by our products. These claims may be made even with respect to those products that possess regulatory approval for commercial sale. We currently have clinical trial product liability insurance on a claims-made basis for our subject clinical trials and have product liability insurance for the Nexafed and Oxaydo products. This coverage may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims. Product liability coverage and other insurance is expensive. In the future, we may not be able to maintain such product liability insurance or other insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability claims or other claims. In addition our insurance may not cover certain marketing related claims and excludes certain products from product liability coverage. See litigation discussed below under \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Report. Any claims that are not covered by product liability insurance or other insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by frequent litigation. Those companies with significant financial resources will be better able to bring and defend any such litigation. No assurance can be given that we would not become involved in future litigation, in addition to the ongoing Reglan/Metoclopramide mass tort litigation and DES (diethylstilbestrol) litigation discussed below under \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Report, including litigation relating to products we manufactured or distributed several years and decades ago when we manufactured and sold a broad range of prescription and over the counter products. Such litigation may have material adverse consequences to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nOur products and technologies compete to varying degrees against both brand and generic products offering similar therapeutic benefits and being developed and marketed by small and large pharmaceutical (for prescription products) and consumer packaged goods (for OTC products) companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources and are able to expend more funds and effort than us and our licensees in research, development and commercialization of their competitive technologies and products. Prescription generic products and OTC store brand products will offer cost savings to third party payers and/or consumers that will create pricing pressure on our products. Also, these competitors may have a substantial sales volume advantage over our products, which may result in our licensee\u2019s costs of manufacturing being higher than our competitors\u2019 costs. If our products are unable to capture and maintain market share, we or our licensees may not achieve significant product revenues and our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe believe potential competitors may be developing opioid abuse deterrent technologies and products. Such potential competitors include, but may not be limited to, Pfizer Inc., Purdue Pharma, Atlantic Pharmaceuticals, KemPharm, Shionogi, Nektar Therapeutics, Signature Therapeutics, QRx Pharma, Tris Pharma, Pisgah Labs, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Inspirion Delivery Sciences, and Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These companies appear to be focusing their development efforts on ER Opioid Products, except for Atlantic Pharmaceuticals, Pisgah Labs, Inspirion and KemPharm.\nOur Impede Technology products containing PSE, including our licensed Nexafed products, will compete in the highly competitive market for cold, sinus and allergy products generally available to the consumer without a prescription. Some of our competitors will have multiple consumer product offerings both within and outside the cold, allergy and sinus category providing them with substantial leverage in dealing with a highly consolidated pharmacy distribution network. The competing products may have well established brand names and may be supported by national or regional advertising. Our Nexafed products compete directly with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Sudafed\u00ae brand as well as generic formulations manufactured by Perrigo Company and others.\nWe are concentrating a substantial majority of our efforts and resources on developing product candidates utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies. The commercial success of products utilizing such technologies will depend, in large part, on the intensity of competition, FDA approved product labeling for our products compared to competitive products, and the relative timing and sequence for commercial launch of new products by other companies developing, marketing, selling and distributing products that compete with the products utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies. Alternative technologies and non-opioid products are being developed to improve or replace the use of opioid analgesics. In the event that such alternatives to opioid analgesics are widely adopted, then the market for products utilizing our LIMITx and Impede Technologies may be substantially decreased, thus reducing our ability to generate future revenues and adversely affecting our ability to generate a profit\nKey personnel are critical to our business and our success depends on our ability to retain them.\nWe are dependent on our management and scientific team, including Robert Jones, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter A. Clemens, our Chief Financial Officer, and Albert W. Brzeczko, Ph.D., our Vice President of Pharmaceutical Sciences. We may not be able to retain the services of key personnel or attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. While we have employment agreements with our CEO and CFO, all of our other employees are at-will employees who may terminate their employment at any time. We do not have key personnel insurance on any of our officers or employees. The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain such personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product and technology development and business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and such regulation may affect the development and sale of our products.\nThe DEA regulates certain finished drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including certain opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients and pseudoephedrine HCl that are contained in our products. Consequently, their manufacture, research, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Furthermore, the amount of active ingredients we can obtain for our clinical trials is limited by the DEA and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials. There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the supply of the products used in our clinical trials.\nIn addition, we and our licensees and contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing DEA regulatory obligations, including, among other things, annual registration renewal, security, recordkeeping, theft and loss reporting, periodic inspection and annual quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our products. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Facilities that conduct research, manufacture, store, distribute, import or export controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.\nIndividual states also have controlled substances laws. Though state controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there has to be a rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain FDA approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the attractiveness of such product. We or our licensees must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nFurther, many of our raw ingredients and manufacturing equipment comes from international sources. Trade agreements and/or disagreements or other unforeseen disruptions to international supply chains may have an adverse impact on our business.\nSocial issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioid and regulatory efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for Oxaydo, and, if approved, our LIMITx product candidates.\nMedia stories regarding prescription drug abuse and the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids. Such efforts may inhibit Zyla\u2019s ability to commercialize Oxaydo and, if approved, our LIMITx product candidate. Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other opioid drugs, the limitations of abuse resistant formulations, public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse, litigation or regulatory activity, sales, marketing, distribution or storage of our drug products could harm our reputation. Such negative publicity could reduce the potential size of the market for our product candidates and Oxaydo and decrease the revenues and royalties we are able to generate from their sale. Similarly, to the extent opioid abuse becomes less prevalent or a less urgent public health issue, regulators and third-party payers may not be willing to pay a premium for abuse deterrent formulations of opioids.\nIn addition, efforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat abuse of opioids may negatively impact the market for our product candidates. For example, in February 2016, as part of a broader initiative led by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA\u2019s approach to opioid medications. The plan identifies the FDA\u2019s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA\u2019s plan include strengthening post marketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA\u2019s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. Many of these changes could require our licensing partner and us to expend additional resources in developing and commercializing Oxaydo and our product candidates to meet additional requirements. In October 2017, the acting director of HHS under the directive of President Trump, declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency and initiated a five point plan including (i) improving access to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; (ii) targeting the availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs; (iii) strengthening public health data reporting and collection; (iv) supporting cutting-edge research on addiction and pain; and (v) advancing the practice of pain management. The impact that this five point plan will have on us and our licensing partners is unclear at this time.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data storage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner in order to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners, vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Maintaining the secrecy of this confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information is important to our competitive business position. While we have taken steps to protect such information and invested in information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful access or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or misuse of critical or sensitive information. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nPrior ownership changes may limit our ability to use our tax net operating loss carryforwards as part of an corporate restructure or reorganization.\nSignificant equity restructuring often results in an Internal Revenue Section 382 ownership change that limits the future use of Net Operating Loss (\u201cNOL\u201d), carryforwards and other tax attributes. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, NOL usage in any given year will be limited to 80% of taxable income, without regard to the NOL deduction, and losses incurred in 2018 and forward may not be carried back but can be carried forward indefinitely, but losses incurred prior to 2018 can only be carried forward for 20 years. We have determined that we have undergone ownership changes in both 2004 and 2017 (as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) and as a result, our use of NOL carryforwards on an annual basis will be very limited. As such, an entity that may seek to acquire the Company would likely be limited in the amount of NOLs they may be able to utilize. Neither the amount of our NOL carryforwards nor the amount of limitation of such carryforwards claimed by us have been audited or otherwise validated by the Internal Revenue Service, which could challenge the amount we have calculated. The recognition and measurement of our tax benefit includes estimates and judgment by our management, which includes subjectivity. Changes in estimates may create volatility in our tax rate in future periods based on new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur results of operations will fluctuate, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of any license agreement, the timing of launch and market acceptance of our products, and the timing of the research, development and regulatory submissions of our products in development that could cause our operating results to fluctuate. The forecasting of the timing and amount of sales of our products is difficult due to market uncertainty and the uncertainty inherent in seeking FDA and other necessary approvals for our product candidates. As a result, in some periods, our clinical, financial or operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nDuring 2019, our stock traded as high as $0.63 per share and as low as $0.11 per share. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to exhibit wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors could include:\n\u00b7 results from our pre-clinical and clinical development programs, including our LIMITx product candidates;\n\u00b7 FDA actions related to our products in development;\n\u00b7 FDA actions related to any of our potential products;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding the sales of Oxaydo;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding the progress of our preclinical and clinical programs;\n\u00b7 our licensee\u2019s success in the commercialization of our Nexafed products;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding the sales of our Nexafed products;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding the execution of license agreements with third parties for our products or product candidates;\n\u00b7 failure of any of our products in development, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, regulatory approvals, clinical milestones, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 third-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u00b7 the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate commercial supplies of our products;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 any major change in our board or management;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our market; and\n\u00b7 political instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals or milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. Also, from time to time, we expect that we will publicly announce the anticipated timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline and the commercialization of our products and potential products may be delayed.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe do not have a history of paying dividends on our common stock.\nHistorically, we have not declared and paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nAny future sale of a substantial number of shares in a capital raising transaction could depress the trading price of our stock.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the then current trading price of our common stock. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the then current trading price of our common stock.\nAs of February 15, 2020, our two largest shareholders own an aggregate of 12,651,582 shares (including 1,782,531 shares underlying warrants) (representing approximately 54.6% of our outstanding shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants but not including any other warrants, options or convertible debt outstanding to other entities). If some or all of such shares are sold by such stockholders, it may have the effect of depressing the trading price of our common stock. In addition, such sales could make it more difficult for us to raise capital if needed in the future.\nApproximately 45.6% of our common stock, after giving effect to exercise of a warrant, is owned by a single individual, who is also a principal of AD Pharma LLC and MainPointe Pharmaceuticals LLC, and that individual is also party to our Second Amended and Restated Voting Agreement.\nA significant amount of our common stock is owned by a single individual, Mr. Schutte. On July 24, 2017, we completed a $4.0 million private placement with him for the sale of 8,912,655 shares and warrants to purchase 1,782,531 shares at an exercise price of $0.528 and expiring on July 24, 2022. Mr. Schutte is a principal of MainPointe. In March 2017, we granted MainPointe an exclusive license to our Impede Technology to commercialize our Nexafed\u00ae and Nexafed\u00ae Sinus Pressure + Pain Products in the United States and Canada. MainPointe also has options to expand the territory and products covered for additional sums. Further, as part of the closing of the Transaction, we, Galen Partners III, L.P., and Essex Woodlands Health Ventures V, L.P. (\u201cEssex\u201d) amended and restated the existing Voting Agreement between the parties to provide for Mr. Schutte to join as a party so that he can designate a director (he has not done so). During 2018 and through June 28, 2019, Mr. Schutte had lent us an aggregate of $6.0 million (including accrued interest) on a secured basis with a security interest in all of our assets, including our intellectual property.\nAt June 28, 2019, we entered into a Promissory Note with Mr. Schutte that consolidated existing promissory notes into a single Note with a principal amount of $6.0 million (after including accrued and unpaid interest through that date). To secure our performance of our obligations under the Note, we granted Mr. Schutte a security interest in all of our assets. Terms of the consolidated Note provide for a July 1, 2023 maturity date rather than the previous maturity date of January 2, 2020, interest at fixed rate of 7.5% per annum with all payments of principal and interest deferred to maturity. The Note is convertible into Acura common stock at $0.16 per share. As additional consideration, Mr. Schutte received a warrant to purchase 10 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a price of $0.01 per share.\nWith our consent, Mr. Schutte assigned and transferred to Abuse Deterrent Pharma, LLC (\u201cAD Pharma\u201d), effective June 28, 2019, all of his right, title and interest in this Note, its associated Security Agreement and the Warrant to purchase 10 million common shares of our stock. Mr. Schutte is an investor in AD Pharma.\nThe combination of Mr. Schutte\u2019s direct share ownership, control of one of our key licensing partners, the right to designate a director to oversee the long-term affairs of our company, his ownership interest in AD Pharma LLC and the security interest AD Pharma has in all of our assets gives him considerable influence over our business and affairs. As a result, Mr. Schutte, as a practical matter, is able to control all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the approval or rejection of mergers, sales or licenses of all or substantially all of our assets, or other business combination transactions. The interests of Mr. Schutte as a shareholder and creditor may not always coincide with the interests of our other shareholders and as such he may and cause the Company to take action to advance his interests to the detriment of our other shareholders. Accordingly, you may not be able to influence any action we take or consider taking, even if it requires a shareholder vote.\nOur common stock is deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would make it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years or that have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company (such as Acura) has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nOur shares of common stock have been thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or even at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Market. Our common stock experiences periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded.\u201d This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. In addition, certain institutions are prohibited or limited from trading in shares priced at less than specified levels, including the prices at which our shares currently trade. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days, weeks or months when trading activity in our shares is minimal, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained or not diminish.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset- backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million. \u201cSmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and in certain registration statements. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.", "PERMNO": 10116, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACUR"}
