{"cik": "794172", "company": "MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisks Affecting Growth and Profitability of our Business\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19)\noutbreak.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19,\nor other adverse public health developments, could have material and adverse effects on our business operations. Such adverse effects could include diversion or prioritization of health care resources away from the conduct of diagnostic testing, disruptions of or restrictions on the ability of laboratories to process our tests, and delays with respect to or difficulties in patients accessing our tests, including those resulting from an inability to travel as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from COVID-19.\nAs COVID-19\ncontinues to affect individuals and businesses around the globe, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u2022\ndecreased volume of testing and related sales of certain of our Diagnostics products as a result of disruptions to health care providers and limitations on the ability of providers to administer tests;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or restrictions on the ability of the Company\u2019s, our collaborators\u2019, or our suppliers\u2019 personnel to travel, and temporary closures of our facilities, or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the development of our products, the processing of our diagnostic tests, and/or the conduct of our clinical trials, because of illness of employees or their families, or requirements imposed on employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022\ndelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19\nglobally could adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chains. Parts of our direct and indirect supply chains are located overseas, including in China, and may accordingly be subject to disruption. Additionally, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19\nor any other epidemic harms our business or the economy in general either domestically or in any other region in which we do business. The extent to which COVID-19\naffects our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19,\nand the actions to contain COVID-19\nor treat its impact, among others, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To date, we are seeing that the outbreak has slowed our assay instrument placements and sales of related test kits as diagnostic testing sites have turned their attention to critical care testing. We are unable to predict when expected sales volume levels for our instruments and related test kits will return. Also, as a result of the pandemic, certain clinical trials related to our products which were underway or scheduled to begin have been temporarily placed on hold. Such delays will impact our timing for filing applications for product clearances with the FDA, as well as related timing of FDA clearances of such filings. Additionally, the pandemic could slow down our efforts to expand our product portfolio through acquisitions and distribution opportunities, impacting the speed with which we are able to bring additional products to market.\n- 11 -\nIf our essential employees who are unable to telework become ill or otherwise incapacitated, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nConsistent with rapidly changing federal, state and local governmental orders and recommendations, we have implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of our employees. Employees that are unable to telework continue to work at our facilities, and we have implemented appropriate safety measures, including social distancing, face covering mandates, temperature checking, and increased sanitation standards in an attempt to maintain the health and safety of our workforce. We are following guidance from the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) regarding suspension of nonessential travel, self-isolation recommendations for employees returning from certain geographic areas, confirmed reports of any COVID-19\ndiagnosis among our employees, and the return of such employees to our workplace. Pursuant to updated guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, we are engaging in limited and appropriate inquiries of employees regarding potential COVID-19\nexposure, based on the direct threat that such exposure may present to our workforce. We continue to address other unique situations that arise among our workforce due to the COVID-19\npandemic on a case-by-case\nbasis. While we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19\noutside of our workplace. If a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future epidemic, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to develop new products and services or acquire products and services on favorable terms.\nThe medical diagnostic and life science industries are characterized by ongoing technological developments and changing customer requirements. As such, our results of operations and continued growth depend, in part, on our ability in a timely manner to develop or acquire rights to, and successfully introduce into the marketplace, enhancements of existing products and services, or new products and services that incorporate technological advances, meet customer requirements and/or respond to products developed by our competition. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in developing or acquiring such rights to products and services on a timely basis, or that such products and services will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we must regularly allocate considerable resources to research and development of new or acquired products, services and technologies, and protecting intellectual property. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from research to product launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage, there is a risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a project in which we have invested substantial resources, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations or to achieve expected cost savings from acquisitions we make.\nOne of our growth strategies is the acquisition of companies and/or products. Although additional acquisitions of companies and products may enhance the opportunity to increase net earnings over time, such acquisitions could result in greater administrative burdens, increased exposure to the uncertainties inherent in marketing new products, financial risks of additional operating costs, disrupted operations, challenges in employee retention, and increased risk of asset impairments if future revenues and cash flows are deficient. The principal benefits expected to result from any acquisitions we make will not be achieved fully unless we are able to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired entities with our operations and realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating these businesses into our existing businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify and complete additional acquisitions on terms we consider favorable or that, if completed, will be successfully integrated into our operations. Furthermore, we cannot predict the outcome of goodwill impairment testing and the impact of goodwill impairments on the Company\u2019s earnings and financial results.\n- 12 -\nRevenues for our Diagnostics segment may be impacted by our reliance upon two key distributors in North America, seasonal factors and sporadic outbreaks, and changing diagnostic market conditions.\nKey Distributors\nOur Diagnostics segment\u2019s revenues from sales through two U.S. distributors were approximately 23% and 26% of the Diagnostics segment\u2019s total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, or approximately 12% and 18%, respectively, of each fiscal year\u2019s consolidated revenues. These parties distribute our products and other laboratory products to end-user\ncustomers. The loss of either of these distributors could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to one distributor were absorbed by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative on satisfactory terms may pose challenges in our industry\u2019s competitive environment. As an alternative, we could expand our efforts to distribute and market our products directly. This alternative, however, would require substantial investment in additional sales, marketing and logistics resources, including hiring additional sales and customer service personnel, which would significantly increase our future selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition, buying patterns of these two distributors may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, potentially leading to uneven concentration levels on a quarterly basis.\nSeasonal Factors and Sporadic Outbreaks\nOur principal business is the sale of a broad range of diagnostic test kits for common gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious diseases, and elevated blood lead levels. Certain infectious diseases may be seasonal in nature, while others may be associated with sporadic outbreaks, such as foodborne illnesses or pandemics such as an influenza outbreak or the current COVID-19\npandemic. While we believe that the breadth of our diagnostic product lines normally reduces the risk that infections subject to seasonality and sporadic outbreaks will cause significant variability in diagnostic revenues, the current COVID-19\npandemic did result in a significant decline in our Diagnostics revenues during the second half of fiscal 2020. Accordingly, we can make no assurance that revenues will not be negatively impacted period over period by such factors.\nChanging Diagnostic Market Conditions\nChanges in the U.S. health care delivery system have resulted in consolidation among reference laboratories, hospital laboratories being operated by large reference laboratories, and the formation of multi-hospital alliances, reducing the number of institutional customers for diagnostic test products. Consolidation in the U.S. health care industry has also led to the creation of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d) and IDNs that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices. Due to such consolidation, we may not be able to enter into and/or sustain contractual or other marketing or distribution arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with institutional customers, GPOs and/or IDNs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by health care reform legislation.\nThird-party payers for medical products and services, including state, federal and foreign governments, are increasingly concerned about escalating health care costs and can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for diagnostic testing services. Following years of increasing pressure, during 2010 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive health care reform with the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made changes that significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 requires applicable laboratories to report all private payor reimbursement rates and the volumes for each test they perform. The statute requires that Medicare establish reimbursement rates based on the weighted median of private insurance reimbursement rates effective January 1, 2017. The new Medicare rates would be subject to a maximum reduction of 10% a year for the initial three-year period and a maximum of 15% a year for the subsequent three-year period. There is no limit on the amount of potential rate increases. As a result, some of our customers in the United States may experience lower Medicare reimbursement rates for our products, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are seeing some effect on the reimbursement rates for our products. If reimbursement amounts for diagnostic testing services decrease further in the future, such decreases may reduce the amount that will be reimbursed to hospitals or physicians for such services and consequently, could place constraints on the levels of overall pricing, which could have a material effect on our revenues and/or results of operations.\n- 13 -\nAdditional state and federal health care reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our products and on our industry in general. For example, the United States government has in the past considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, health care policies and proposals intended to curb rising health care costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for health care services. Further, state and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the health care system in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether health care policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future, what effect such policies would have on our business, or the effect that ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nEfforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of the Budget Control Act passed in August 2011 to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending, $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts (known as sequestration) were implemented in 2013. The sequestration requires a 2% cut in Medicare payments for all services, including our diagnostic tests, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless Congressional action is otherwise taken. Government research funding has also been reduced as a result of the sequestration. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduces Medicare payments to providers such as hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increases the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nSuch reductions in government health care spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Further, there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels, including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the \u201cdebt ceiling.\u201d Any U.S. government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could, among other things, raise our borrowing costs. Any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRevenues for our Life Science segment may be impacted by customer concentrations and buying patterns.\nOur Life Science segment\u2019s revenues from three diagnostic manufacturing customers were 27% and 26% of the Life Science segment\u2019s total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, with such percentage for fiscal 2019 being concentrated in two of the customers. Sales to these three diagnostic manufacturing customers comprised 14% and 8% of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. In addition, in excess of 10% of the segment\u2019s total revenues has historically been concentrated among a number of other significant customers. Any significant alteration of buying patterns from these customers could adversely affect our period over period revenues and results of operations.\nWe expect to face increased competition resulting from expiration of our H. pylori patents.\nThe patents for our stool antigen H. pylori\nproducts, owned by us, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our stool antigen H. pylori\nproducts, high margin products which represent approximately 10% of our total revenues, to continue to increase, as we currently are one of only four companies that market FDA-cleared\ntests to detect H. pylori\nantigen in stool samples in the U.S. market, one of which is DiaSorin Inc., with whom we have entered a strategic collaboration agreement to sell H. pylori\ntests. At present, we are also aware of at least one other company that has commenced clinical trials of H. pylori\nproducts in the U.S. Such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. We have executed on a number of measures to address competitive pressures in coming off patent including: (i) in October 2018, we entered into a strategic collaboration with DiaSorin to sell H. pylori\ntests; (ii) we have executed multi-year supply agreements with our two largest reference laboratory customers for H. pylori\ntests to secure volume, albeit at lower selling prices; and (iii) upon FDA clearance in March 2020, we launched Curian HpSA, our first assay on the new Curian platform, which we expect will help protect our existing customer base using lateral flow tests. We also expect the acquisition of the Exalenz BreathID platform to combat competitive pressures, as we believe that we are now the only company with FDA-cleared,\nnon-invasive\nassays for both stool antigen and urea breath samples, allowing physicians a choice in test format from one supplier. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any strategy or that any strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit.\n- 14 -\nWe depend on international revenues, and our financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency, regulatory or other developments affecting international markets.\nWe sell products and services into approximately 70 countries. For fiscal 2020, approximately one third of our consolidated revenues were transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, and New Israeli shekel. We are also subject to other risks associated with international operations, including longer customer payment cycles, trade wars, increased tariffs, requirements for export licenses, instability of foreign governments, and governmental requirements with respect to the importation and distribution of medical devices and immunodiagnostic and molecular biology reagents, all of which may vary by country.\nNew tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe current U.S. administration has expressed strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and it is possible the administration could impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include countries from which we import components or raw materials. We are currently not aware of any new import duties imposed on our products. Any such new import duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.\nOther foreign governments are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. A \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, manufacturers, suppliers and/or the economic environments in which we operate and, thus may adversely impact our businesses. In addition, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which is still subject to approval by the United States, Mexico and Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. Any changes to NAFTA (or subsequent trade agreements) could impact our operations in countries where we manufacture or sell products, or source components or materials, which could adversely affect our operating results and our business.\nRisks Affecting our Manufacturing Operations\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation, and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations.\nMedical device diagnostics is a highly regulated industry. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary governmental clearances or approvals, or timely clearances or approvals, to market future products in the United States and other countries. Costs and difficulties in complying with laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the Centers for Disease Control, or other regulators can result in unanticipated expenses and delays, and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products.\nRegulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of approvals difficult to predict. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in delays in obtaining authorization to sell products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture or sell products, and other civil or criminal sanctions.\n- 15 -\nIf we or our third-party vendors fail to comply with FDA regulations relating to the manufacturing of our products or any component part, we may be subject to fines, injunctions and penalties, and our ability to commercially distribute and sell our products may be negatively impacted.\nOur diagnostics manufacturing facilities, and the manufacturing facilities of any of our third-party diagnostic component manufacturers or critical suppliers, are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which sets forth minimum standards for the procedures, execution and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of the products we sell, and related regulations, including Medical Device Reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) regulations regarding reporting of certain malfunctions and adverse events potentially associated with our products. The FDA may evaluate our compliance with the QSR, MDR and other regulations, among other ways, through periodic announced or unannounced inspections which could disrupt our operations and interrupt our manufacturing. If in conducting an inspection of our manufacturing facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of any of our third-party component manufacturers or critical suppliers, an FDA investigator observes conditions or practices believed to violate the QSR, the investigator may document their observations on a Form FDA 483 that is issued at the conclusion of the inspection. A manufacturer that receives an FDA 483 may respond in writing and explain any corrective actions taken in response to the inspectional observations. The FDA will typically review the facility\u2019s written response and may re-inspect\nto determine the facility\u2019s compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to take adequate and timely corrective actions to remedy objectionable conditions listed on an FDA 483 could result in the FDA taking administrative or enforcement actions. Among these may be the FDA\u2019s issuance of a Warning Letter to a manufacturer, which informs it that the FDA considers the observed violations to be of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d that, if not corrected, could result in further enforcement action.\nFDA enforcement actions, which include seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution, and civil penalties, could result in total or partial suspension of a facility\u2019s production and/or distribution, product recalls, fines, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of product applications, and/or the FDA\u2019s issuance of adverse publicity. Thus, an adverse inspection could force a shutdown of our manufacturing operations or a recall of our products. Adverse inspections could also delay FDA approval of our products and could have an adverse effect on our production, sales and profitability.\nWe and any of our third-party vendors may also encounter other problems during manufacturing including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede our ability to meet demand. The manufacture of our product also subjects us to risks that could harm our business, including problems relating to our facilities and errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in shipment of our products. Any interruption or delay in the manufacture of the product, or any of its components could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products, which could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn June 29, 2017, the FDA, in connection with its Safety Notification related to Magellan (whom we acquired in March 2016) and its lead testing systems for venous blood samples, issued its Form 483, Inspectional Observations, to Magellan. This was followed by the FDA issuing a Warning Letter related to the matter on October 23, 2017. During October 2019, the FDA conducted a follow-up\ninspection of Magellan\u2019s manufacturing facility. In connection with this follow-up\ninspection, the FDA issued five Form 483 observations. Over the last year, we have submitted a number of written responses to the FDA regarding the five Form 483 observations issued in the October 2019 inspection, and have worked diligently to execute a remediation plan. During October 2020, the FDA issued Establishment Inspection Reports which closed out the inspections from June 2017 and October 2019 under 21 C.F.R.20.64 (d) (3). The Warning Letter issued in October 2017 remains outstanding, pending a future FDA inspection. While we remain committed to strengthening Magellan\u2019s quality system and ensuring that all aspects of the system are in full compliance, we can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful to a degree acceptable by the FDA.\nAdditionally, as set forth in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, on April 17, 2018, Magellan received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regarding its LeadCare product line. The subpoena outlines documents to be produced, and we are cooperating with the DOJ in this matter. We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with applicable regulatory agencies and requirements, and are working with the DOJ to promptly respond to the subpoena, including responding to additional information requests. We have executed tolling agreements to extend the statute of limitations. We cannot predict when the investigation will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation, or its potential impact on Meridian.\n- 16 -\nSee a more detailed discussion of these matters within MD&A on page 28.\nSignificant interruptions in production at our principal manufacturing facilities and/or third-party manufacturing facilities would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nProducts and services manufactured at facilities we own or lease comprised a majority of our revenues. Our global supply of these products and services is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. In addition, we currently rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our diagnostic products and product components. The operations of our facilities or these third-party manufacturing facilities could be adversely affected by power failures, or natural or other disasters such as earthquakes, floods, tornadoes or terrorist threats. Although we carry insurance to protect against certain business interruptions at our facilities, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any significant interruption in the Company\u2019s or a third-party supplier\u2019s manufacturing capabilities could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on sole-source suppliers for certain critical raw materials, components and finished products. A supply interruption could adversely affect our business.\nRaw Materials and Components\nOur diagnostic products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are biological or chemical in nature, and that generally are available from multiple sources of supply. We sole-source certain raw materials and components, which makes it time consuming and costly to switch raw materials and components in FDA-cleared\nproducts. If certain suppliers fail to supply required raw materials or components, we will need to secure other sources which may require us to conduct additional development and testing and obtain regulatory approval. These activities require significant time and resources, and there is no assurance that new sources will be secured or regulatory approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.\nWe utilize third-party manufacturers for certain of our instrumentation. One third party manufactures our proprietary Alethia Incubator/Reader (instrument), a component of our Alethia molecular system, and an additional third party manufactures our Curian instrument. These instruments are manufactured exclusively for Meridian according to our specifications. While other manufacturers for these types of instruments are available, we source each instrument solely from one manufacturer to limit the costs involved in clearing the system for marketing in the United States. If these third-party manufacturers fail to supply us with instruments, we will need to secure another manufacturer, and it may take as long as 12 months to transfer instrument manufacturing. An interruption in the manufacturing of these instruments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAdditionally, one third party manufactures a certain reagent for use with our Alethia assays. While alternative suppliers exist, we elect to utilize this third party exclusively in order to maintain consistency in our materials, which is critical in complying with FDA regulatory requirements. An interruption in the manufacturing of these reagents could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nFinished Products\nWe outsource the manufacturing for certain finished diagnostic products to third parties. A disruption in the supply of these finished products could have a material adverse effect on our business until we find another supplier or bring manufacturing in-house.\nFour products manufactured exclusively for us by two separate and independent companies accounted for 7%, 11% and 11% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Meridian owns all rights and title to the FDA 510(k) clearances for these products.\nActivities undertaken by Meridian to reduce the risk of these sole-supplier arrangements include maintaining adequate inventory levels, supplier qualification procedures, supplier audits, site visits, and frequent communication. Additionally, we have identified potential alternate suppliers.\n- 17 -\nOur ability to meet future customer demand for selected products is dependent upon our ability to successfully manage our manufacturing capacity.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth effectively, it may become necessary for us to enhance our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, infrastructure and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and controls. Organizational growth and scale-up\nof operations could strain our existing managerial, operational, financial, and other resources. If our management is unable to effectively prepare for our expected future growth, our expenses may increase more than anticipated, our revenue could grow more slowly than expected, and we may not be able to achieve our commercialization, profitability, or product development goals. Our failure to effectively implement the necessary processes and procedures and otherwise prepare for our anticipated growth could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results and condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Product Liability\nWe may be unable to protect or obtain proprietary rights that we utilize or intend to utilize.\nIn developing and manufacturing our products, we employ a variety of proprietary and patented technologies. In addition, we have licensed, and expect to continue to license, various complementary technologies and methods from academic institutions and public and private companies. We cannot provide assurance that the technologies that we own or license provide protection from competitive threats or from challenges to our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in obtaining and retaining licenses, or proprietary or patented technologies, in the future.\nProduct infringement claims by other companies could result in costly disputes and could limit our ability to sell our products.\nLitigation over intellectual property rights is prevalent in the diagnostic industry. As the market for diagnostics continues to grow and the number of participants in the market increases, we may increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims. It is possible that a third party may claim infringement against us. If found to infringe, we may attempt to obtain a license to such intellectual property; however, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if our products are found to infringe on third-party intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages for past infringement and lose the ability to sell certain products, causing our revenues to decrease. Any substantial loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit or cease sales of our products.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease sales of our products. We currently carry product liability insurance at a level we believe is commercially reasonable, although there is no assurance that it will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. In certain customer contracts, we indemnify third parties for certain product liability claims related to our products. These indemnification obligations may cause us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. In addition, a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injury and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n- 18 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe authority of our board to issue preferred stock and the effects of certain provisions of Ohio corporation law may discourage takeover bids.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of such shares without any future vote or action by the shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Ohio corporation law contains provisions that may discourage takeover bids for our company that have not been negotiated with the board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital at a price favorable to us.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to numerous factors, including but not limited to the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. In addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Market and the market for diagnostics companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence. A loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class-action litigation. Class-action litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism, an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. If a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal is made with respect to us, we could incur significant costs in defending our company, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of our company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will resume the payment of dividends.\nThe declaration, amount and timing of the Company\u2019s dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws, including the applicable provisions of Ohio law, and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. We suspended the payment of quarterly cash dividends effective during the fiscal 2019 second quarter. Any action to resume the payment of dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our board of directors may deem relevant. Ongoing suspension of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIntense competition could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by substantial competition and rapid change. Hundreds of companies around the world supply diagnostic tests and immunoassay and molecular reagents. These companies range from multinational health care entities, for which diagnostics is one line of business, to small start-up\ncompanies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We cannot provide assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors.\n- 19 -\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States, and failure to comply with these laws could harm our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and/or make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract, hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified personnel, including our executive officers and scientific, technical, sales and marketing employees, and their ability to manage growth successfully. If such key employees were to leave and we were unable to obtain adequate replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur bank credit agreement imposes restrictions with respect to our operations.\nOur bank credit agreement contains a number of financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. If we fail to comply with the obligations in the credit agreement, we would be in default under the credit agreement. If an event of default is not cured or waived, it could result in acceleration of any indebtedness under our credit agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. At September 30, 2020, we had $68,824 outstanding on a $160,000 bank revolving credit facility.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the credit facility and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out\nor replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe face risks related to global economic conditions.\nWe currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets, provides us with discretionary funding capacity for research and development and other strategic activities. However, as an enterprise with global operations and markets, our operations and financial performance are in part dependent upon global economic conditions, and we could be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments. We are particularly susceptible to the economic conditions in countries where government-sponsored health care systems are the primary payers for health care, including those countries within the European Union that are reducing their public expenditures in an effort to achieve cost savings. The uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. As such, if global economic conditions deteriorate significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day\ntransactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. While to-date\nsuch factors have not had a significant negative impact on our results or operations, we continue to monitor and plan for the potential impact of these global economic factors.\n- 20 -\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The U.K. is currently in a transition period relating to its exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). In January 2020, the U.K. and the European Union ratified a Withdrawal Agreement that set out the transition period of eleven months, from February 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, during which the final terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure would be negotiated. Although the Withdrawal Agreement ensures that a \u201cno-deal\u201d\nor \u201ccliff-edge\u201d Brexit was avoided on January 31, 2020, there is no certainty that a similar effect will be avoided at the end of 2020.\nThe ongoing uncertainty on the final terms of the withdrawal could lead to economic stagnation until an ultimate resolution with respect to Brexit occurs. If the U.K. and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable agreements during the transition period or if other European Union Member States pursue withdrawal, it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility. In the absence of future trade deals, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world may be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. Additionally, the movement of goods and personnel between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the European Union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Even if final terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union are approved, the withdrawal could result in significant changes to the trading relationship between the U.K. and the European Union. These changes to the trading relationship between the U.K and the European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of our operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which could increase the cost of goods imported into the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of our operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar may also cause local currency results of our operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. With a range of outcomes still possible, the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend, in part, on the final outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.\nOne or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur operations involve the use of multiple systems that process, store and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results and strategies. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis, which include, but are not limited to, attempts to access systems and information, computer viruses, or denial-of-service\nattacks. These risks and threats range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and information and mitigate potential risks, including employee training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business due to disruption of operations and/or reputational damage, potential liability and increased remediation and protection costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In an effort to mitigate the financial impact such an attack might have on the Company, we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage. However, such coverage may be insufficient to cover the full impact of a cyber-attack. Additionally, as cybersecurity risks become more sophisticated, we may need to increase our investments in security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the United States and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the United States and in areas outside of the United States in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for, or cause interruptions in, the supply of materials from our suppliers.\n- 21 -", "PERMNO": 10530, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "VIVO"}
