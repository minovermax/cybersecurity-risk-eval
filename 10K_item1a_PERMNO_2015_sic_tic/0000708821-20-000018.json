{"cik": "708821", "company": "PAR TECHNOLOGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A\nRisk Factors.\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred losses in each of the last several years, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each of the last several years, including the year ended December 31, 2019, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in transforming our restaurant/retail business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in transforming our business or in achieving or sustaining profitability in the future.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of our revenue recognition and our ability to accurately forecast sales, including subscription software sales and renewals.\nOur revenues and other results of operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the foreseeable future as our Restaurant/Retail segment continues its transformation from a hardware and systems integrator to a software driven solutions provider, including offering and delivering our software as a service - SaaS. As revenues from our cloud offerings increase, we may experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our SaaS offerings and our traditional on-premise software and hardware sales. The SaaS delivery model is subscription based; accordingly, SaaS revenues are generally recognized ratably over the life of the subscriptions. In contrast, revenue from our on-premise software and hardware sales is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery. Accordingly, the SaaS delivery model creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition not associated with our traditional on-premise delivery model. A portion of our quarterly SaaS-based revenue results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our SaaS business model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected.\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operating subsidiaries to pay our debt.\nOn April 15, 2019, we sold $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (\u201c2024 notes\u201d) and on February 5, 2020, we sold $120 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 notes\u201d and together with the 2024 notes, the \"notes\")). We received approximately $115.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 notes, and used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase $66.25 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 notes. As of March 11, 2020, we had $133.75 million aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our operating subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to raise funds through debt or equity issuances, refinance our indebtedness, and otherwise access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operations.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including secured debt and debt issued or guaranteed by our subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing the notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our or their debt, or taking a number of other actions that could increase the total amount of our debt substantially.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay interest on the notes, to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, or to settle conversions of the notes in cash.\nWe are obligated to pay interest on the notes semi-annually in cash and, in certain circumstances, we are obligated to pay additional interest or special interest on the notes. If a fundamental change occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes in cash. Furthermore, upon conversion of any notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle the conversion (excluding cash in lieu of delivering fractional shares of our common stock), we must make cash payments in respect of the notes. Any of the cash payments described above could be significant, and we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing so that we can make such payments when due. If we fail to pay interest on the notes, repurchase the notes when required or deliver the consideration due upon conversion, we will be in default under both of the indentures governing the notes, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of the notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nCertain provisions in the indentures governing the notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the notes and the indentures could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nThe conversion of the notes could result in dilution of ownership to existing stockholders.\nHolders of the 2024 notes may elect to convert their notes at any time on or after October 15, 2023 and holders of the 2026 notes may elect to convert their notes at any time on or after October 15, 2025 and, upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the 2024 notes may convert their notes before October 15, 2023 and holders of the 2026 notes may convert their notes before October 15, 2025. We may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion will result in dilution of ownership to existing stockholders.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20. ASC 470-20 requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments whose conversion may be settled entirely or partially in cash (such as the notes) in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost for non-convertible debt. Initially, the liability component of the notes is valued at the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated equity component. Our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019 reflects the associated liability of our 2024 notes and includes the equity component of the 2024 notes as additional paid-in capital; the value of that equity component was treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. The 2026 notes will be similarly treated and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020. Original issue discount is amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the notes, accordingly, in connection with the 2024 notes we record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods as a result of the amortization of the 2024 notes. The original issue discount associated with the 2026 notes will have a similar impact. Accordingly, we currently report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires the interest expense associated with the 2024 notes to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the 2024 notes\u2019 coupon interest; we expect a similar impact on our net income from the 2026 notes. Our reporting of lower net income could adversely affect our reported or future financial results and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments whose conversion may be settled entirely or partly in cash (such as the notes) are currently accounted for using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share unless the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount at the end of the relevant reporting period. If the conversion value exceeds their principal amount, then, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the notes are accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle the excess, if we elected to settle the excess in shares, are issued. The accounting standards in the future may not continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. For example, the FASB recently published an exposure draft proposing\nto amend these accounting standards to eliminate the treasury stock method for convertible instruments and instead require application of the \"if-converted\" method. Under that method, if it is adopted, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the notes were converted solely into shares of our common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be dilutive. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks presented by our recent acquisitions, which - if realized - could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOn September 30, 2019, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ParTech, Inc., we acquired assets of the 3M Company\u2019s Drive-Thru Communications Systems business. In addition, on December 18, 2019 through ParTech Inc., we acquired 100% of the limited liability company interests of Restaurant Magic. Risks associated with these acquisitions, if realized, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations include timing and complexity of integration, our inability to realize or maximize anticipated financial and strategic positions, unanticipated costs and prevailing economic conditions, including fluctuations in supply of, demand for, and pricing of, our drive-thru communication systems products and our restaurant software offerings.\nOur products might experience coding or configuration errors, which could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from purchasing our products.\nAlthough we test our products and updates prior to their release and throughout their intended life, our cloud and on-premise software and hardware products sometimes contain coding or configuration errors that can negatively impact their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities. Coding and configuration errors can expose us to product liability, performance issues, warranty claims, and harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information; we are also subject to cyber-attacks. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws or a cyber-attack could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security, including recently enacted laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the New York SHIELD Act, which provide for fines and potential liability to consumers. Likewise, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the GDPR, which became fully effective in May 2018, imposes obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers, any one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or changes in these laws and regulations, may be onerous and expensive and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance.\nMoreover, allegations of non-compliance, whether or not true, could be costly, time consuming, distracting to management, and could cause reputational harm. Illustrative of this risk, on March 21, 2019, Kandice Neals on behalf of herself and others similarly situated (the \u2018\u2018Neals Plaintiff\u2019\u2019) filed a complaint against PAR Technology Corporation in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois County Department, Chancery Division. The complaint asserted that PAR Technology Corporation violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act in the alleged collection, use, and storage of her and others\u2019 biometric data derived from fingerprint scans taken for authentication purposes on point-of-sale systems. The Neals lawsuit was removed to the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) and was subsequently dismissed on December 19, 2019 without prejudice. On January 15, 2020, the Neals Plaintiff filed an amended complaint against ParTech, Inc. with the District Court. On January 29, 2020, ParTech filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the amended complaint. While we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense, we will need to spend money, time, and attention to defend against the complaint. We have been notified by our insurance carriers that they do not intend to cover our litigation expenses or any losses incurred by us in connection with this matter.\nWe have established practices and procedures intended to protect our systems and information against cyber-attacks. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent all cyber-attacks from impacting our systems and information. Our\nsystems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. Even though prior incidents did not have a material adverse effect on our systems and operations, there can be no assurance that the same will be the case in the future. A failure or interruption of our systems or those of our third-party providers may, and could in the future, result in operational disruptions, costly governmental investigations, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information, including interruption of systems availability or denial of access to and misuse of applications or information required by our customers to conduct their business. Any operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data) could harm our relationship with our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nIf our technical and maintenance support services are not satisfactory to our customers, they may not renew their services agreements or buy future products, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur business relies on our customers\u2019 satisfaction with the technical and maintenance support services we provide to support our products. If we fail to provide technical and maintenance support services that are responsive, satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations, and timely resolve issues that they encounter with our products, then they may not purchase additional products or services from us in the future.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to hire and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled individuals with software development, engineering, and technical skills. Competition is intense in the skill-sets we require, including in our Brink POS business and our Restaurant/Retail segment generally, and we have experienced challenges in our recruiting efforts. If we grow quickly without recruiting adequate teams, we may not be able to keep up with the needs of our customers and our restaurant/retail business, including our Brink POS business, and reputation may be harmed. Moreover, many positions in our Government business require security clearances, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain, resulting in increased competition for such uniquely qualified individuals. Our failure to hire and retain qualified developers, engineers, and other technical and skilled employees to contribute to our business could adversely affect our ability to not only perform our current contract obligations, but to innovate and rapidly and effectively change and introduce new products and services, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThree customers account for a significant portion of our revenues in the Restaurant/Retail segment. The loss of one of these customers, or a significant reduction, delay, or cancellation of purchases by one of these customers, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRevenues from our Restaurant/Retail segment constituted 66% and 67% of our total consolidated revenues for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Aggregate sales to our three largest customers (which include sales to those three customers\u2019 respective franchisees) - McDonald\u2019s Corporation, Yum! Brands, Inc., which consists of the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut brands, and Dairy Queen, constituted consolidated revenues for 2019 of 16% (McDonald\u2019s) 25% (Yum!) and 13% (Dairy Queen). Consolidated revenue for each of these three customers in 2018 - consisted of 19% (McDonald\u2019s) and 13% (Yum!). There were no other customers that comprised greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenues during these years. Significant reductions, delays, or cancellation of orders by one of these customers, or the loss of one of these customers, would reduce our revenue and operating income and would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism.\nShareholder activism can be disruptive to our business, divert the attention of our management and employees, and result in significant additional expense to us. In addition, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from activists' demands or messaging could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, exploitation by our competitors, and concern to our current or potential customers, and could make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe face extensive competition in our markets, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nThe markets for our software and hardware products are characterized by rapid technological advances, intense competition among existing and emerging competitors, evolving industry standards, emerging business, distribution and support models, disruptive technology developments, and frequent new product introductions.\nWhile we think our software and hardware products offer competitive, innovative features and functionality, any one of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect sales to our existing customers, as well as our ability to attract and sell to new customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate and identify changes in customer needs and/or relevant technologies and to rapidly and effectively introduce new and innovative products, features, and functions; it also depends on our ability to effectively communicate with our customers and quickly respond to our customers\u2019 requirements, which are areas in which we have experienced challenges. If we fail in these efforts, our business, results of operations, and financial conditions could suffer. Any delay in the development, marketing, or launch of new products or enhancements to our existing products, or failure to effectively communicate or meet our customers\u2019 requirements could result in reduced sales, performance penalties, or termination of contracts, and could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings, or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\nPart of our competitive strategy is to enter into new market segments and attract larger customers that operate in different Restaurant/Retail spaces, particularly in the table-service market. If we are not successful in penetrating markets that our competitors are already active in or in securing new customers, or if we lose current customers, our business, financial condition, and operating results may suffer.\nOur government contracting business has been focused on niche offerings reflecting our expertise, primarily in the areas of ISR, systems engineering & evaluation, satellite and telecommunications services, and management technology/systems services. Many of our competitors in the Government segment are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. We also compete with smaller companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential \u201cset aside\u201d treatment, that target particular segments of the government market and may have superior capabilities in a particular segment. These companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals. Consequently, there are no assurances we will continue to win government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor, and our failure to do so would reduce our revenue and operating income and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe consequences of activities that were the subject of our internal investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn 2016, our Audit Committee commenced an internal investigation into conduct at our China and Singapore offices to determine whether certain import/export and sales documentation activities were improper and in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other applicable laws, and certain of our internal policies. We voluntarily notified the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) of the internal investigation. Following the conclusion of the Audit Committee's internal investigation, we voluntarily reported the relevant findings of the investigation to the China and Singapore authorities.\nIn early April 2019, the SEC notified us that based on current information, it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against us; shortly thereafter, the DOJ advised us that it did not intend to separately proceed. We are cooperating with the China and Singapore authorities; however, we are currently unable to predict what actions the China and Singapore agencies might take, or what the likely outcome of any such actions might be, or estimate the range of reasonably possible fines or penalties, and such actions, fines and/or penalties could be material, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected, and we may become subject to regulatory investigation or sanctions.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC could be adversely affected, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we could be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC, DOJ, or other governmental agencies (including foreign government agencies). Any such consequence or other negative effect could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have in the past reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, most recently in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017. We cannot assure you that we will not report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in future periods.\nThere are risks related to the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d).\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management and sales teams. In October 2019 we went live on the first phase of implementation of the ERP. The implementation will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs, and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement complete implementation of the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations, including compliance with international laws, which may harm our business.\nAlthough only 6% and 7% for 2019 and 2018, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues were derived from sales outside of the U.S., we have operations across the globe, and our international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our software and hardware in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including fines, penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nincreased risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries and practical difficulties and costs of enforcing those rights abroad;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u2022\nuncertainty around international trade agreements and partnerships under President Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration;\n\u2022\nsales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in receiving payments from different geographies, including difficulties associated with currency fluctuations, payment cycles, transfer of funds, or collecting accounts receivable, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nvariations in economic or political conditions between each country or region;\n\u2022\nwidespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 (or coronavirus), or other adverse public health issues or natural disasters in countries where we operate; and\n\u2022\nincreased infrastructure and legal compliance costs.\nSignificant changes in U.S. and international trade policies that restrict imports or increase tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the manufacture of certain of our products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international manufacturing. For example, the Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy, including imposing greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our manufacturing costs, and in turn, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIssues with product and component availability or supplier performance may affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products.\nWe depend on our suppliers to deliver hardware and related materials, product assemblies, and components in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance with contract terms and applicable laws and regulations. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. If certain materials, components or product assemblies are not available or if any of these suppliers otherwise fails to meet our needs or becomes insolvent, we may not have readily available alternative sources for such materials, components or product assemblies. While we enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with some suppliers and take other actions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components, and products, we cannot be sure that the materials, product assemblies or components will be available or in the needed quantities and quality or at favorable or competitive prices. If we experience a material supplier problem, it could negatively impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations. This could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts, and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers. We could also incur additional costs in addressing this type of problem, including identifying and qualifying alternative sources. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 (or coronavirus) could harm our business.\nThe recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has caused disruption to our suppliers and their manufacturers located in China and elsewhere. We are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our business, and have taken steps to mitigate the impact on our supply chain, including increasing safety stock inventory and the use of alternative sources when possible. The severity of the impact will depend on how long and widespread the disruption proves to be, both within and outside of China. If our suppliers or their manufacturers are severely affected, our supply chain could be materially disrupted and our business could be adversely affected.\nA portion of Government segment revenue is derived from U.S. Government contracts, which contain provisions unique to public sector customers, including the U.S. Government\u2019s right to modify or terminate these contracts at any time.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we derived 34% and 33%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues from contracts to provide technical expertise to government organizations and prime contractors. In any given year, the majority of our government contracting activity is associated with the U.S. Department of Defense. Contracts with the U.S. Government typically provide that such contracts are terminable, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. Government. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract on this basis, we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and, in general, a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed. Most U.S. Government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding. As such, we may perform work prior to formal authorization, or the contract prices may be adjusted for changes in scope of work. Termination or modification of a substantial number of our U.S. Government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe perform work for various U.S. Government agencies and departments pursuant to fixed-price, cost-plus fixed fee and time-and-material prime contracts and subcontracts. Approximately 56% of revenues derived from government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019 were based on fixed-price or time and material contracts, and the balance (approximately 40% of total government revenues) was based on cost-plus fixed fee contracts. Most of our contracts are for one-year to five-year terms.\nWhile fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use for calculating the contract price are incorrect, we can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of our governmental contracts have provisions relating to cost controls, and audit rights and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize the full benefit of the contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nUnder time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee. If our costs under either of these types of contracts were to exceed the contract ceiling, or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be reimbursed for 100% of our associated costs. Our inability to control our costs under either a time-and-materials contract or a cost-plus fixed fee contract could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.\nOur Government segment could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the U.S. Government, failure to approve U.S. Government budgets on a timely basis, or delays in contract awards and other procurement activities.\nOur Government segment depends upon continued U.S. Government expenditures on defense, intelligence, homeland security, and other programs that we support. Changes in U.S. Government budgetary priorities, a significant decline in government expenditures, or a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (\u201cCR\u201d) that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year. When the U.S. Government operates under a CR, it may delay funding we expect to receive from customers on work we are already performing and will likely result in new initiatives being delayed or in some cases canceled, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFailure to comply with a variety of complex procurement regulations could result in liability for various penalties or sanctions including termination of U.S. Government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. Government contracts, and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting.\nOur Government segment is subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and increase our performance costs. Among the most significant laws and regulations are:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d) and agency regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nthe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the FCPA or U.S. export control regulations, which apply when we engage in international work; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data.\nFailure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government, civil and/or criminal fines, and penalties. Any such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe cannot guarantee that our Government segment's estimated contract backlog will result in actual revenue.\nOur backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of the contracts. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. There is a higher degree of risk with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change; the program could be canceled; a contract could be reduced, modified, or terminated early; or an option that we had assumed could not be exercised. Further, while many of our U.S. Government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. Consequently, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Our estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. However, there can be no assurances that all, or any, of such estimated contract backlog will be recognized as revenue.\nThe U.S. Government may revise its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to our Government segment.\nThe U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) contracts, Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (\u201cGWACs\u201d) or other multi-award contracts, or adopt new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain social or other policy objectives. In addition, the U.S. Government may face restrictions from new legislation or regulations, as well as pressure from U.S. Government employees and their unions, on the nature and amount of\nservices the U.S. Government may obtain from private contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are up for recompete. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, and as a result, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. A realignment of funds with changed U.S. Government priorities, including \u201cinsourcing\u201d of previously contracted support services, and the realignment of funds to other non-defense-related programs may reduce the amount of funds available to defense-related and other programs in our core service areas.\nOur Government segment is subject to reviews, audits, and cost adjustments by the U.S. Government, which, if unfavorably resolved to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, or growth prospects.\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, and the Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors\u2019 administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another U.S. Government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to claims by third-parties of intellectual property and/or proprietary rights infringement.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software, hardware platforms, or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, non-practicing entities have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products - in particular POS cloud software products - that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to a periodic impairment analysis. A significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, even without a significant loss of our revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nOur goodwill was approximately $41.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $11.1 million December 31, 2018, and our intangibles were $32.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $10.9 million at December 31, 2018. Identifiable intangible assets were primarily a result of business acquisitions and internally developed capitalized software. We test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate possible impairment. We describe the impairment testing process and results of this testing more thoroughly in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d If we determine an impairment has occurred at any point in time, we will be required to reduce goodwill or identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. Additional information about our impairment testing is contained in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report).\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we presently intend to continue to retain earnings for reinvestment in growth opportunities. Future cash dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our board of directors, and the amount of cash dividends per share will depend on, among other things, our future earnings, financial condition, results of operations, level of indebtedness, capital requirements and surplus, contractual restrictions, and the number of shares of common stock outstanding,\nas well as the legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. It is anticipated that no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock or our other securities could depress the price of our common stock.\nWe may issue and sell additional shares of common stock or other securities in subsequent offerings to raise capital or issue shares for other purposes, including in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We cannot predict (i) the size of future issuances of equity securities, (ii) the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into equity securities or (iii) the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of the common stock. Transactions involving newly issued common stock could result in dilution, possibly substantial, to security holders.\nAs required under the interest purchase agreement dated November 7, 2019 (the \u201cInterest Purchase Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired Restaurant Magic, we registered 908,192 shares of our common stock with the SEC for resale (Registration No. 333-236361, the \u201cInitial Registration Statement\u201d). These shares were issued by us to the sellers as partial purchase price consideration. The sellers have the opportunity to earn additional purchase price consideration subject to the achievement of post-closing revenue focused milestones (\u2018\u2018Earn-Out\u2019\u2019). The Earn-Out, if any, is payable 50% in cash, subordinated promissory notes or a combination of cash and subordinated promissory notes, at our election, and 50% in restricted shares of our common stock (the \u2018\u2018Earn-Out Shares\u2019\u2019). Pursuant to the Interest Purchase Agreement, we agreed to prepare and file, within 60 days after the issuance of any Earn-Out Shares, one or more registration statements with the SEC to register for resale the Earn-Out Shares (each an \u201cEarn-Out Registration Statement\u201d and together with the Initial Registration Statement, the \u201cRestaurant Magic Registration Statements\u201d) and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable registration statements to be declared effective as soon as practicable. The number of Earn-Out Shares will be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the consecutive 20 trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable earn-out payment date.\nAccordingly, up to 908,192 shares of our common stock may be sold from time to time pursuant to the Initial Registration Statement and additional Earn-Out Shares may be issued, and sold pursuant to any Earn-Out Registration Statement. In addition, of the 18,275,044 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 11, 2020, our executive officers and directors own 12.4%, of which 11.4% are owned by John W. Sammon. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our existing stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, including the perception that securities granted under our equity compensation plans will be sold in the public market, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. A decline in the market price of our common stock or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our actual operating performance.\nA number of factors can impact the trading price of our common stock, many of which are outside our control. The stock market in general is subject to fluctuations that affect the share prices and trading volumes of many companies, and these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect our common stock price include but are not necessarily limited to the following:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock from time to time pursuant to the Restaurant Magic Registration Statements;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nthe performance and prospects of our major customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe concentrated beneficial ownership of our common stock by our founder and director, John W. Sammon;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated regulatory action against us;\n\u2022\nthe lack of earnings guidance and minimal securities analysts following us;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding domestic and international political conditions, including tax policies; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or negative recommendations with respect to our common stock, the price of our common stock, and consequently the trading price for the notes, could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research and other securities analysts publish about us, our business, and our industry. We do not have control over these analysts. Analysts could issue negative\nrecommendations with respect to our common stock or publish other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us, our business, or our industry. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the market price of our common stock could decline rapidly and our common stock trading volume could be adversely affected.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u2018\u2018DGCL\u2019\u2019) or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories set forth in the exclusive forum provision and that also asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage a takeover of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, collectively:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nProvide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nPermits only the board of directors, or the chairman of the board of directors or the president pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the then authorized number of directors of the Company to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholder action by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all stockholders; and\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our board of directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.", "PERMNO": 61146, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "PAR"}
