{"cik": "50725", "company": "GRIFFON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nGriffon\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future.\nIn general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic, and the spread of the pathogen on a global basis could adversely affect our businesses in a number of respects, although the extent, nature and timing of such impact cannot be predicted as of the date of this filing. The COVID-19 outbreak has led countries around the world, as well as most states in the U.S., to implement restrictions from time-to-time relating to the operation of almost all types of businesses. Within the U.S., the standards vary from state to state, but typically require all but \u201ccritical\u201d, \u201cessential\u201d or \u201clife-sustaining\u201d businesses to close all offices and facilities. We believe, based on the various standards published to date, that our businesses meet the requisite standard in all U.S states. We also believe that our businesses meet the applicable standards to remain open in Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Australia. As of the date of this filing, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia and China are operating, although some of them are operating at reduced capacity as a result of our implementation of procedures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and staggered shifts. However, government actions taken based on the changing nature of the outbreak in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, as well as the changing of standards regarding what type of facilities are permitted to remain open and evolving interpretations of existing standards, could result in additional closures of Griffon facilities.\nOur supply chain has experienced certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, has resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. Commodity prices have increased during COVID-19 and may continue to increase, and we may not be able to pass off all or any of such price increases to our customers on a timely basis, or at all. It is difficult to predict whether the supply chain disruptions that impact us will improve, worsen or remain the same in the near term. Our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations in accordance with the various restrictions discussed above; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a proposed new rule requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees require that their employees be fully vaccinated or tested weekly. The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) issued an emergency temporary standard regulation to carry out this mandate. On November 6, 2021, the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay of the emergency temporary standard, and on November 12, 2021 the Court upheld its stay and barred OSHA from enforcing the mandate \u201cpending adequate judicial review\u201d of a motion for permanent injunction. At this time, it is unclear, among other things, when the vaccine mandate will go into effect (or if it will go into effect at all); whether it will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office; and how compliance will be documented.\nAs a company with more than 100 employees, it is anticipated that, should the vaccine mandate go into effect, we would be subject to the OSHA regulation concerning COVID-19 vaccination and the vaccine mandate. Should the mandate apply to us, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions. At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that a vaccine mandate, or a vaccine requirement should we adopt one, will have on us or on our workforce. Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, if implemented, may result in employee attrition, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter months, governments take additional protective actions, or extend the time period for existing protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffon\u2019s businesses and operating results. This could include additional closures of our facilities of an unknown duration, or the closure of the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. Any disruption of our supply chain or the businesses of our customers could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak has recently worsened in some U.S. states, and as a result, some states have put in place new restrictions regarding the operation of many types of businesses or have tightened up restrictions already in place. Many medical experts believe that during the winter, as the weather gets colder and more people spend time with others indoors, the COVID-19 infection rate will worsen. In addition, the widespread public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that has adversely impacted many businesses, including ours. The extent and duration of the impact on the global economy and financial markets from the COVID-19 outbreak is difficult to predict, and the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will negatively affect us and the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. The impact to our results will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, and the impact of such actions, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results. To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating\nresults, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.\nCurrent worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon\u2019s businesses.\nThe current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2022, particularly within the CPP and HBP segments, which is linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general. Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. These conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due. Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables.\nAdverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon\u2019s business.\nThe CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 54% and 46% of Griffon\u2019s consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which was dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP. To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.\nGriffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively.\nGriffon\u2019s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon\u2019s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.\nMany CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPP\u2019s or HBP\u2019s significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.\nTo address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon\u2019s financial results.\nThe loss of large customers can harm financial results.\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP. Home Depot accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated revenue, 26% of CPP's revenue and 10% HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon\u2019s largest customers, as well as Griffon\u2019s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon\u2019s revenue. Griffon\u2019s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk. The largest customer accounted for approximately 28%, 7% and 19% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon\u2019s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2021, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.\nA significant customer of our discontinued DE segment is the U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, and together accounts for approximately 69% of DE revenue.\nReliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair the ability of CPP and HBP to meet its customer demands.\nCPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 40% and 8%, respectively, in 2021. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 9% and 19%, respectively, in 2021. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP's and HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events may impact the ability of CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.\nRecently, one of our suppliers informed HBP that a component it supplies to HBP was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of one of its competitors. This supplier has assured HBP that it is developing an alternative design for such component that will allow it to continue to meet HBP\u2019s needs on an uninterrupted basis. However, should the supply of this component be interrupted, it could adversely impact HBP\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance.\nCPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod. Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases for most of its raw materials.\nWhile most key raw materials used in Griffon\u2019s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon\u2019s results of operations. Griffon\u2019s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon\u2019s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.\nCPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China\nCPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are sourced\nfrom China; and raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China.\nThe sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies or political changes.\nBecause of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The United States entered into what is described as \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade agreement with China on January 15, 2020, which reduces some existing tariffs that had been imposed and defers proposed increases of the tariff rate on an additional $250 billion of Chinese goods from 25% to 30% that had been planned for October 15, 2019, and proposed 15% tariffs on an additional $160 billion of a wide range of goods and materials imported from China to be effective December 15, 2019. Under the Phase 1 agreement, existing 25% tariffs previously imposed on $250 billion of Chinese goods will remain in place, while a 15% tariff on another $120 billion of Chinese goods has been reduced to 7.5%. In response, China has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products, some of which are being reduced as part of the Phase 1 agreement. China may take additional actions if additional U.S. tariffs are reduced or imposed. On May 8, 2020, the two countries reaffirmed their Phase 1 trade agreement notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021 the U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed the status of the Phase 1 agreement after the Biden administration outlined its agenda for trade policy with China. The Biden administration has indicated it will continue the strict tariffs against Chinese imports to maintain pressure on China to live up to its commitments under the Phase 1 agreement, while reinstating the process for U.S. importers to seek exclusions from the tariffs. In view of the early stage of re-engagement on trade policy between the Chinese and U.S. governments, any potential impact on our business remains uncertain. Any escalation of trade tensions or the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. Government on various steel and aluminum finished goods, as well as a variety of resins, fabrics and wood products could materially affect our operations. As a result of these tariffs and the fluid nature of ongoing trade negotiations, we intend to continue to manage our China supply base, which may include raising prices on certain goods. This may in turn result in reduced sales or the loss of customers and could impact our operating performance.\nThe continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in and may continue to cause retaliatory policies from both countries, including a recent executive order issued by the U.S. President eliminating the preferential trade status of Hong Kong in response to China\u2019s action to impose new security measures and regulation on Hong Kong. We cannot predict what new and additional retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to U.S. actions, and such policies and regulations may adversely affect our business operations in China.\nCPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products.\nThe ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition.\nGriffon\u2019s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns.\nGriffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the AMES and Clopay businesses. In 2021, 53% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% and 56% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales orders shifted somewhat into the third and fourth quarters resulting in revenue increasing in these two quarters to 55% in each of 2021 and 2020 sales. Clopay\u2019s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.\nTelephonics historically has had higher revenue and earnings in the second half of Griffon's fiscal year ending September 30 (although this has not always been the case).\nDemand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nUnionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage.\nAt September 30, 2021, Griffon employed approximately 6,700 people on a full-time basis, excluding approximately 700 related to Telephonics, approximately 5% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and CPP). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.\nTelephonics\u2019 business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget.\nTelephonics sells products to the U.S. Government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2021, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 10% of the combined revenue of Griffon\u2019s consolidated revenue and Telephonics revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including:\n\u2022Termination for default or for convenience by the government;\n\u2022Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government\u2019s requirements or budgetary constraints;\n\u2022Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics\u2019 prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;\n\u2022The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract under circumstances in which Telephonics is a subcontractor;\n\u2022Failure to observe and comply with government and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;\n\u2022The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;\n\u2022The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and\n\u2022The government\u2019s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.\nTelephonics\u2019 U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers.\nThe programs in which Telephonics participate may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics\u2019 development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing\nprograms or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.\nTelephonics\u2019 business could be adversely affected by a government shutdown\nThe impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics\u2019 revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics\u2019 business.\nTelephonics\u2019 business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government\nAs a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation.\nMany Telephonics contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within Telephonics' control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and overall profitability.\nTelephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of Telephonics' programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent Telephonics from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject Telephonics to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. Telephonics may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, Telephonics may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on Griffon's financial position.\nGriffon's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nGriffon and its operating companies are subjected to cyber and other security threats common to U.S. businesses. As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics, in particular, may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or highly confidential information that could compromise U.S. security. The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target Telephonics because of national security information in its possession. Individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including organizations sponsored by foreign countries, may use a wide variety of methods, such as deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to gain access to our networks or using social engineering techniques to induce our employees to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our systems, security or confidential information.\nIf Telephonics is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of its security processes and procedures and its compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, and the increasing difficulty of detecting and defending against them, the risk and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant. Security events such as these could adversely affect Griffon's internal operations, future financial results and reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from research and development efforts and other intellectual property.\nGriffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert management\u2019s attention.\nMaking strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon\u2019s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon\u2019s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, CornellCookson in June 2018, Apta in November 2019 and Quatro in December 2020. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.\nIn implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:\n\u2022Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;\n\u2022Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon\u2019s existing organization;\n\u2022Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;\n\u2022Diversion of management\u2019s attention; or\n\u2022Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAn unsuccessful implementation of Griffon\u2019s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWhile Griffon\u2019s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028, and while its $400 million revolving line of credit, which is largely undrawn and has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2025, there are potential impacts from Griffon\u2019s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.\nCompliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon\u2019s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.\nThe credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, which is largely undrawn, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.\nGriffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.\nGriffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.\nGriffon\u2019s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon\u2019s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.\nGriffon\u2019s indebtedness poses potential risks such as:\n\u2022A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders\u2019 equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon\u2019s common stock. While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 56,613,011 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2021. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEach of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.\nThe manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon\u2019s businesses and operating results.\nManufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGriffon\u2019s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon\u2019s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon\u2019s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.\nA lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities\nat or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.\nIn addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to pass along all or any of such increase to its customers; and when such increases are passed off to customers, there will be a time lag, which may be significant.\nIf CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.\nThe ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the company\u2019s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.\nGriffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGriffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.\nGriffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.\nGriffon\u2019s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively.\nThe markets for Griffon\u2019s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.\nGriffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon\u2019s products. In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon\u2019s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nProduct and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if:\n\u2022Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;\n\u2022New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;\n\u2022There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or\n\u2022New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.\nThe loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon\u2019s business.\nThe success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon\u2019s operating results or financial condition.\nGriffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.\nGriffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the U.K., Mexico and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.\nGriffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to export controls, laws and regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarment, loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business, and could harm the ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGriffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights.\nGriffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies.\nGriffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party.\nGriffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGriffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims.\nGriffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon\u2019s products (or in end-products in which Griffon\u2019s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity.\nGriffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nGriffon\u2019s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time.\nGriffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities.\nChanges in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.\nGriffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon\u2019s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon\u2019s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.\nActions taken by activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and may conflict with or disrupt the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and seek changes regarding Griffon\u2019s corporate governance or structure. Our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all shareholders who wish to speak with us, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all shareholders. However, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:\na.responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, and\nb.perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may cause (i) instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, (ii) concern on the part of current or potential customers, (iii) loss of business opportunities, or (iv) difficulties in attracting and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nActivist campaigns may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our businesses.", "PERMNO": 46463, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "GFF"}
