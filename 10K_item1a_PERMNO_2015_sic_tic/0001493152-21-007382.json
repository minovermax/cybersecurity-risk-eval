{"cik": "771999", "company": "DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section contained in Part II, Item 7, below, entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nFinancial Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created global economic turmoil and has potentially permanently impacted how many businesses operate and how individuals will socialize and shop in the future. The Company continues to feel the effect of the COVID-19 business shutdowns and consumer stay-at-home protections. But the effect of the economic shutdown has impacted our business lines differently, some more severely than others. In most cases we believe the negative economic trends and reduced sales will recover over time. However, management determined that one of its business lines, DSS Plastics, had been more severely impacted by the pandemic than our other divisions and we did not believe this was a short-term phenomenon. As a result, management decided to fully impair its goodwill related to DSS Plastics. The impact to DSS\u2019s 2020 first quarter earnings of this impairment was approximately $685,000.\nThe value of our intangible assets and investments may not be equal to their carrying values.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $23.4 million of net intangible assets. Approximately $22.3 million is associated with the acquisition of Impact Biomedical, Inc. The Company has completed valuations for certain developed technology assets acquired in the transaction as well the non-controlling interest portion of Impact BioMedical, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Approximately $267,000 of this amount are intangible assets which derive their value from patents or patent rights. If licensing efforts and litigation are not successful, the values of these assets could be reduced. We are required to evaluate the carrying value of such intangibles and goodwill and the fair value of investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset, including goodwill, and investment may not be recoverable. If any of our intangible assets, goodwill or investments are deemed to be impaired then it will result in a significant reduction of the operating results in such period. As noted above, management has determined that the goodwill of DSS Plastics has been permanently and materially impaired due to the global pandemic and other market factors.\nWe have secured indebtedness, and a potential risk exists that we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to pay interest and principal thereon when due or negotiate acceptable extensions or settlements.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness (described below), most of which is secured by assets of various DSS subsidiaries and guaranteed by the Company. Given our history of operating losses and our cash position, there is a risk that we may not be able to repay indebtedness when due. If we were to default on any of our other indebtedness that require payments of cash to settle such default and we do not receive an extension or a waiver from the creditor and the creditor were to foreclose on the secured assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following significant amounts of outstanding indebtedness:\n\u25cf $1,100,000 due under a promissory note with Citizens Bank used to purchase our packaging division facility. We are required to pay monthly instalments of $7,000 with interest fixed at 4.22% until June 2029, at which time a balloon payment of the remaining principal balance will be due. The promissory note is secured by a first mortgage on our packaging division facility.\n\u25cf $900,000 in a term note non-revolving line of credit with Citizens Bank used by Premier Packaging Corporation to purchase equipment. Effective on the Conversion Date, the interest shall be adjusted to a fixed rate equal to 2% above the bank\u2019s cost of funds, as determined by Citizens. The note had no borrowings against it as of December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf $771,000 in a term note non-revolving line of credit with Citizens Bank used by Premier Packaging Corporation to purchase equipment. The note is amortized over a 48-month period and payable in monthly instalments of $13,000. Interest accrues at 1 Month LIBOR plus 2.00%.\n\u25cf $800,000 revolving credit line with Citizens Bank by Premier Packaging payable in monthly instalments of interest only. The revolving credit line bears interest at 1 Month LIBOR plus 2.0% and had no borrowings against it at as of December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf $200,000 unsecured promissory note between AMRE and LiquidValue Asset Management Pte Ltd. The note calls for interest to be paid annually on March 2 with interest fixed at 8.0% and matures on March 2, 2022. The holder is a related party owned by the Chairman of the Company\u2019s board of directors.\n\u25cf $115,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established as part of CARES Act, and provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the SBA PPP program, the Company submitted an application for AAMI for a requested 100% loan forgiveness. In January 2021, AAMI received notification that the loan was forgiven under the guidelines of the CARES Act.\nThe Citizens credit facilities for the Company\u2019s subsidiary, Premier Packaging, contain various covenants including fixed charge coverage ratio, tangible net worth and current ratio covenants which are tested annually as of December 31. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Premier Packaging was in compliance with the annual covenants.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived by two customers.\nDuring 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2020, these two customers accounted for 60% of our trade accounts receivable balance. During 2019, these two customers accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2019, these two customers accounted for 49% of our trade accounts receivable balance. If we were to lose these customers or if the amount of business we do with these two customers declines significantly, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement or other claims against us, our customers or our intellectual property that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights.\nAlthough we have received patents with respect to certain of our core business technologies, there can be no assurance that these patents will afford us any meaningful protection. Although we believe that our use of the technology and products we have developed, and other trade secrets used in our operations do not infringe upon the rights of others, our use of the technology and trade secrets we developed may infringe upon the patents or intellectual property rights of others. In the event of infringement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to obtain a license or modify aspects of the technology and trade secrets we developed or refrain from using the same. We may not be able to successfully terminate any infringement in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition. Moreover, if the patents, technology or trade secrets we developed or use in our business are deemed to infringe upon the rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition. As we continue to market our products, we could encounter patent barriers that are not known today. A patent search may not disclose all related applications that are currently pending in the United States Patent Office, and there may be one or more such pending applications that would take precedence over any or all of our applications.\nFurthermore, third parties may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid, which could result in significant expenditures by us to refute such assertions. If we become involved in litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights, be subject to damages and incur substantial unexpected operating expenses. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, even if the claims are subsequently proven unfounded, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may not be able to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in defending claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, we may not be able to enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we are unsuccessful in our pending patent infringement litigation, we could lose certain patents that have been collateralized by third party funding partners. This could prohibit us from providing our products and services to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition.\nCertain of our recently developed products are not yet commercially accepted and there can be no assurance that those products will be accepted, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nOver the past several years, we have spent significant funds and time to create or acquire new products by applying our technologies onto media other than paper, including plastic and cardboard packaging, and delivery of our technologies digitally. We\u2019ve also acquired several patents in the bio-health field through our acquisition if Impact Biomedical, Inc. Our business plan includes plans to incur significant marketing, intellectual property development and sales costs for these newer products, particularly the bio-health related products. If we are not able to develop and sell these new products, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nThe results of our research and development efforts are uncertain and there can be no assurance of the commercial success of our products.\nWe believe that we will need to continue to incur research and development expenditures to remain competitive. The products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful. In addition, the length of our product development cycle may be greater than we originally expected, and we may experience delays in future product development. If our resulting products are not technologically successful, they may not achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with our competitors\u2019 products.\nChanges in document security technology and standards could render our applications and services obsolete.\nThe market for document security products, applications, and services is fast moving and evolving. Identification and authentication technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products, applications, and services, and retire old ones as customer requirements quickly develop and change. In addition, the standards for document security are continuing to evolve. If any segments of our market adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our applications and technology, sales to that market segments could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition.\nThe markets in which we operate is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and financial resources.\nOur markets are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and product innovations. Our competitors may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories, more established products, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Competition may also force us to decrease the price of our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new technology on a timely basis, new products with enhanced features, or that these products, if introduced, will enable us to establish selling prices and gross margins at profitable levels.\nIf we are unable to respond to regulatory or industry standards effectively, our growth and development could be delayed or limited.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products and services in accordance with regulatory or industry standards. Our ability to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to influence and respond to emerging industry governmental standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to influence these or other standards or respond to these or other standards effectively, our growth and development of various products and services could be delayed or limited.\nBreaches in security, whether cyber or physical, and other disruptions and/or our inability to prevent or respond to such breeches, could diminish our ability to generate revenues or contain costs, compromise our assets, and negatively impact our business in other ways.\nWe face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, and threats to physical and cyber security. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. The risks of a security breach, cyber-attack, cyber intrusion, or disruption, particularly through actions taken by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have acquired and developed systems and processes designed to protect our proprietary and/or classified information, they may not be sufficient and the failure to prevent these types of events could disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, and weaken our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations in Asia are subject to unique risks and uncertainties, including tariffs and trade restrictions.\nOur operating facility in Asia, in addition to our investment in Alset International Limited, presents risks including, but not limited to, changes in share price of investments, changes in local regulatory requirements, changes in labor laws, local wage laws, environmental regulations, taxes and operating licenses, compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, uncertainties as to application and interpretation of local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, currency restrictions, currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency, and currency revaluations, eminent domain claims, civil unrest, power outages, water shortages, labor shortages, labor disputes, increase in labor costs, rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or the threat of boycotts, other civil disturbances and the possible impact of the imposition of tariffs as a result of the tariff dispute between the U.S. and China as well as any retaliating trade policies or restrictions. Any such disruptions could depress our earnings and have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture growth in our business could make it difficult to manage our resources.\nFuture business expansion could place a significant strain on our management, administrative and financial resources. Significant growth in our business may require us to implement additional operating, product development and financial controls, improve coordination among marketing, product development and finance functions, increase capital expenditures and hire additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any substantial expansion of our business, including attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Any failure to properly manage our future growth could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to retain certain of our key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we might not be able to remain competitive, continue to expand our technology or pursue growth.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of certain of our executive officers and other key sales and research personnel who possess longstanding industry relationships and technical knowledge of our products and operations. Although we believe that our relationship with these individuals is positive, there can be no assurance that the services of these individuals will continue to be available to us in the future. There can be no assurance that these persons will agree to continue to be employed by us after the expiration dates of their current contracts.\nWe have identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting structure; any material weaknesses may cause errors in our financial statements that could require restatements of our financial statements and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have had previously identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting following management\u2019s annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and, as a result of that assessment, management had concluded our controls associated may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain any earnings and other cash resources for investment in our business. The payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our operations, financial position, financial requirements, general business conditions, restrictions imposed by financing arrangements, if any, legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe may seek to develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and would be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nPart of our business may include the development of new inventions and intellectual property that we would seek to monetize. However, this aspect of our business would likely require significant capital and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from our present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that these initiatives would not yield any viable new inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss our investments in time and resources in such activities.\nIn addition, even if we are able to develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would heavily rely on, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:\n\u25cf patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u25cf we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u25cf any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u25cf we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf other companies may challenge patents issued to us;\n\u25cf other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and\n\u25cf enforcement of our patents may be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that it will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may license or otherwise monetize, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nChanges in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may increase our costs.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations, as well as those associated with being a public company. These rules and regulations may be changed by local, state, provincial, national or foreign governments or agencies. Such changes may result in significant increases in our compliance costs. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to our workforce, and could result in increased costs for services, compensation and benefits, and investment in new or upgraded equipment.\nDeclines in general economic conditions or acts of war and terrorism may adversely impact our business.\nDemand for printing services is typically correlated with general economic conditions. The prolonged decline in United States economic conditions associated with the great recession adversely impacted our business and results of operations and may do so again. The overall business climate of our industry may also be impacted by domestic and foreign wars or acts of terrorism, which events may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for our products and services.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American LLC Exchange, it may result in a delisting of our common stock from the exchange.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE American LLC Exchange (\u201cNYSE American\u201d), and the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards.\nIf our common stock were no longer listed on the NYSE American, investors might only be able to trade our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board \u00ae or in the Pink Sheets \u00ae (a quotation medium operated by Pink Sheets LLC). This would impair the liquidity of our common stock not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock may be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American, it could come within the definition of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and could be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nIf our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, compliance with applicable state securities laws may be required for certain offers, transfers and sales of the shares of our common stock.\nBecause our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are not required to register or qualify in any state the offer, transfer or sale of the common stock. If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, sales of stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants and transfers of the shares of our common stock sold by us in private placements to U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. In such event, it will be the responsibility of us in the case of warrant exercises or the holder of privately placed shares to register or qualify the shares for any offer, transfer or sale in the United States or to determine that any such offer, transfer or sale is exempt under applicable state securities laws.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited. Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of March 16, 2021, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 32.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, could have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As such, these stockholders, acting together, could have the ability to exert influence over the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by: \u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control; \u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or \u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nAdditional financing or future equity issuances may result in future dilution to our shareholders.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional funds in the future to finance our internal growth, our merger and acquisition plans, investment activities, continued research and product development, and for other reasons. Any required additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, you may experience significant dilution of your ownership interest and the newly issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The price per share at which we sell additional securities in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering. Alternatively, if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense. If adequate additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan.", "PERMNO": 10253, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "DSS"}
