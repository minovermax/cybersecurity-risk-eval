{"cik": "1178104", "company": "CARDICA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of net losses, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nWe have incurred annual net losses since our inception in October 1997. As of June 30, 2015, our accumulated deficit was approximately $189.7 million. We expect to incur substantial additional losses until we can achieve significant commercial sales of our products, which depend upon a number of factors, including increased commercial sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems, as well as increased sales of our commercially launched MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and in the United States.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends upon our ability to generate significantly higher product sales. Our ability to generate significant and sustained revenue depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nachievement of broad acceptance for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and in the United States, as well as any future products that we may commercialize;\n\u2022\nachievement of international and U.S. regulatory clearance or approval for additional products; and\n\u2022\nsuccessful sales, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products.\nHistorically, we have generated revenues primarily from the sale of automated anastomotic systems; however, we started generating revenues from the commercial sales of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 since its introduction in Europe in December 2012, and in the United States in March 2014, and through June 30, 2015, we have generated $1.4 million of net product revenues from the commercial sales of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. Sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems have not met the levels that we had anticipated, and to date our systems have had limited commercial adoption. Sales of our products, license and development and royalties activities generated revenues of $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.5 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not anticipate that we will generate significantly higher product sales in the next few quarters.\nOur cost of product sales was 145%, 136% and 117% of our net product sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect higher cost of product sales relative to revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future due to costs associated with commercializing our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 . If, over the long term, we are unable to reduce our cost of producing goods and expenses relative to our net revenue, we will not achieve profitability even if we are able to generate significant product sales. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nExisting lenders may have rights to our assets that are senior to our stockholders.\nAn existing debt arrangement with our current distributor and lender Century under which, as of June 30, 2015, $4.0 million of principal is outstanding, as well as potential future arrangements with other lenders, allow or may allow these lenders to have priority over our stockholders to our assets, including our intellectual property should we be in default of our obligations to the lenders. The proceeds of any sale or liquidation of our assets under these circumstances would be applied first to any of our debt obligations.\nOur quarterly operating results and stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. The revenue we generate, if any, and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our stock;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are able to raise additional capital in any equity or debt transaction;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and the United States once we execute the broader commercial launch;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 cartridge and stapler in Japan once Century commercializes it;\n\u2022\nthe extent of our ongoing enhancements of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, including alterations and post-commercialization improvements based on early adopter experience with this newly commercial product;\n\u2022\nthe extent of our ongoing research and development programs and related costs, including costs related to the development of additional products and features in our planned microcutter product line;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional license, development and/or collaboration agreements with respect to our technology, and the terms thereof;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance and adoption of future products that we may commercialize;\n\u2022\nour level of revenues;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our potential proxy contest with Broadfin Healthcare Master Fund, LTD, including costs associated with any potential litigation arising or resulting from the potential proxy contest;\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances and approvals for our products and potential additional products;\n\u2022\nsecuring, maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights and the costs thereof; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of competing technological and market developments.\nQuarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have temporarily suspended our controlled commercial launch of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device to focus on improving performance based on surgeon feedback, and if we are not able to improve performance then we may not be able to recommence commercial sales of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device.\nWe have expended significant time, money and effort in the development of our microcutter product line and, in particular, our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device, a device that will accommodate thicker tissue ranges requiring deployment of both white and blue cartridges, which we commercially launched in Europe in December 2012, and in the United States in March 2014 in a controlled commercial launch. In November 2014, we shifted our focus to improved performance of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device based on surgeon feedback, and temporarily suspended our controlled commercial launch and expect that we will need to continue to make enhancements and improvements to the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device. If we are not successful in improving the performance of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device to meet surgeon expectations and achieving market adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and the United States, we may never generate substantial revenue from this product line, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected, and we may be forced to cease operations.\nThe current unit costs for our products are very high, and if we are not able to bring them down we will suffer from price competition and may not become profitable.\nThe current unit costs for our products, based on limited manufacturing volumes, are very high and for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 are in excess of revenues per unit, and it will be necessary to achieve economies of scale to become profitable. Certain of our manufacturing processes are labor intensive, and achieving significant cost reductions will depend in part upon reducing the time required to complete these processes. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve cost reductions in the manufacture of our products and, without these cost reductions, our business may never achieve profitability.\nWe have considered, and will continue to consider as appropriate, manufacturing in-house certain components currently provided by third parties, as well as implementing new production processes. Manufacturing yields or costs may be adversely affected by the transition to in-house production or to new production processes, when and if these efforts are undertaken, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the commercial success of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and in the United States which, if not successful, could prevent us from successfully commercializing our other potential microcutter products.\nWe have expended significant time, money and effort in the development of our microcutter product line and, in particular, our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device. If we are not successful in improving the performance of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device and achieving market adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and the United States, we may never generate substantial revenue from this product line, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected, and we may be forced to cease operations. We anticipate that our ability to increase our revenue significantly will depend on the continued adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe, and adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in the United States, and our ability to expand our microcutter product line.\nA number of factors will influence our ability to gain clinical adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and any future microcutter products:\n\u25cf\nin many surgical specialties, the use of laparoscopic and open surgical stapling devices is routine in clinical practice and an accepted standard of care. Two large companies, Johnson & Johnson and Covidien, dominate the market for surgical stapling devices. For our products to be clinically adopted, they must show benefits that are significant enough for surgeons to communicate their preference and to overcome any constraints on their hospitals\u2019 ability to purchase competing products, such as purchasing contracts, to buy one of our stapling products to replace a competing device;\n\u25cf\nour microcutter products must demonstrate the degree of reliability that surgeons have experienced with products that they have been using for years;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our products also depends on our ability to demonstrate consistent quality and safety of our products;\n\u25cf\nif physicians are not able to use our microcutter products properly, or use them on tissue thicknesses for which they are not designed, adoption of our microcutter products may be negatively impacted;\n\u25cf\nany recalls may impact physicians\u2019 and hospitals\u2019 perception of our products;\n\u25cf\nwe will need to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products, including against branded, patent protected products, as well as any generic stapling products similar to currently commercially available products following expiration of patents on our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to reduce our costs of manufacturing the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30;\n\u25cf\nour ability to increase our sales force; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to address the need for improvements in response to feedback from physicians, if any.\nWe cannot predict when, if ever, we will generate significant commercial revenue from the sale of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 or any other potential future products or anticipated features in our microcutter product line. If we fail to achieve significant growth in market adoption of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, our ability to develop our other planned microcutter products, if at all, will be delayed, which would further harm our business.\nWe are dependent upon the success of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems to generate revenue in the near term, and sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems have not met the levels that we had anticipated and if we are unable to increase sales of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems, our business will be harmed.\nWe have expended significant time, money and effort in the development of our current commercial products used by cardiac surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery, the C-Port and the PAS-Port systems. We commenced sales of our C-Port xA system in December 2006 (after introduction of our original C-Port system in January 2006) and our C-Port Flex A in April 2007. We commenced U.S. sales of our PAS-Port system in September 2008. To date, our anastomosis products have not gained, and we cannot assure you that our anastomosis products or any other products that we may develop will gain, any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians or patients. We believe that recommendations by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products; however, we cannot assure you that significant recommendations will be obtained. Physicians will not recommend our products unless they conclude, based on clinical data and other factors, that the products represent a safe and acceptable alternative to other available options. In particular, physicians may elect not to recommend using our anastomosis products in surgical procedures until such time, if ever, as we successfully demonstrate with long-term data that our products result in patency rates comparable to or better than those achieved with hand-sewn anastomoses, and we resolve any technical limitations that may arise. Further, if physicians have negative experiences with our anastomosis products in surgical procedures, whether due to the fault of our anastomosis products or the physician, the adoption of these products could be negatively impacted.\nTo date we have generated revenues almost exclusively from the sale of automated anastomotic systems, and have generated minimal revenues from the commercial sales of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 since its December 2012 introduction in Europe and March 2014 introduction in the United States, following our FDA clearances for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 with blue staple cartridge in January 2014, and for the white staple cartridge in February 2014. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we eliminated eight sales representatives, three of whom were selling our automated anastomotic systems and five were selling our microcutter products. We will continue to sell our automated anastomotic systems internationally through distributors and plan to sell our automated anastomotic systems through independent sales representatives in the United States. We continue to only sell our microcutter products to a select number of key hospitals in the United States and through distributors in Europe before we commercially re-launch our improved MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. If we are not successful in increasing commercial adoption of our C-Port and PAS-Port systems, we may never generate substantial revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected, and we may be forced to cease operations.\nThe limitations on the indications of use for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 will limit our promotional activities, which could inhibit our success in commercializing the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and could expose us to potential off-label risks, including fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of the off-label use of our products. Healthcare providers may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nWe have limited clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. Any data that is generated in the future may not be positive or consistent with our existing data, which would affect market acceptance and the rate at which the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, and any future microcutter products, are adopted.\nThe success of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and any future microcutter products depends on their acceptance by the surgical community as safe and effective. Even if the data collected from future clinical studies or clinical experience indicates positive results, each surgeon\u2019s actual experience with our devices outside the clinical study setting may vary. Clinical studies conducted with our initial microcutter products may involve procedures performed by thoracic, bariatric, colorectal and general surgeons who are technically proficient, high-volume surgeons. Consequently, both short- and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results of practicing surgeons, which could negatively impact rates of adoption of the microcutter if launched. In addition, any adverse experiences of surgeons using the microcutter products, or adverse outcomes to patients, may deter surgeons from using our products and negatively impact product adoption.\nIf the FDA determines that our C-Port systems or PAS-Port systems do not perform as anticipated, or if the FDA identifies new concerns related to the safety and effectiveness of these products, we may be required to withdraw these products, which could harm our business.\nAs a condition of its U.S market clearance, the C-Port system is subject to a mandatory Post Market Surveillance order under Section 522 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (which we refer to as the 522 order) to demonstrate graft patency outcomes and technical failure rate in a clinical study. Should the FDA decide that the C-Port system does not perform as anticipated, or if the FDA identifies new concerns related to the safety and effectiveness of the product, or if the FDA determines that the requirements of the 522 order are otherwise unmet, we may be required to withdraw the C-Port system from the market and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could harm our business.\nOur C-Port and PAS-Port systems were designed for use with venous grafts. In addition, we have studied the use of the C-Port systems with venous grafts and arterial grafts. Using the C-Port systems with arterial grafts may not yield patency rates or material adverse cardiac event rates comparable to those found in our clinical trials using venous grafts, which could negatively affect market acceptance of our C-Port systems. In addition, the clips and staples deployed by our products are made of 316L medical-grade stainless steel, to which some patients are allergic. These allergies, especially if not previously diagnosed or unknown, may result in adverse reactions that negatively affect the patency of the anastomoses or the healing of the implants and may therefore adversely affect outcomes, particularly when compared to anastomoses performed with other materials, such as sutures. Additionally, in the event a surgeon, during the course of surgery, determines that it is necessary to convert to a hand-sewn anastomosis and to remove an anastomosis created by one of our products, the removal of the implants may result in more damage to the target vessel (such as the aorta or coronary artery) than would typically be encountered during removal of a hand-sewn anastomosis. Moreover, the removal may damage the target vessel to an extent that could further complicate construction of a replacement hand-sewn or automated anastomosis, which could be detrimental to patient outcome. These or other issues, if experienced, could limit physician adoption of our products.\nEven if the data collected from future clinical studies or clinical experience indicates positive results, each physician\u2019s actual experience with our devices outside the clinical study setting may vary. Clinical studies conducted with the C-Port and PAS-Port systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are technically proficient, high-volume users of the C-Port and PAS-Port systems. Consequently, both short- and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results of practicing physicians, which could negatively impact rates of adoption of the C-Port and PAS-Port systems.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to market and sell our products, our business may be harmed.\nWe have limited experience as a company in the sale, marketing and distribution of our products. To commercialize the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in the United States, we will have to improve performance of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device based on surgeon feedback and build a sales force. Century is responsible for marketing and commercialization of cardiac and microcutter products in Japan. To promote our current and future products in the United States, Canada and Europe, we must develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. Developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. We may be unable to establish and manage an effective sales force in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all, and any sales force we do establish may not be capable of generating sufficient demand for our products. We have entered into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, which may result in lower product sales than if we directly marketed and sold our products. We expect to rely on third-party distributors or independent sales representatives for substantially all of our sales. If we are unable to establish adequate sales and marketing capabilities, independently or with others, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and may not become profitable.\nOur products require training to use, and if physicians are not willing to undergo that training, or if they undergo the training but do not use our products properly, or for other reasons, our products may not gain any significant degree of market acceptance, and a lack of market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWidespread use of our products will require the training of numerous physicians, and the time required to complete training could result in a delay or dampening of market acceptance. Even if the safety and efficacy of our products is established, physicians may use our products improperly due to unfamiliarity with the products, or may use the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 on tissues with thicknesses greater than the specifications for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. If this were to happen, the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 may not function as desired for the physicians and could be reported as a problem with the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 rather than the physicians using it improperly, which could damage the reputation of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and cause other physicians to consider the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 to be not a safe product. Further, physicians may elect not to use our products for a number of other reasons beyond our control, including inadequate or no reimbursement from health care payors, physicians\u2019 reluctance to use products that have not been proven through time in the market, the introduction of competing devices by our competitors and pricing for our products. Failure of our products to achieve any significant market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to improve and expand our product portfolio, and our failure to do so could cause our business and prospects to suffer.\nWhile we continue to improve performance of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 combo device based on surgeon feedback and make modifications and add features to our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, we have suspended development of other potential products in our planned microcutter product line until the development and commercialization of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 have been completed. Significant additional research and development and financial resources will be required to continue the development of the other products in our planned product line into commercially viable products and to obtain necessary regulatory clearances to commercialize the devices. We cannot assure you that our development efforts will be successful or that they will be completed within our publicly stated anticipated timelines, and we may never be successful in developing a viable product for the markets intended to be addressed by our other potential microcutter products. Further, even if we do successfully develop any of these microcutter products, we may not be successful in commercializing them for any number of reasons, including failure or delays in obtaining regulatory clearances, or if surgeons do not perceive the benefits of these products to be significantly greater than current established products. We may also face additional competition from branded, patent-protected products, as well as generic stapling products similar to currently commercially available products following expiration of patents on our competitors\u2019 products, which could create greater price competition and decrease the revenue potential of our microcutter products. Our failure to successfully develop our other microcutter products and improvements to our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 would have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and ability to raise additional capital.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products.\nThe pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging as a result of any of one several possible regulatory developments, including policies advanced by the United States government, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. The U.S. government has shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare \u201creform\u201d and reducing healthcare costs. For example, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, were implemented starting in 2013. Any government-adopted reform measures that decrease the amount of reimbursement available from governmental and other third-party payers, and could potentially adversely affect our business.\nOur PAS-Port and C-Port systems, our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, and future products may face future development and regulatory difficulties and limitations on use.\nEven though the current generations of the C-Port and PAS-Port systems have received U.S. regulatory clearance, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of these products or ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-clearance studies. The FDA permits commercial distribution of most new medical devices only after the device has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved PMA. Any of our future products, including planned products in our microcutter product line and any future generations of the C-Port and PAS-Port systems, may not obtain regulatory clearances required for marketing or may face these types of restrictions or requirements, particularly as the FDA is considering revising its 510(k) clearance system to, in certain cases, require human clinical data and to prohibit the combination of multiple predicate devices as the basis for a 510(k).\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We rely substantially on the premarket notification process for FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This provision allows many medical devices to avoid human clinical trials if the product is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to another device already on the market. Premarket notification requires a new device to be compared for safety, effectiveness and technological characteristics to another device (or multiple devices) already on the market. A successful 510(k) submission results in FDA clearance for commercialization. If we can no longer use the 510(k) pathway in the future, we may be required to perform clinical trials for our new products in order to obtain clearance or approval for commercialization. If so, our development costs will increase substantially, and the likelihood of approval for some of our products may be reduced. The PMA approval process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and requires the development and submission of clinical studies supporting the safety and effectiveness of the device. Product modifications may also require the submission of a new 510(k) clearance or the approval of a PMA before the modified product can be marketed. Any products or product enhancements that we develop that require regulatory clearance or approval may not be cleared or approved on the timelines that we currently anticipate, if approved at all. Any new products or any product enhancements that we develop may not be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, but may instead be subject to the more lengthy PMA requirements. Additionally, even if 510(k) or other regulatory clearance is granted for any potential product, the approved indications for use may be limited, and the FDA may require additional animal or human clinical data prior to any potential approval of additional indications.\nThe European Union, or EU, requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the CE Mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the EU. We have received CE Mark certification for the two initial microcutter surgical cutting and stapling devices that we have developed, the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and the MicroCutter XPRESS 30. To maintain authorization to apply the CE Mark to future devices within the microcutter product line, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. If we modify the intended use of new products (relative to predicate products) or change the indication for use or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for permission to affix the CE Mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain permission to affix the CE Mark to new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorization that we have received. If we are unable to maintain authorization to affix the CE Mark to microcutter products, we will not be able to sell these products in member countries of the EU, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulatory agencies subject a product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review, regulation and periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, our collaborators or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. Our products will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information on the product. If our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may impose any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nwarning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\ndelay in processing marketing applications for new products or modifications to existing products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nTo market any products internationally, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance or approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA clearance or approval, including the risk that our products may not be approved for use under all of the circumstances requested, which could limit the uses of our products and adversely impact potential product sales, and that such clearance or approval may require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we may estimate and publicly announce the timing anticipated for the accomplishment of various clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include submissions for and receipt of clearances or approvals from regulatory authorities, other clinical and regulatory events or the launch of new products. These estimates are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur manufacturing facilities, and those of our suppliers, must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure of our manufacturing facilities to comply with quality requirements would harm our business and our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic inspections and audits by various federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, our facilities have been inspected by State of California regulatory authorities pursuant to granting a California Device Manufacturing License and by the FDA. Additionally, to market products in Europe, we are required to maintain International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certification and are subject to periodic surveillance audits. We are currently ISO 13485:2003 certified; however, our failure to maintain necessary regulatory compliance and permits for our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing processes and, in some cases, those of our suppliers, are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products, including the PAS-Port and C-Port systems and the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In addition, we must engage in extensive record keeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we are given notice of significant violations in a QSR inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of product distribution or other operating restrictions, seizures or recalls of our devices and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nWe may also be required to recall our products due to manufacturing supply defects. If we issue recalls of our products in the future, our revenue and business could be harmed.\nLack of third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products could delay or limit their adoption.\nWe may experience limited sales growth resulting from limitations on reimbursements made to purchasers of our products by third-party payors, and we cannot assure you that our sales will not be impeded and our business harmed if third-party payors fail to provide reimbursement that hospitals view as adequate.\nIn the United States, our products are and will continue to be purchased primarily by medical institutions, which then bill various third-party payors, such as CMS which administer the Medicare program, and other government programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. The process involved in applying for coverage and incremental reimbursement from CMS is lengthy and expensive. Under current CMS reimbursement policies, CMS offers a process to obtain add-on payment for a new medical technology when the existing Diagnosis-Related Group, or DRG, prospective payment rate is inadequate. To obtain add-on payment, a technology must be considered \u201cnew,\u201d demonstrate substantial improvement in care and exceed certain payment thresholds. Add-on payments are made for no less than two years and no more than three years. We must demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our technology to the FDA in addition to CMS requirements before add-on payments can be made. Further, Medicare coverage is based on our ability to demonstrate the treatment is \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for Medicare beneficiaries. In November 2006, CMS denied our request for an add-on payment with respect to our C-Port systems. According to CMS, we met the \u201cnew\u201d criteria and exceeded the payment threshold but did not in their view demonstrate substantial improvement in care. Even if our products receive FDA and other regulatory clearance or approval, they may not be granted coverage and reimbursement in the foreseeable future, if at all. Moreover, many private payors look to CMS in setting their reimbursement policies and amounts. If CMS or other agencies limit coverage or decrease or limit reimbursement payments for doctors and hospitals, this may affect coverage and reimbursement determinations by many private payors.\nWe cannot assure you that CMS will provide coverage and reimbursement for our products. If a medical device does not receive incremental reimbursement from CMS, then a medical institution would have to absorb the cost of our products as part of the cost of the procedure in which the products are used. Acute care hospitals are now generally reimbursed by CMS for inpatient operating costs under a Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system. Under the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system, acute care hospitals receive a fixed payment amount for each covered hospitalized patient based upon the DRG to which the inpatient stay is assigned, regardless of the actual cost of the services provided. At this time, we do not know the extent to which medical institutions would consider insurers\u2019 payment levels adequate to cover the cost of our products. Failure by hospitals and physicians to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our products are used could deter them from purchasing our products and limit our revenue growth. In addition, pre-determined DRG payments may decline over time, which could deter medical institutions from purchasing our products. If medical institutions are unable to justify the costs of our products, they may refuse to purchase them, which would significantly harm our business.\nAny clinical trials that we may conduct may not begin on time, or at all, and may not be completed on schedule, or at all.\nThe commencement or completion of any clinical trials that we may conduct may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or place on hold a clinical trial, or do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe data and safety monitoring committee of a clinical trial recommends that a trial be placed on hold or suspended;\n\u2022\npatients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\npatients are not followed-up at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites decide not to participate or cease participation in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\npatients experience adverse side effects or events related to our products;\n\u2022\npatients die or suffer adverse medical effects during a clinical trial for a variety of reasons, which may not be related to our product candidates, including the advanced stage of their disease and other medical problems;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials if investigators find us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthird-party suppliers fail to provide us with critical components that conform to design and performance specifications;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our manufacturing processes to produce finished products that conform to design and performance specifications;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u2022\nthe interim results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or negative;\n\u2022\npre-clinical or clinical data is interpreted by third parties in different ways; or\n\u2022\nour trial design, although approved, is inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy.\nClinical trials sometimes experience delays related to outcomes experienced during the course of the trials, which may result in a material delay in the trial and could lead to more significant delays or other effects in future trials. Clinical trials may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient follow-up in clinical trials depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, or they may be persuaded to participate in contemporaneous trials of competitive products. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may cause an increase in costs and delays or result in the failure of the trial.\nOur clinical trial costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to repeat a trial, terminate a trial or cancel an entire program.\nIf the third parties upon which we rely to conduct our clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials. In addition, we rely on third parties to assist with our pre-clinical development of product candidates. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control, such as changes in regulations, delays in enrollment, and the like. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any clinical trials that we may conduct may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all.\nBecause two customers account for a substantial portion of our product sales, the loss of these significant customers would cause a substantial decline in our revenue.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to Century, our distributor in Japan, and to Herz-Und Diabeteszentrum in Germany. The loss of either of these customers would cause a decrease in revenue and, consequently, an increase in net loss. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, sales to Century accounted for approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, and sales to Herz-Und Diabeteszentrum accounted for approximately 10% and 12%, respectively, of our total product sales. We expect these customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the near term. As a result, if we lose these customers, our revenue and net loss would be adversely affected. In addition, customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not generate revenue in any future period. The failure to obtain new significant customers or additional orders from existing customers will materially affect our operating results.\nWe may require substantial additional capital to continue operations as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had approximately $21.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $4.0 million in long-term investments and $4.0 million of debt principal outstanding. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted for at least the next 12 months. We may be able to extend this time period to the extent that we decrease our planned expenditures, or raise additional capital. We have based our estimate as to the sufficiency of our cash resources on assumptions that may prove to be wrong.\nBecause we do not anticipate that we will generate sufficient product sales to achieve profitability for the next several years, if at all, we may need to raise substantial additional capital to finance our operations in the future. To raise capital, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain a credit facility or enter into product development, license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our commercialized products or products in development. However, we cannot be certain that additional funding of any kind will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our Series A preferred stock and common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any product development, licensing, distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights, including with respect to commercialized products or products in development that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner. Our need to raise capital may require us to accept terms that may harm our business or be disadvantageous to our current stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or revenue from product sales do not increase, we would be required to further reduce our workforce, delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts with respect to one or more of our products or one or more of our research and development programs. Failure to raise additional capital may result in our ceasing to be publicly traded or ceasing operations.\nIf our competitors for our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 have products that are marketed more effectively or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunity for our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and any future microcutter products will be reduced or eliminated and our business will be harmed.\nAlthough we have commercially launched the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 in Europe and in the United States, we have generated minimal revenues from this launch through June 30, 2015. We only received the FDA 510(k) clearances for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 and blue staple cartridge in January 2014, and for the white staple cartridge in February 2014, for use in multiple open or minimally-invasive surgical procedures for the transection, resection and/or creation of anastomoses in the small and large intestine, as well as the transection of the appendix. To further expand the use of the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, we submitted a 510(k) Premarket Notification to the FDA in April 2015, to expand the indications for use to include vascular structures. We have not yet received FDA clearance for this 510(k) submission. The MicroCutter XCHANGE 30 competes, and the MicroCutter XCHANGE 45 and other planned improvements, features and products in the microcutter product line if they receive regulatory clearance and are successfully launched, would compete in the market for stapling and cutting devices against laparoscopic stapling and sealing devices currently marketed around the world. We believe the principal competitive factors in the market for laparoscopic staplers include:\n\u2022\nreduced product size;\n\u2022\nease of use;\n\u2022\nproduct quality and reliability;\n\u2022\ndevice cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\ndegree of articulation;\n\u2022\nsurgeon relationships; and\n\u2022\nsales and marketing capabilities.\nTwo large competitors, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, part of Johnson & Johnson, and Covidien currently control over 80% of this market. Other large competitors in the laparoscopic device market include Stryker Endoscopy and Olympus, which acquired another competitor, Gyrus Medical. Ethicon Endo-Surgery and Covidien, which acquired a small competitor, Power Medical, each have large direct sales forces in the United States and have been the largest participants in the market for single use disposable laparoscopic stapling devices for many years. Competing against large established competitors with significant resources may make establishing a market for any products that we develop difficult which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A private company, JustRight Surgical, LLC, is developing smaller surgical instruments and has announced FDA 510(k) clearance for a 5 millimeter stapler that could be considered competitive with our stapling products, but is more limited in availability of staple sizes and articulation compared to the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. Further, we may also face additional competition from generic surgical stapling products similar to currently commercially available products following expiration of patents on our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf our competitors for our anastomotic solutions and cardiac bypass products have products that are approved in advance of ours, are marketed more effectively or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunity for our anastomotic solutions and cardiac bypass products will be reduced or eliminated and our business will be harmed.\nThe market for anastomotic solutions and cardiac bypass products is competitive. Competitors include a variety of public and private companies that currently offer or are developing cardiac surgery products generally and automated anastomotic systems specifically that would compete directly with ours.\nWe believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for medical devices used in the treatment of coronary artery disease include:\n\u2022\nimproved patient outcomes;\n\u2022\naccess to and acceptance by leading physicians;\n\u2022\nproduct quality and reliability;\n\u2022\nease of use;\n\u2022\ndevice cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\ntraining and support;\n\u2022\nnovelty;\n\u2022\nphysician relationships; and\n\u2022\nsales and marketing capabilities.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully on the basis of any one or more of these factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of different technologies exist or are under development for performing anastomoses, including sutures, mechanical anastomotic devices, suture-based anastomotic devices and shunting devices. Currently, substantially all anastomoses are performed with sutures and, for the foreseeable future we believe that sutures will continue to be the principal alternative to our anastomotic products. Sutures are far less expensive than our automated anastomotic products, and other anastomotic devices may be less expensive than our own. Surgeons, who have been using sutures for their entire careers, may be reluctant to consider alternative technologies, despite potential advantages. Any resistance to change among practitioners could delay or hinder market acceptance of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCardiovascular diseases may also be treated by other methods that do not require anastomoses, including, interventional techniques such as balloon angioplasty with or without the use of stents, pharmaceuticals, atherectomy catheters and lasers. Several of these alternative treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. In addition, technological advances with other therapies for cardiovascular disease, such as drugs, or future innovations in cardiac surgery techniques could make other methods of treating these diseases more effective or lower cost than bypass procedures. For example, the number of bypass procedures in the United States and other major markets has declined in recent years and is expected to decline in the years ahead because competing treatments are, in many cases, far less invasive and provide acceptable clinical outcomes. Many companies working on treatments that do not require anastomoses may have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and technical resources and experience than we have. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and therapies that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining clearance or approval from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do for ours. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.\nWe are dependent upon a number of key suppliers, including single source suppliers, the loss of which would materially harm our business.\nWe use or rely upon sole source suppliers for certain components and services used in manufacturing our products, and we utilize materials and components supplied by third parties with which we do not have any long-term contracts. Many suppliers have ceased supplying materials for use in implantable medical devices. We cannot assure you that materials required by us will not be restricted or that we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of such materials or services in the future. Moreover, the continued use by us of materials manufactured by third parties could subject us to liability exposure. Because we do not have long-term contracts, none of our suppliers is required to provide us with any guaranteed minimum production levels.\nWe cannot quickly replace suppliers or establish additional new suppliers for some of our components, particularly due to both the complex nature of the manufacturing process used by our suppliers and the time and effort that may be required to obtain FDA clearance or approval or other regulatory approval to use materials from alternative suppliers. Any significant supply interruption or capacity constraints affecting our facilities or those of our suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products and, therefore, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience and may encounter difficulties in increasing production to provide an adequate supply to customers.\nTo date, our manufacturing activities have consisted primarily of producing moderate quantities of our products for use in clinical studies and for commercial sales in Japan, Europe and the United States. Production in increased commercial quantities will require us to expand our manufacturing capabilities and to hire and train additional personnel. We may encounter difficulties in increasing our manufacturing capacity and in manufacturing larger commercial quantities, including:\n\u2022\nmaintaining product yields;\n\u2022\nmaintaining quality control and assurance;\n\u2022\nproviding component and service availability;\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate control policies and procedures; and\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nDifficulties encountered in increasing our manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of our products is a complex and costly operation involving a number of separate processes and components. Any shipment delays could harm perception of our products and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. We may become a party to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming. Additionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel.\nWhile we are not aware of any patents issued to third parties that contain subject matter materially related to our technology, there may be patents held by third parties of which we are not aware that contain subject matter materially related to our technology. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert that our products and systems infringe the claims in their patents or seek to expand their patent claims to cover aspects of our products and systems. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may be required to redesign our products to avoid infringement, and it may not be possible to do so effectively. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling the C-Port or PAS-Port systems or any other product we may develop, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nWe rely upon patents, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. Our pending patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we have obtained or will obtain in the future might be invalidated or circumvented by third parties. If any challenges are successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent that our intellectual property protection is inadequate, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. In addition, competitors could purchase any of our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and that all inventions arising out of the individual\u2019s relationship with us shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nOur products face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new, less invasive surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current procedures that use or could use our products. Accordingly, our success will depend in part upon our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products. We expect the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance or approval processes, train physicians in the use of our products, and supply commercial quantities of products to the market to be important competitive factors. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and we cannot assure you that our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products. We have experienced delays in completing the development and commercialization of our planned products, and there can be no assurance that these delays will not continue or recur in the future. Any delays could result in a loss of market acceptance and market share.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur operations may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with physicians, including consulting arrangements, as well as proposed sales, marketing and educational activities. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the US states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nfederal criminal statutes created under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u25cf\nfederal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u25cf\nstate and federal marketing expenditure tracking and reporting laws, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the United States to be tracked and reported (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities).\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims, which could be time consuming and costly to defend, divert management attention, and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage. The expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for our company or our customers could adversely affect our ability to sell our products, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing, and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us. Additionally, we are currently training physicians in the United States on the use of our blue and white staple cartridges for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, C-Port and PAS-Port systems and in Europe for the MicroCutter XCHANGE 30. During training, patients may be harmed, which could also lead to product liability claims. Product liability claims or other claims related to our products, or their off-label use, regardless of their merits or outcomes, could harm our reputation in the industry, reduce our product sales, lead to significant legal fees, and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to fully cover the costs of any claim or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nSome of our customers and prospective customers may have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operations and use of the C-Port or PAS-Port systems or the microcutter product line. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using the C-Port or PAS-Port systems and potential customers may opt against purchasing the C-Port or PAS-Port systems due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage.\nWe sell our systems internationally and are subject to various risks relating to these international activities, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nTo date, a substantial portion of our product sales has been attributable to sales in international markets. By doing business in international markets, we are exposed to risks separate and distinct from those we face in our domestic operations. Our international business may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions in foreign countries. Because most of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our products could become more costly to the international customer and, therefore, less competitive in international markets, which could affect our results of operations. Engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nexport restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n\u2022\nthe availability and level of reimbursement within prevailing foreign healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with existing and changing foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ninternational terrorism and anti-American sentiment;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing any foreign operations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights.\nOur exposure to each of these risks may increase our costs, impair our ability to market and sell our products and require significant management attention. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business.\nOur operations are currently conducted at a single location that may be at risk from earthquakes, terror attacks or other disasters.\nWe currently conduct all of our manufacturing, development and management activities at a single location in Redwood City, California, near known earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of computer data. However, any future natural disaster, such as an earthquake, or a terrorist attack, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory and cause us to incur additional expenses. A disaster could seriously harm our business and results of operations. Our insurance does not cover earthquakes and floods and may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. We do not carry specific hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory clearances or approvals could be suspended or terminated.\nChanges in tax structures may negatively impact our financial results and industry in general, which could harm our business and the value of our stock.\nEffective January 1, 2013, U.S. health care law reforms under the 2010 Affordable Care Act imposed a new 2.3% excise tax on certain medical technology companies regardless of whether the companies are profitable. Industry advocates anticipate the new tax will negatively impact innovation and U.S. competitiveness. The tax may already be having an adverse impact on U.S. medical device research and development investment activity and job creation, and may force affected companies to consider cutting manufacturing operations, research and development, and employment levels. These new taxes may also adversely impact patient access to new and innovative medical technologies such as those we manufacture and develop. If any of these risks materialize, then our business may be harmed and the value of our common stock could decline. We cannot assure you that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. If we undergo such an ownership change, the limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before we can use them, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future offerings of our stock and other subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn December 9, 2014, we received notice from the NASDAQ Global Market that we did not meet the continued listing requirements for listing our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market because for 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share. In June 2015, we transferred the listing of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market. We have until December 7, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the NASDAQ staff may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) before December 7, 2015. If we are not able to achieve compliance by December 7, 2015, we will need to cure the deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split. However, if it appears to the NASDAQ staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we do not meet the other listing standards, NASDAQ could provide notice that our common stock will become subject to delisting. We cannot guarantee that our stock price will meet the listing requirements and therefore our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nThe conversion of shares of Series A preferred stock into common stock, or the perception that such conversions may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe currently have 191,474 shares of our Series A preferred stock outstanding. Each share of our Series A preferred stock is convertible into 100 shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder, subject to certain limitations. The conversion of substantial amounts of our Series A preferred stock would result in the issuance by us of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, which, subject to certain limitations, could be traded publicly. Such conversions, or the perception that such conversions may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nAn active and liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncompletion of development and commercial launch of our microcutter products, and the timing thereof;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market;\n\u2022\nperceptions that we may not be able to raise capital as needed, or that investors will be substantially diluted if we do raise capital;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance and adoption of our products;\n\u2022\nregulatory clearance or approvals of or other regulatory developments with respect to our products;\n\u2022\nvolume and timing of orders for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our industry; and\n\u2022\nactions by stockholder activists.\nIn addition, the stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and your interests may conflict with the interests of our existing stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates, together with other stockholders that own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, beneficially owned approximately 42% of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2015. In addition, two stockholders collectively hold all of our Series A preferred stock and may convert those shares into 19,147,400 shares of our common stock and, if they were to convert all of the shares of our Series A preferred stock, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates, together with other stockholders that own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, would beneficially own approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these stockholders may be different than the interests of other stockholders on these matters. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.\nEvolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and The NASDAQ Stock Market rules are creating uncertainty for public companies. We are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional compliance costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by courts and regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Maintaining appropriate standards of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from product-generating and revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and reputation may be harmed.\nOur future operating results may be below securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nThe revenue and income potential of our products and our business model are unproven, and we may be unable to generate significant revenue or grow at the rate expected by securities analysts or investors. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts or investors expect. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our common stock price to decline. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe broad commercial launch of our MicroCutter XCHANGE 30, and the timing thereof;\n\u2022\ncompletion of development and commercial launch of our other microcutter products, and the timing thereof;\n\u2022\nFDA or other regulatory clearance or approval of our products;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe performance of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and protect proprietary rights.\nOur operating results in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock will likely decline.\nAnti-takeover defenses that we have in place could prevent or frustrate attempts to change our direction or management.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide our board of directors with the ability to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock market in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, the market prices of securities of medical device companies have been particularly volatile. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain to our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nThe announcement by a dissident stockholder of an intention to conduct a proxy contest has the potential to adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nBroadfin Healthcare Master Fund, LTD, or Broadfin, has announced its intention to initiate a proxy contest with respect to the election of directors at our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, or the Annual Meeting. Broadfin is proposing to solicit proxies for the purpose of voting in favor of its eight nominees for election to our board of directors, including three of our current board members. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be harmed by the potential proxy contest because, among other things:\n\u2022\nresponding to the potential proxy contest is costly and time-consuming, is a significant distraction for our board of directors, management and employees, and diverts the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors, may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential future customers and suppliers, and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n\u2022\nthe expenses for legal and advisory fees and administrative and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to the potential proxy contest and any related litigation may be substantial; and\n\u2022\nwe may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the potential proxy contest or matters arising from the potential proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors, management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above, the outcome of the potential proxy contest, or a threat of future stockholder activism.", "PERMNO": 91088, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "DXTRQ"}
