RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry and Operating Risks\nGlobal health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, are adversely impacting and could continue to adversely impact our financial and operational performance.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been and are being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to directly and indirectly respond to and limit the spread, variants and resurgences of COVID-19 have had, are having and could continue to have certain impacts on our financial and operational performance, including the following:\n\u2022We have experienced, and could continue to experience, shifts in consumption of our foodservice and certain on-the-go products due to reduced consumer traffic in restaurants, schools and other locations resulting from permanent and temporary customer closures, shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations, reduced capacity at these venues, including as a result of social distancing or labor shortages at our customers, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to these food consumption shifts, during fiscal 2020, we temporarily idled certain of our facilities and delivered contract suspension notices to certain of our suppliers, invoking force majeure clauses, which have since been provisionally lifted, and we could become a party to litigation to enforce these force majeure clauses or otherwise enforce our rights under the Uniform Commercial Code. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists or intensifies, the negative impacts on consumption of our foodservice or on-the-go products could recur, be more prolonged or may become more severe, and we may in the future need to take similar or more aggressive actions.\n\u2022We have experienced, and we expect that we will continue to experience, temporary workforce or other disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including continued employee absenteeism and labor shortages, which have negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact our ability to manufacture and deliver our products. We have implemented employee safety measures at our manufacturing facilities, but these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees or protect against other impacts resulting from COVID-19. We have had, and expect to continue to have future needs, to temporarily close individual production lines or entire manufacturing facilities either due to a widespread employee outbreak, sanitizings or related operational interruptions, due to labor shortages or for other reasons related to COVID-19 and have had to, and expect to have future needs to, place one or more of our products on allocation.\n\u2022The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the operations of third parties in our supply chain has included, and we expect in the future will include, failure of third parties on which we rely to meet their obligations to us or disruptions in their ability to do so, increases in the cost, or reductions in, the availability and timely delivery of ingredients, packaging and other materials used to manufacture our products, operational delays, increases in the cost of freight, lack of adequate manufacturing capacity and delays in repairs at our facilities and has resulted in, and we expect will result in additional, interruptions in our supply chain.\n\u2022We have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating costs, including facility reconfiguration costs to enhance social distancing, purchases of equipment and supplies that are in high demand, costs to engage third party resources and costs for facility sanitizings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving understanding of the science and best practices. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional expenses to comply with new requirements imposed by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency temporary standard on November 5, 2021 (the \u201cETS\u201d) requiring certain employers, including us, to comply with a vaccine mandate, which could negatively impact our and our supply chain\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, increase costs and administrative burden and result in fines if we cannot comply, any of which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter (such as occurred for certain of our retail products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and continued through the first half of fiscal 2021), which in certain cases exceeded, and could in the future exceed, our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain and resulted in, and could in the future result in, one or more of our products being placed on allocation. Further, while we experienced increased demand for certain of our retail products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 that continued through the first half of fiscal 2021, demand for such products generally returned\nto a growth rate in line with pre-pandemic levels during the second half of fiscal 2021 as consumers responded to changes in restrictions on mobility. Consumer perceptions of our Company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and any perceived quality or health concerns (whether or not valid) regarding our products, could affect our brand value.\n\u2022Significant policy changes in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import or export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions or unemployment or other benefits) could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Deteriorating economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic slowdowns or recessions or significant disruptions or volatility in financial markets, could limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations or impact the cost or availability of additional capital.\n\u2022Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.\n\u2022Continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on planned timelines.\nThese and other impacts have caused, and may continue to cause, an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that have been and may continue to be material. In addition, such impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened, or in some cases manifested, other risks set forth below, any of which could have a material effect on us. Although restrictions on mobility have been reduced or in some cases lifted, COVID-19 continues, and we expect will continue, to impact our businesses. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of as of the date hereof. The extent and potential short and long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could be material, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of COVID-19, actions that have and may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines, changing consumer behaviors and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets, all of which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nDisruption of our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in weather conditions, could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, third party manufacturers and distributors, our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, governmental restrictions or mandates (including COVID-19 testing and vaccine mandates, such as the ETS), labor shortages, border closures, weather conditions, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disasters, agricultural diseases, fires or evacuations related thereto, explosions, cyber incidents, terrorism, strikes or other labor unrest, repairs or enhancements at facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. Competitors can be affected differently by any of these events depending on a number of factors, including the location of their suppliers and operations. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a commodity or raw material is sourced from or a product is manufactured at a single location, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nAs previously discussed, during fiscal 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our operations, including temporary workforce disruptions, labor shortages and other disruptions in our supply chain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for certain of our products has in certain cases exceeded our production capacity and we expect will continue to do so in the future or otherwise strain our supply chain. In some instances, we have placed certain of our products on allocation. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our supply chain and operations; however, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, variants of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, including vaccine mandates such as the ETS, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines and changes in consumer behaviors.\nWe are currently dependent upon third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many of our products. Our businesses could suffer as a result of a third party\u2019s inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications.\nOur businesses rely on independent third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many products, such as RTD protein shakes, protein bars and powders, nutritional supplements, breakfast drinks, certain cereal and granola products, certain snack products, shell eggs, egg products, dairy products, potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and certain refrigerated food\nproducts. Our businesses could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third parties, such as increases in costs, delays in the addition of incremental capacity, reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, errors in complying with specifications, insufficient quality control and failures to meet production or shipment deadlines, including as a result of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases and related governmental restrictions or mandates, including COIVD-19 testing and vaccine mandates such as the ETS. The inability of a third party supplier or manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.\nCertain of our relationships with these third party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product and the third party supplier has committed to provide, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of materials, respectively. Despite these commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such third parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under our agreements or cannot produce or supply, as applicable, adequate amounts to allow us to meet customer demands. For example, due to a combination of better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the second half of fiscal 2018 and, along with Dymatize powders, in the second half of fiscal 2021, each of which we expect to continue into fiscal 2022, delays in planned incremental production capacity by our third party contract manufacturer network and (in the case of Dymatize powders) whey protein availability, customer demand for Premier Protein RTD shakes exceeded and we expect to continue to exceed available production capacity and resulted in inventory of our Premier Protein RTD shakes below acceptable levels at September 30, 2018 and Premier Protein RTD shakes and Dymatize powders inventories below acceptable levels at September 30, 2021, respectively. Alternately, we could incur penalties if we do not purchase the minimum quantities provided under these commitments. In addition, certain of our relationships with these third party manufacturers and suppliers are not subject to supply commitments, and we may not be able to obtain such commitments in a timely manner or at all. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our third party manufacturers\u2019 operations combined with a lack of contractual commitments has resulted in and continues to result in shortages in certain of our Crystal Farms products.\nIncreased input costs, including costs for freight, raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur freight costs have increased and may continue to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. The primary ingredients used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit and nuts. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments\u2019 operating results are significantly affected by egg, sow, potato and cheese prices and the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are the primary grains fed to laying hens. Our primary packaging materials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, propane, electricity, carbon dioxide, sanitizing supplies and personal protective equipment. The supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, labor shortages, animal feed costs, weather conditions, natural disasters, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, inflation, increased demand, diseases affecting livestock (such as the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak and the 2015 avian influenza outbreak) and milk price supports established by the USDA. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs.\nHistorically, the prices of certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our businesses have fluctuated widely and this volatility has been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have experienced and expect in the future to experience shortages of certain of our raw materials, which result in us paying increased costs for such inputs and impact our ability to produce our products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs, including costs for facility reconfigurations to enhance social distancing, personal protective equipment, employee health screenings, compliance with applicable government vaccine mandates such as the ETS and facility sanitizings and to secure sources of alternate supply for certain inputs.\nThe prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our input costs at the time they occur or at all. Accordingly, changes in input costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors\u2019 costs, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, when we have experienced shortages of the inputs necessary for our manufacturing\nprocesses, which occur from time to time, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and may in the future be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, temporary workforce disruptions or the inability of our employees to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19) or based upon shelter in place or other restrictions put in place by governmental authorities, could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to operate and expand our businesses. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our businesses, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our businesses have experienced and we expect to continue to experience labor shortages, resulting in our inability to meet consumer demand for certain of our products, which have negatively impacted, and we expect to continue to negatively impact, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also experience workforce disruptions in reaction to governmental restrictions or requirements, such as the ETS, if such restrictions or requirements become effective.\nOur businesses are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, considering the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience workforce disruptions or periods where our employees are unable to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19) or based upon shelter in place or other restrictions put in place by governmental authorities, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions, including as a result of employee absenteeism or widespread employee outbreaks, necessitating the temporary closure of manufacturing lines or partial facilities. These events, or similar events that could occur in the future, could have a material adverse impact on us in the future.\nWe operate in categories with strong competition.\nThe consumer food and beverage and convenient nutrition categories in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition in these categories is based on, among other things, brand recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to cost increases. Also, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks and digital platforms to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment and use social media and digital platforms effectively, it could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted us and our competitors differently based on the respective categories in which we and they operate and the effect of the pandemic on such categories. As a result, if our competitors were less negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than us, particularly if they had less exposure to the foodservice category, they may have had the ability to make more investments in their brands or processes during the pandemic, which could adversely impact us from a competitive perspective in the future.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, consumer at-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns regarding packaging and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company and operations. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences and behaviors and our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, consumers have increasingly been shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the housing of egg-laying hens, as well as certain other farm animals. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply, as well as goals for other farm animal initiatives, by specified future dates. Also, several states have enacted, or are proposing, provisions providing for specific requirements for the housing of certain farm animals. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing. In addition, our retail businesses are, and we expect will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the environmental impact of food packaging. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our businesses. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including adverse publicity about us, our business practices, products, packaging, ingredients or sponsorship or endorsement relationships (whether or not valid), our suppliers\u2019 or third party manufacturers\u2019 business practices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products, our products becoming unavailable to consumers or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. In addition, negative perceptions of the food and beverage industry as a whole, or segments of the food and beverage industry in which we operate, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, shareholders and other stakeholders to such factors and could adversely affect our brand image. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our business practices, brands, products, ingredients, packaging, sponsorship relationships, suppliers, third party manufacturers or the food and beverage industry generally (whether or not valid) in the media, especially on social or digital media, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands or if we experience a loss of consumer confidence in our brands, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nUncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may purchase less of our products, purchase more value or private label products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, our customers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales. Also, as a result of economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Further, uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has and could continue to negatively impact the financial stability of our customers or suppliers, which could lead to increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the ingredients used to make certain of our products, particularly eggs, pork, nuts, raw potatoes and grains, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. We may need to recall, withdraw or isolate some or all of our products if they become damaged, adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain. Such an incident could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of\nany product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, consolidation of our customer base, as well as competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our volumes or profit margins.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 19.0% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for 29.3% of Post Consumer Brands\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2021. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco, Asda and Morrison, accounted for 40.4% of Weetabix\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2021. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 32.4% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2021. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 31.7% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2021, and the largest customers of our BellRing Brands segment, Costco and Walmart, accounted for 65.3% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2021. For purposes of this risk factor, \u201cWalmart\u201d refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sam\u2019s Club.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters, mass merchandisers and national restaurant chains. The competition to supply products to these high-volume customers is intense. Currently, we do not have long-term supply agreements with a substantial number of our retail customers, including our largest customers. These high-volume customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations, which have resulted in mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers, including online food retailers, gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to this environment, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the growth of online food retailers, which has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our customers\u2019 responses to those changes could impact our businesses. Our businesses may be adversely affected if such non-traditional retailers take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers, if we are unable to effectively participate in such channels or if our customers fail to find ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities to enable them to grow their businesses. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature RTE cereal category, and the failure or weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, big box retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores primarily across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Ireland. Although the RTE cereal category experienced strong demand during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020 and continuing through the first half of fiscal 2021, the RTE cereal category had previously been experiencing weakness in recent years and the RTE cereal category has since returned to growth rates largely in line with pre-pandemic levels, with the U.S. value and private label RTE cereal segments underperforming relative to their pre-pandemic levels. Continuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products.\nSuccessful growth depends upon our ability to add new retail and foodservice customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio with new innovative and profitable products. This growth would include expanding the number of our products our customers offer for sale and our product placement. The expansion of the business of our existing segments depends upon our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, large-account customers, such as grocery store chains, mass merchandisers and foodservice distributors. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand our business with existing, large-account customers or enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For some of our businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our innovation and growth efforts as a result of reduced demand for certain products or as our customers modified their shelf reset timings, reduced in store-displays and promotional activities and shifted their ordering patterns to focus on our core products for shipments, which could adversely impact our long-term sales and profit growth.\nOur or 8th Avenue\u2019s private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nWe participate in the private brand food category, producing and distributing private label products, including through our investment in 8th Avenue. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us, 8th Avenue or our or 8th Avenue\u2019s customers to lose sales, which may require us or 8th Avenue to lower prices or increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, each of which would adversely affect our or 8th Avenue\u2019s margins, businesses, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include:\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country;\n\u2022unfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates, including those that may occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022challenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including those that have been caused or may in the future be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, which may cause us or our distributors, third party manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\n\u2022increased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity, acts of war and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.\u2019s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications;\n\u2022the difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security;\n\u2022the potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;\n\u2022increased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and\n\u2022the difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases.\nIn addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d) has created uncertainty surrounding certain of our businesses. The U.K. and the E.U. entered into a new trade agreement, which became effective as of January 1, 2021. We have implemented many process changes in light of the new agreement in order to reduce the risk and impact of Brexit on our businesses but the U.K. and the E.U. are still discussing future changes to the trade deal. We continue to plan to mitigate the potential effect of any new requirements which could increase costs, impact our customers, suppliers and employees, result in tariffs on certain imports and exports and impact the global economy and currency exchange rates, any of which could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our business.\nSome of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We periodically renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements in place at our facilities, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into new agreements in a timely manner, and if new agreements are not reached, there could be interruptions in production at the respective facilities. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our businesses, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIn the event of a work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our businesses. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our businesses in the event of a work stoppage, and particularly in the case of a prolonged work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 60 employees at our Weetabix facilities are currently engaged in a strike due to announced changes to shift patterns and related pay rates. There is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement with the union representing these employees in a timely manner, and although production has not been materially impacted at these facilities, if an agreement is not reached, we could experience interruption in production at these facilities.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use and the products we produce and distribute (or have produced or distributed by third parties), as well as increase the costs of production. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, product detentions, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nAvian influenza occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In 2015, an avian influenza outbreak occurred in the Midwest of the U.S., affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third party contracted flocks. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Diseases affecting livestock (including PEDV) occasionally impact sow supply, and diseases affecting cattle (including bovine spongiform encephalopathy) occasionally impact the availability of dairy-based proteins, which, in either case, also could adversely affect our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our businesses, reputation and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats and other grain products, fruits, nuts, proteins, eggs, potatoes, sows and dairy products. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels or our third party manufacturers\u2019 operations, particularly where a product is primarily sourced from a single location. Also, the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. Water is critical to our businesses, and the lack of available water of acceptable quality may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. Further, our businesses could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, shareholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability and governance matters. In addition, any failure to achieve goals we may set with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment can lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our or BellRing\u2019s guidance and our, BellRing\u2019s and PHPC\u2019s forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated and consolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and certain factors described in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included herein relates to our previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nSimilarly, BellRing, as a separate publicly-traded company whose financial results are consolidated into Post\u2019s financial statements, releases guidance regarding its future performance, which consists of forward-looking statements. In addition, PHPC, as a separate publicly-traded company, may make forward-looking statements as it pursues a partnering transaction. These statements are prepared by BellRing\u2019s and PHPC\u2019s management, respectively, and we do not accept any responsibility for any such statements.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices or on terms that are favorable to us. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our businesses and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture.\nEvaluating potential transactions, including divestitures and joint ventures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support any acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters.\nOur corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur pending distribution of our interest in BellRing is subject to inherent risks.\nOn October 26, 2021, we entered into the Transaction Agreement providing for the distribution of a significant portion of our ownership interest in BellRing to our shareholders. Completion of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, including the consummation of the BellRing Merger, is subject to certain conditions as set forth in the Transaction Agreement, including that (a) the Transaction Agreement be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority in voting power of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of BellRing and (ii) a majority in voting power of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of BellRing that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by Post, New BellRing or any of their respective affiliates; (b) completion of the BellRing Separation and the BellRing Distribution; (c) receipt of opinions with respect to the intended tax treatment of the BellRing Merger; and (d) applicable registration statements of New BellRing having become effective under the Securities Act. No assurance can be given that any of the foregoing conditions will be met. Completion of the transactions also are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, including, among others: risks that the proposed transactions as a whole will not be consummated; changes in tax law; increased demands on Post\u2019s and BellRing\u2019s management and employees to accomplish the proposed transactions; and significant transaction costs.\nThe BellRing Separation, the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger are expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2022, the second quarter of fiscal 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that all of the closing conditions for the BellRing Merger will be satisfied and, if they are satisfied, that they will be satisfied in time for the completion to occur during the period noted above. In addition, no assurance can be given that Post will realize the potential strategic and financial benefits from the proposed transactions in the near term or at all, and no assurance can be given that the market will react favorably to the proposed transactions.\nWe are subject to a number of uncertainties while PHPC pursues a partnering transaction, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOn May 28, 2021, PHPC completed its initial public offering. PHPC Sponsor, our wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased $40.0 million of PHPC Units in the PHPC IPO. In addition, PHPC Sponsor purchased PHPC Private Placement Units, which was completed substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, and holds shares of PHPC Series F Common Stock; PHPC Sponsor purchased the PHPC Private Placement Units and PHPC Series F Common Stock for approximately $10.9 million. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023 (which may be extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances). We will be required to devote significant management and employee attention and resources to matters relating to PHPC while it pursues a partnering transaction. If PHPC is unable to consummate a suitable partnering transaction during the prescribed two-year time frame, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders, and PHPC Sponsor would lose its investment in the PHPC Private Placement Units and PHPC Series F Common Stock. Alternatively, in the event that PHPC is able to consummate a suitable partnering transaction, or if the partnering transaction is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.\nThere has recently been heightened regulatory focus on SPACs, including recently issued accounting guidance, resulting in substantial uncertainty in the SPAC markets. PHPC\u2019s pursuit of a partnering transaction in this uncertain SPAC environment may result in delays, reduced investor and acquisition target interest in SPAC transactions, additional costs as instrument terms are reevaluated and our management and employees needing to devote extensive attention and resources to these matters. The\naccounting guidance applicable to SPACs could subsequently be revisited, potentially necessitating restatements of PHPC\u2019s financial statements, which could then impact and necessitate restatements of our financial statements. These matters have the potential to disrupt us from conducting business operations or pursuing other business strategies and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Company has overlapping directors and management with one or more of our related companies, including PHPC, BellRing and 8th Avenue, each of which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests.\nSeveral of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of one or more of our related companies, including PHPC, BellRing and 8th Avenue, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of such related companies have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s shareholders or stockholders, as appropriate. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more of the related companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in one or more of our related companies. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the related companies. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions;\n\u2022our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022integration may be more costly, time-consuming or complex or less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022inability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022we may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nIn addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. We had $7,057.6 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2021. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility had borrowing capacity of $730.8 million at September 30, 2021 (all of which would be secured when drawn). BellRing Brands, LLC had $609.9 million in aggregate principal amount of secured debt, which is included in our total debt amount referenced earlier in this paragraph, and borrowing capacity of $200.0 million under its secured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2021. Post and its subsidiaries (other than BellRing Brands, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries) are not obligors or guarantors under the BellRing Brands, LLC debt facilities.\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\n\u2022trigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022borrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities;\n\u2022make investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022enter into new lines of business;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022sell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30% of our revolving credit commitments. Our credit agreement permits us to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in our credit agreement. BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s credit agreement (the \u201cBellRing LLC credit agreement\u201d) contains a financial covenant requiring BellRing Brands, LLC to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the BellRing LLC credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nA default would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures and credit agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt, and their financial resources and assets may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have designated 8th Avenue, BellRing, PHPC Sponsor and PHPC and their respective subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not secure our obligations under our credit agreement. A substantial majority of the assets of PHPC are held in trust and are not available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness. In addition, 8th Avenue and BellRing Brands, LLC have entered into secured credit facilities that are separate from our credit agreement and senior note indentures and that restrict, among other matters, their ability to make distributions to us or engage in transactions with us. Accordingly, the financial resources and other assets of 8th Avenue, BellRing Brands, LLC, PHPC Sponsor and PHPC and their respective subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness or, if available, may be significantly limited.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nOur ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022sales of assets;\n\u2022sales of equity;\n\u2022reduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in a sufficient amount, to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we did not have debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. However, in the future, we may have debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. In addition, the aggregate principal amount of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $609.9 million as of September 30, 2021. Higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our and BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, each one hundred basis points change in the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) would result in an approximate $3.0 million change in the annual cash interest\nexpense, before any principal payment, on BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, including the impact of the $350.0 million in interest rate swap agreements held by BellRing Brands, LLC and excluding the impact of any interest rate floors (as defined in the BellRing Brands, LLC credit agreement). At September 30, 2021, we held interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1,749.3 million, excluding the interest rate swaps held by BellRing Brands, LLC, to lock into a fixed LIBOR rate for debt expected to be issued but not yet priced.\nCertain of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s variable rate debt and our secured revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. In addition, certain of BellRing\u2019s and our hedging transactions reference LIBOR as a benchmark rate in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced in July 2017 that it intended to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021; in March 2021, the FCA extended the transition dates of certain LIBOR tenors (including tenors used in our credit agreement and the BellRing Brands, LLC credit agreement) to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. While both our credit agreement and the BellRing Brands, LLC credit agreement contain provisions intended to address the anticipated unavailability of LIBOR, it is unclear if alternative rates or benchmarks will be widely adopted. Also, there may be uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts under the terms of the governing agreement or instrument. This uncertainty could result in different financial results under our or BellRing\u2019s hedge or swap transactions, require different hedging strategies or require renegotiation of existing agreements or instruments. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also can be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues, including those that have arisen or may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been periods, and there may in the future be periods, of increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. This and other events affecting the credit markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow money, if necessary. Our businesses also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy, whether resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations, limit our ability to expand our businesses or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability.\nInflationary pressures and shortages in the labor market have increased, and could continue to increase, our labor costs, which have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our profitability. Labor costs also include the costs of providing medical and other health and welfare benefits to our employees as well as certain former employees. With approximately 10,735 employees as of November 1, 2021 (which excludes the employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by the costs of such benefits. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. In addition, we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor-related costs, including costs that we may incur as a result of the ETS. Any substantial increase in these costs could have a materially negative impact on our profitability.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and are not amortized. Management reviews all intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA (which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. We also continue to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fair value of our intangible assets. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2020 and 2021, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. In fiscal 2019, we had an impairment of both goodwill and other definite-lived intangible assets. See further discussion of these impairments in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this report and Notes 2 and 8 within \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this report.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In certain instances, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and continues to result in delays of certain cost-saving and productivity initiatives. Continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives or impact our ability to complete projects to reduce costs or improve efficiency on planned timelines. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIf our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the third parties that have invested with us in 8th Avenue have certain governance and other rights in 8th Avenue that could result in delayed decisions or disputes that adversely impact its operations, as well as liquidity rights commencing on October 1, 2022 that could result in the compelled sale or initial public offering of 8th Avenue.\nAs a result of the 8th Avenue Formation Transactions, we hold 6.05 million shares of 8th Avenue Class B common stock, and third parties and members of 8th Avenue\u2019s management team together hold 3.95 million shares of 8th Avenue Class A common stock and 2.5 million shares of 8th Avenue Series A preferred stock. Our 60.5% retained interest in 8th Avenue is accounted for using the equity method, and the carrying value of the investment in 8th Avenue is included on our balance sheet and returns from our investment in 8th Avenue are included in our results of operations. If our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAlthough we hold a substantial majority of the voting power of 8th Avenue\u2019s common stock and have the power to appoint a majority of the members of 8th Avenue\u2019s board of directors, third parties hold certain corporate governance and other rights with respect to 8th Avenue, and we cannot control the actions of such third parties. Such third parties may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with each other and our business interests or goals, which may result in delayed decisions or disputes and could potentially adversely impact the business and operations of 8th Avenue and, in turn, our businesses and operations. In addition, such third parties have certain liquidity, including securities registration, rights commencing on October 1, 2022 that could result in the compelled sale or initial public offering of 8th Avenue. If these rights are exercised, we and 8th Avenue could be required to devote significant management and employee attention and resources to liquidity transactions, and the potential transactions may disrupt both us and 8th Avenue from conducting business and could adversely affect our and 8th Avenue\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is no assurance that we will realize benefits from any liquidity transaction, including proceeds from a sale of 8th Avenue, in an amount or level satisfactory to us. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment and result in realized losses.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations of our manufacturing costs will cause volatility in our margins and net earnings.\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, resulting in volatility in our margins and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in \u201cCost of goods sold\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated corporate items outside of our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits.\nWe maintain and contribute to qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses. With respect to those plans we maintain, we are obligated to ensure that these plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nViolations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to a variety of laws and extensive regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities for both the countries where we manufacture or license products, primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and those where we distribute products, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, animal welfare, worker health and workplace safety. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Internationally, we are regulated by, among other authorities, Health Canada, the U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed or licensed.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to heightened regulations. Specifically, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses\u2019 meat and egg products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. Some of our BellRing Brands products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny that are different from those applicable to conventional food. Internationally, certain of our BellRing Brands products are regulated as food and dietary supplements. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs.\nGovernmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our businesses or the businesses of our customers or suppliers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, product and equipment seizures, import and export restrictions, price controls, governmental and regulatory actions, including the ETS, mandatory business closures and other restrictions that have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or interpretations thereof or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers, suppliers or third party manufacturers, causing our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, Canada has enacted new food safety laws, and some states have passed laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which has resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in us incurring additional operating and capital costs in the future. The limited availability of government inspectors due to a government shutdown, government restrictions, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases or closed borders also could cause disruption to our manufacturing facilities.\nIt also is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties, revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or permits, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any claims, such as product liability or labeling claims, resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, including as a result of the contract suspension notices delivered to certain of our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and fees in defending such actions or asserting our rights, be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents or breaches of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, including production, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third party manufacturers and suppliers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of such networks and systems increased while many of our employees were working remotely. Our and our third party vendors\u2019 information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, user error, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our businesses.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to, among other things, billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by individuals and groups (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons).\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition,\nthere is a risk of business interruption, competitive loss, litigation, reputational damage and other losses from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs.\nWe implement and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information), the effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly. An information or cybersecurity incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, vendor information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property. There are several motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. We are subject to attempted cyber intrusions, hacks and ransom attacks and although we have not detected a material security breach to date, we have had and continue to experience events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding personal information, data privacy, data protection and data security. Several states as well as foreign governments have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.\u2019s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Transaction\u201d) to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Buyer\u201d), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the sale agreement, together with agreements related thereto, collectively referred to as the \u201cRestaurants Sale Agreement\u201d). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement.\nIn addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evans\u2019s restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guarantees relating to the leases on such restaurant properties (the \u201cGuarantees\u201d), which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. The Guarantees have subsequently been reduced to 129 properties. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the Guarantees, we remain liable for payments due under any of the leases that remain in place if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the Guarantees or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters\nand logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset to us. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements, confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesses. In addition, as certain of our trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are subject to licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert management\u2019s attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate environmental matters.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the \u201carticles of incorporation\u201d), our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cbylaws\u201d) and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022our Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board;\n\u2022elimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings;\n\u2022rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022anti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and\n\u2022limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the Internal Revenue Service or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that future tax law changes, including proposals under the Build Back Better bill, will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, announcements we make about our business, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, market data that is available to subscribers, reports by industry analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow us, industry or market trends, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, future sales of our common stock or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions, including those that result from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nYour percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly-traded company, our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the vesting of those equity awards. For a brief discussion of our equity incentive plan, see Note 20 within \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this report.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBellRing and PHPC, as publicly-traded companies, also are each separately subject to SOX. Because PHPC is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (\u201cEGC\u201d) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, its independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under SOX. BellRing, which ceased to be an EGC during fiscal 2021, is required to comply with this requirement under SOX. Similarly, at the time that PHPC ceases to be an EGC, it also will be subject to this requirement under SOX. Further, if BellRing and PHPC do not satisfy the requirements imposed by SOX, or if they do not have effective internal control over financial reporting, any such occurrences could impact our ability to satisfy our SOX requirements and could impair the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event that we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2021, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nActions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our businesses could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.", "PERMNO": 13188, "SIC": 2015, "TIC": "POST"}
