{"cik": "946454", "company": "BALLANTYNE STRONG, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in shares of our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events. Also refer to the note regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nNew and expanded lines of business are a part of our strategy to compensate for the lower demand for our digital cinema products and installation services.\nA significant portion of our revenue in recent years has been generated from the theatre exhibition industry\u2019s need for digital cinema equipment and service to support the industries transformation from film to digital equipment. This required the Company to commit substantial resources to the process of retrofitting existing theatre complexes by removing the film equipment and replacing it with digital equipment, and experienced significant financial gains from this work. With the completion of this digital conversion by North America theatre exhibitors, we will no longer be able to rely on that income as a major source of our earnings. If we are unable to expand our revenue streams with other products and services, our future growth would be significantly curtailed.\nGrowth through acquisition is part of our business plan and can inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nWe continually review acquisition opportunities that will enhance our market position, expand our product lines and provide sufficient synergies. Any of the following risks associated with our past acquisitions or future acquisitions, individually or in aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or stock price:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in realizing anticipated financial or strategic benefits of such acquisitions,\n\u25cf\ndiversion of capital from other uses and potential dilution of stockholder ownership,\n\u25cf\nrisks of increased indebtedness,\n\u25cf\nsignificant capital expenditures may be required to integrate the acquisition into our operations,\n\u25cf\ndisruption of our ongoing business or the ongoing acquired business, including impairment of relationships with our employees, distributors, suppliers or customers or those of the acquired companies,\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources from current operations, including potential strain on financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures,\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in integrating acquired operations, including restructuring and realigning activities, personnel, technologies and products, including loss of key employees, distributors, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses,\n\u25cf\ninability to realize cost savings, sales increases or other benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions, either as to amount or in the expected time frame,\n\u25cf\nassumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify,\n\u25cf\nnon-cash impairment charges or other accounting charges relating to the acquired assets.\nInterruptions of, or higher prices of components from our suppliers may affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nA portion of our revenues are dependent on the distribution of products supplied by various key suppliers. We believe we have good supplier relationships and that we are generally able to obtain adequate pricing and other terms from our suppliers. However, if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with them or if our suppliers experience significant financial problems, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services. Some suppliers could also decide to reduce inventories or raise prices to increase cash flow. The loss of any one or more of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business unless alternative manufacturing arrangements are secured.\nThe markets for our cinema products are highly competitive and if market share is lost, we may be unable to lower our cost structure quickly enough to offset the loss of revenue.\nWithin the cinema market, the domestic and international markets for our product lines are highly competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological and other changes. We expect the intensity of competition in each of these areas to continue in the future due to a number of reasons including:\n\u25cf\nCertain of the competitors for our digital equipment have significantly greater resources than we do.\n\u25cf\nSome of our competitors are manufacturing their own digital equipment, whereas, we employ a distribution business model through our distribution agreements with NEC, BARCO and certain other suppliers. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\n\u25cf\nSuppliers could decide to utilize their current sales force to take their products direct to customers versus utilizing channels\nIf we are not able to develop and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new software solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing software platform, identify new software partners which will allow us to continually introduce or acquire new features that are in demand by the market we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion and integration, adequate quality testing, introduction and market acceptance. Any new platform or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, for technologies that are acquired, we may not be able to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired technology at a rate that is consistent with the market\u2019s expectations.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large enterprises, which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe timing of our sales is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers, frequently at an executive level, about the use, potential return on investment, technical capabilities, security and other benefits of our solution. Customers often undertake a prolonged product-evaluation process which frequently involves not only our solutions but also those of our competitors. As we continue to target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, long sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to our solution is often an enterprise-wide decision and, may require us to provide even greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solution and obtain support from multiple departments. In addition, prospective enterprise customers may require customized features and functions unique to their business process that may need acceptance testing related to those unique features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support, operational support and professional services resources to individual customers, increasing costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions.\nWe are substantially dependent upon significant customers who could cease purchasing our products at any time.\nThe Company\u2019s top ten customers accounted for approximately 38% of 2014 consolidated net revenues and were from the systems integration and managed services segments. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately 38% of net consolidated receivables at December 31, 2014. While the Company believes its relationships with such customers are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Company\u2019s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets that are subject to annual valuation testing.\nAt December 31, 2014, we have recorded net deferred tax assets of $7.7 million. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If it would be determined that some or all of these assets would not be realized, valuation reserves would be required which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the economic and political risks of selling products in foreign countries.\nSales outside the United States (mainly cinema) continue to be significant, accounting for approximately 35% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2014, which include $14.0 million of sales in China. This compared to 35% in 2013 of which $16.6 were generated in China. Foreign sales are subject to political and economic risks, including political instability, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to sales not denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates. A significant amount of our foreign sales are denominated in foreign currencies and amounted to $21.9 million in 2014. To the extent that orders are denominated in foreign currencies, our reported sales and earnings are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our remaining international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. For those sales which are denominated in U.S. dollars, a weakening in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse impact on us by increasing the effective price of our products in international markets. Certain areas of the world are also more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollar due to our screen manufacturing facility in Canada where a majority of their sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar while their expenses are denominated in Canadian currency. We cannot assure that these factors will not adversely affect our foreign activities in the future.\nThe risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nOur global operations subject us to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws, regulations and policies, which could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include import and export control, environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws and work councils and anti-corruption and bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.N. Convention Against Bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our affiliated entities, contractors, agents or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, and debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nA challenging global economic environment or a downturn in the markets we serve could adversely affect our operating results and stock price in a material manner.\nThe current issues in the global credit markets and weak worldwide economies may continue to negatively impact the markets we serve. This environment could serve to reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. These economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers which could affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demand. The Company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the Company sells its products.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business, including maintaining client information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to outages and deliberate intrusion. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. While we have taken measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent outages or security breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our business reputation.\nIf we fail to retain key members of management, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur success depends, in substantial part, on the efforts and abilities of our current management team. Many of these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Ballantyne and its operations. If certain of these individuals were to leave unexpectedly, we could face difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience.\nOur stock price is vulnerable to significant fluctuations.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, general conditions in the industries in which we operate and other factors. In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for the stock of many companies generally, which fluctuations often are unrelated to operating performance.", "PERMNO": 82234, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "BTN"}
