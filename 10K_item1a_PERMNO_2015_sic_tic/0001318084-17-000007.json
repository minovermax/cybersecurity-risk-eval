Set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face, the occurrence of which may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired by the risks and costs associated with expansion activities.\nOur business has expanded rapidly and market share growth is one of our key company initiatives. To accomplish this growth we have focused on strategic acquisitions and securing large regional and national customers as key elements of success. Any significant expansion activity comes with inherent risks. Acquisitions may entail various risks such as identifying suitable candidates, realizing acceptable rates of return on the investment, identifying potential liabilities, obtaining adequate financing, negotiating acceptable terms and conditions, and successfully integrating operations and converting systems post acquisition. Integrating a large new customer has similar risks of realizing acceptable returns on invested working capital, negotiating acceptable pricing and service levels, while managing resources and business interruptions as we integrate the new business into our current infrastructure. We may realize higher costs, lower margins or fewer benefits than originally anticipated and may experience disruption to our base business in connection with such acquisitions and other new customer integration activities.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining qualified labor including our senior management and other key personnel.\nWe substantially depend on the continued services and performance of our senior executive officers as named in our Proxy Statement and other key employees. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on these individuals, and we do not have employment agreements with any of them. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers or other key personnel could harm our business.\nWe compete with other businesses in each of our markets with respect to attracting and retaining qualified employees. A shortage of qualified employees, especially drivers, in a market could require us to enhance our wage and benefit packages in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees or to hire more expensive temporary employees. Any such shortage of qualified employees could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and might lead to lower profits because of higher labor costs.\nOur ability to meet our labor needs is generally subject to numerous other external factors, including prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. These external factors could prevent us from locating, attracting or retaining qualified personnel, which would impact the quality of the services which provide to our customers, and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the convenience retail industry, and our results of operations could suffer if it experiences an overall decline or consolidation.\nThe majority of our sales are made under purchase orders and short-term contracts with convenience retail stores which inherently involve significant risks. These risks include declining sales in the convenience retail industry due to general economic conditions, including rising gasoline prices, which may impact \u201cin-store\u201d retail sales, competition from grocery stores and other retail outlets, termination of customer relationships and consolidation of our customer base. Such events could cause us to experience decreases in revenues and put pressure on our margins and increase our credit risk and potential bad debt exposure.\nMany of the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we may lose market share and suffer a decline in sales and profitability in these markets if we are unable to outperform our competition.\nOur distribution centers operate in highly competitive markets. We face competition from local, regional and national tobacco and consumable products distributors on the basis of service, price, reliability, delivery schedules, and variety of products offered. We also face competition from club stores and alternate sources that sell consumable products to convenience retailers. Some of our competitors, including McLane Company, Inc. (a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), have substantial financial resources and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, heightened competition among our existing competitors, or by new entrants into the distribution market, could create additional competitive pressures that may result in the loss of major customers, reduced margins, or have other adverse effects on our business. If we fail to successfully respond to these competitive pressures or to implement our strategies effectively, we may lose market share and our results of operations could suffer.\nOur failure to maintain relationships with large customers could potentially harm our business.\nWe have relationships with many large regional and national convenience and other store chains. While we expect to maintain these relationships for the foreseeable future, any termination, non-renewal or reduction in services that we provide to such customers could cause our revenues and operating results to suffer.\nWe may lose business if manufacturers or large retail customers convert to direct distribution of their products.\nIn the past, certain large manufacturers and customers have elected to engage in direct distribution or third party distribution of their products and eliminate wholesale distributors such as Core-Mark. If other manufacturers or retail customers make similar elections in the future, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate such losses.\nOur business is sensitive to fuel prices and related transportation costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operating results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation-related costs, including costs from the use of third party carriers, temporary staff and overtime. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of increases in our own fuel or other transportation costs to our customers in the form of fuel or delivery surcharges, but our ability to continue to pass through these increases, is not assured. If we are unable to continue to pass on fuel and transportation-related cost increases to our customers or do not realize the benefits we expect from converting a large percentage of our trucks to operate on natural gas or incur higher expenses if the price of diesel fuel decreases but the price of natural gas does not similarly decrease, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nCigarette and consumable goods distribution is a low-margin business sensitive to inflation and deflation.\nWe derive most of our revenues from the distribution of cigarettes, other tobacco products, candy, snacks, fast food, groceries, fresh products, dairy, beverages, general merchandise and health and beauty care products. Our industry is characterized by a high volume of sales with low profit margins. Our food/non-food sales are generally priced based on the manufacturer\u2019s cost of the product plus a percentage markup. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of cost deflation or stagnation for these products, even though our gross profit as a percentage of the price of goods sold may remain relatively constant. In addition, periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our gross profit margins with respect to sales of cigarettes because gross profit on cigarette sales are generally fixed on a cents per carton basis. Therefore, as cigarette prices increase, gross profit generally decreases as a percentage of sales. In addition, if the cost of the cigarettes that we purchase increases due to manufacturer price increases, reduced or eliminated manufacturer discounts and incentive programs or increases in applicable excise tax rates, our inventory carrying costs and accounts receivable could rise, placing pressure on our working capital requirements.\nWe rely on manufacturer discount and incentive programs and cigarette excise stamping allowances, and any material changes in these programs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe receive payments from the manufacturers on the products we distribute for allowances, discounts, volume rebates and other merchandising and incentive programs. These payments are a substantial contributor to our gross profit. The amount and timing of these payments are affected by changes in the programs by the manufacturers, our ability to sell specified volumes of a particular product, attaining specified levels of purchases by our customers and the duration of carrying a specified product. In addition, we receive discounts from certain taxing jurisdictions in connection with the collection of excise taxes. If the manufacturers or taxing jurisdictions change or discontinue these programs or change the timing of payments, or if we are unable to maintain the volume of our sales required by such programs, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe depend on relatively few suppliers for a large portion of our products, and any interruptions in the supply of the products that we distribute could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe obtain the products we distribute from third party suppliers. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,000 vendors and during 2016 we purchased approximately 79% of our products from our top 20 suppliers, with purchases from our top two suppliers, Philip Morris USA, Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, representing approximately 35% and 23% of our purchases, respectively. We do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us. Our suppliers may not provide the products we distribute in the quantities we request on favorable terms, or at all. We are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production due to conditions outside our control, such as slow-downs or strikes by employees of suppliers, inclement weather, transportation interruptions, regulatory requirements and natural disasters. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of the products we distribute could cause us to fail to meet our contractual and other obligations to our customers and reduce the volume of our sales and profitability.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and counterfeit product claims which could materially adversely affect our business.\nAs a distributor of food and consumer products, we face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of a product sold by us causes injury or illness. In addition, certain products that we distribute may be subject to counterfeiting. Our business could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food and other products we distribute. Further, our operations could be subject to disruptions as a result of manufacturer recalls. This risk may increase as we continue to expand our distribution of fresh products. If we do not have adequate insurance, if contractual indemnification\nfrom the supplier or manufacturer of the defective, contaminated or counterfeit product is not available, or if a supplier or manufacturer cannot fulfill its indemnification obligations to us, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from the implementation of marketing initiatives.\nWe are continuously improving our competitive performance through a series of strategic marketing initiatives. The goal of this effort is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy, addressing the special needs of the convenience industry environment, increasing our market position within the industry and ultimately creating increased stockholder value. Customer acceptance of our new marketing initiatives may not be as anticipated or competitive pressures may cause us to curtail or abandon these initiatives, resulting in lower revenue growth and unachieved cost savings.\nMaintaining our brand and reputation is necessary for the success of our business.\nOur established brand and reputation within the market largely contributes to our success. Our current and future business could be negatively impacted if we were poorly represented or garnered negative publicity through various media channels, which include but are not limited to, print, broadcast, web-based, and social media. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Even if the aforementioned situations were unfounded or not material to our business, these events could still diminish demand for our products and services and erode customer confidence. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur information technology systems may be subject to failure, disruptions, security breaches (such as malware, viruses, hacking or other cyber-attacks) which could compromise our ability to conduct business, seriously harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is highly dependent on our enterprise information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems and our internal information technology staff to maintain the information required to operate our distribution centers and to provide our customers with fast, efficient and reliable deliveries. We have taken steps to increase redundancy in our information technology systems and have disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate events that could disrupt our systems\u2019 service. However, if our systems fail or are not reliable, we may suffer disruptions in service to our customers and our results of operations could suffer.\nWe may upgrade and replace various components of our proprietary enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system periodically with the goal of maintaining and improving overall functionality, performance and service. As technology-based solutions become more integrated with our service offerings, our ability to service our customers could be impacted, creating additional competitive pressure and causing us to lose market share.\nIn addition, we retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We may face threats to our data centers and networks of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by experienced hackers or other disruptive events.\nComputer malware, viruses, hacking and other cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and may occur on our systems in the future. Intruders may also take the form of parties that attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive or confidential information or otherwise disrupt operations. Any such security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information belonging to us or our customers, business partners or employees. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability and security affects the availability of our technical infrastructure and technology-based services. Any such failure may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and could impact our results of operation.\nWe may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and cash flows.\nUnions may attempt to organize our employees.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 325, or approximately 4%, of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations, which agreements expire at various times. We cannot assure that we will be able to renew our respective\ncollective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, that employees at other facilities will not unionize or that our labor costs will not increase. In addition, the United States National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") is becoming more active with the passage of administrative rules that could impact our ability to manage our labor force and wage successful campaigns preventing further unionization of our employees. To the extent we suffer business interruptions as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or slow-downs, or our labor costs increase and we are not able to recover such increases through increased prices charged to customers or offsets by productivity gains, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nEmployee health benefit costs represent a significant expense to us and may negatively affect our profitability.\nWith over 5,000 employees and their families participating in our health plans, our expenses relating to employee health benefits are substantial. In past years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, including, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Increased participation in our health plans, continued increasing health care costs, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate health and benefit expenses, may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") may continue to increase our employee healthcare-related costs. We have migrated a significant number of employees to our high deductible plan resulting in a reduction in our claims exposure and offsetting other costs related to ACA. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of ACA, there is no guarantee our efforts will be successful.\nChanges to minimum wage laws and other governmental legislation or regulations could increase our costs substantially.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no employees who were paid under the minimum wage in their respective locations. Several bills have been introduced in the U.S. legislature over the past few years to increase the federal minimum wage. In addition, certain states have adopted or are considering adopting minimum wage statutes that exceed the federal minimum wage rate. Any increases in federal or state minimum wages could require us to increase the wages paid to our minimum wage employees and create pressure to raise wages for other employees who already earn above-minimum wages. If we are unable to pass these additional labor costs on to our customers in the form of increased prices or surcharges, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to comply with governmental regulations that affect our business or if there are substantial changes in these regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nAs a distributor of food and other consumable products, we are subject to regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and similar regulatory authorities at the federal,state, provincial and local levels. In addition, our employees operate tractor trailers, trucks, forklifts and various other powered material handling equipment and we are therefore subject to regulation by the U.S. and Canadian Departments of Transportation. Our operations are also subject to regulation by OSHA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a myriad of other federal, state, provincial and local agencies. Each of these regulatory authorities has broad administrative powers with respect to our operations. Regulations, and the costs of complying with those regulations, have been increasing in recent years. If we fail to adequately comply with government regulations, we could experience increased inspections or audits, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nNatural disaster damage could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur headquarters and several of our warehouses in California, and one warehouse located near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, are in or near high hazard earthquake zones. We also have operations in areas that have been affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, floods, and ice and snow storms. While we maintain insurance to cover us for certain potential losses, our insurance may not be sufficient in the event of a significant natural disaster or payments under our policies may not be received timely enough to prevent adverse impacts on our business. Our customers could also be affected by like events, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nInsurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our operations throughout North America, including claims exposure resulting from personal injury, property damage, business interruption and workers\u2019 compensation. Workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we lose our ability to self-insure these risks, our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to the Distribution of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products\nOur sales volume is largely dependent upon the distribution of cigarettes, sales of which are declining generally.\nThe distribution of cigarettes is currently a significant portion of our business. In 2016, approximately 71.1% of our net sales (which includes excise taxes) and 29.9% of our gross profit were generated from the distribution of cigarettes. Due to increases in the prices of cigarettes, restrictions on cigarette manufacturers\u2019 marketing and promotions, increases in cigarette regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups, the rise in popularity of tobacco alternatives, including electronic cigarettes, and other factors, cigarette consumption in the U.S. and Canada has been declining gradually over the past few decades. In most instances, tobacco alternatives, such as electronic cigarettes, are not subject to federal, state, provincial and local excise taxes like the sale of conventional cigarettes or other tobacco products. We expect consumption trends of legal cigarette products will continue to be negatively impacted by the factors described above. In addition, we expect rising prices may lead to a higher percentage of consumers purchasing cigarettes through illicit markets, over the internet and by other means designed to avoid payment of cigarette taxes. If we are unable to sell other products to make up for these declines in cigarette unit sales, our operating results may suffer.\nLegislation, regulation and other matters are negatively affecting the cigarette and tobacco industry.\nThe tobacco industry is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations regarding the marketing, distribution, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products imposed by governmental entities. Various jurisdictions have adopted or are considering legislation and regulations restricting displays and marketing of tobacco products, establishing fire safety standards for cigarettes, raising the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products, requiring the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products, imposing restrictions on public smoking, restricting the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other recipients over the internet and other tobacco product regulation. In addition, the FDA has been empowered to regulate changes to nicotine yields and the chemicals and flavors used in tobacco products (including cigars, pipe and e-cigarette products), require ingredient listings be displayed on tobacco products, prohibit the use of certain terms which may attract youth or mislead users as to the risks involved with using tobacco products, as well as limit or otherwise impact the marketing of tobacco products by requiring additional labels or warnings as well as pre-approval by the FDA. Such legislation and related regulation is likely to continue adversely impacting the market for tobacco products and, accordingly, our sales of such products.\nIn Canada, many provinces have enacted legislation authorizing and facilitating the recovery by provincial governments of tobacco-related health care costs from the tobacco industry by way of lawsuit. Some Canadian provincial governments have either already initiated lawsuits or indicated an intention that such lawsuits will be filed. It is unclear at this time how such restrictions and lawsuits may affect Core-Mark and its Canadian operations.\nIf excise taxes are increased or credit terms are reduced, our sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products could decline and our liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nCigarettes and tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the U.S. and Canada. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes and/or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted by various taxing jurisdictions within the U.S. and Canada as a means of increasing government revenues. These tax increases negatively impact consumption. Additionally, they may cause a shift in sales from premium brands to discount brands, illicit channels or tobacco alternatives, such as electronic cigarettes, as smokers seek lower priced options.\nTaxing jurisdictions have the ability to change or rescind credit terms currently extended for the remittance of tax that we collect on their behalf. If these excise taxes are substantially increased or credit terms are substantially reduced, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity. Accordingly, we may be required to obtain additional debt financing, which we may not be able to obtain on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products exposes us to potential liabilities.\nIn June 1994, the Mississippi attorney general brought an action against various tobacco industry members on behalf of the state to recover state funds paid for health care costs related to tobacco use. Most other states sued the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers based on similar theories. In November 1998, the major U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into a Master Settlement Agreement (\"MSA\") with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories. The other four states--Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (non-MSA states)--settled their litigations with the major cigarette manufacturers by separate agreements. The MSA and the other state settlement agreements settled health care cost recovery actions and monetary claims relating to future conduct arising out of the use of, or exposure to, tobacco products, imposed a stream of future payment obligations on major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and placed significant restrictions on the ability to market and sell cigarettes. The payments required under the MSA result in the products sold by the participating manufacturers to be priced at higher levels than non-MSA manufacturers. In addition, the growth in market share of discount brands since the MSA was signed has had an adverse impact on the total volume of the cigarettes that we sell.\nIn connection with the MSA, we were indemnified by most of the tobacco product manufacturers from which we purchased cigarettes and other tobacco products for liabilities arising from our sale of the tobacco products that they supplied to us. Should the MSA ever be invalidated, we could be subject to substantial litigation due to our distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products, and we may not be indemnified for such costs by the tobacco product manufacturers in the future. In addition, even if we are indemnified by cigarette manufacturers that are parties to the MSA, future litigation awards against such cigarette manufacturers could be so large as to prevent the manufacturers from satisfying their indemnification obligations.\nT\nRisks Related to Financial Matters, Financing and Foreign Exchange\nChanges to federal, state or provincial income tax legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, new tax legislation is adopted by the federal government and various states or other regulatory bodies. Significant changes in tax legislation could adversely affect our business or results of operations in a material way. For example, in the U.S. the federal government has in the past proposed legislation which effectively could limit, or even eliminate, use of the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory method for financial and income tax purposes. Although the final outcome of any such proposals cannot be ascertained, the ultimate financial impact to us of the transition from LIFO to another inventory method could be material to our operating results.\nWe may not be able to settle our qualified defined benefit pension plan on terms or pricing which is satisfactory to us.\nWe record a liability associated with the underfunded status of our pension plan when the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2016, our pension plan was 88% funded and our consolidated balance sheet included $4.3 million in pension liabilities related to underfunded pension obligations. On September 14, 2016, our Board of Directors approved termination of our qualified defined-benefit pension plan. We expect to complete the settlement before the end of 2017. Our pension liabilities are expected to be settled through either lump sum payments or purchasing annuities from an insurance Company. We may not be able to consummate the sale or purchase of annuities with counterparties on terms or pricing suitable to us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in the future or in any particular amounts and if there is a reduction in dividend payments, our stock price may be harmed.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2011, we have paid a quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements to which we are a party. Future dividends may be affected by a variety of factors such as available cash, anticipated working capital requirements, overall financial condition, credit agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, capital requirements for acquisitions, stock repurchase programs, reserves for legal risks and changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any such action could have a material, negative effect on our stock price.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues in Canadian dollars, approximately 10% in 2016 and 11% in 2015. We also incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canadian dollars. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in Canadian dollars with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in Canadian dollars could have an adverse effect on our financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our Canadian operations will be reduced because the Canadian currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, during times of a weakening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our Canadian operations will be increased because the Canadian currency will be translated into more U.S. dollars. U.S. GAAP requires that foreign currency transaction gains or losses on short-term intercompany transactions be recorded currently as gains or losses within the statement of operations. To the extent we incur losses on such transactions, our net income will be reduced. We currently do not hedge our Canadian foreign currency cash flows.\nWe may not be able to borrow additional capital to provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources necessary to meet our future financial obligations.\nWe expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations and, if necessary, borrowings under a $600 million revolving credit facility (\"Credit Facility\") as of December 31, 2016. On November 4, 2016, we entered into a ninth amendment to the Credit Facility which increased our Credit Facility from $450 million to $600 million. The Credit Facility, initially dated as of October 12, 2005, as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, is between us, as Borrowers, the Lenders named therein, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Facility expires in May 2020. While\nwe believe our sources of liquidity are adequate, we cannot assure that these sources will be available or continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources required to meet our future financial obligations, or to provide funds for our working capital, capital expenditures and other needs. As such, additional equity or debt financing sources may be necessary, in addition we may not be able to expand our existing Credit Facility or obtain new financing on terms satisfactory to us.\nOur operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our Credit Facility.\nOur Credit Facility imposes restrictions on us that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry. Specifically, these restrictions place limits on our ability, among other things, to: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, issue stock of subsidiaries, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, or transfer and sell our assets. In addition, under our Credit Facility, under certain circumstances we are required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with this covenant may be affected by factors beyond our control and a breach of the covenant could result in an event of default under our Credit Facility, which would permit the lenders to declare all amounts incurred thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ as a result of the accounting methods, estimates and assumptions that we use in preparing our financial statements, which may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in selecting and applying accounting methodologies and making estimates and assumptions. These methods, estimates, and assumptions are subject to uncertainties and changes, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include but are not limited to the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, provisions for income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional allowances, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations, valuation of pension assets and obligations, stock-based compensation expense and accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.", "PERMNO": 91018, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "CORE"}
