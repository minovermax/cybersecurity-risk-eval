{"cik": "1235468", "company": "LIQUIDITY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not in any particular order and are not the only significant risks we may face. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on contracts with the United States Department of Defense and for a significant portion of our revenue, and if our relationships with these customers are disrupted, we would experience a significant decrease in revenue and income.\nWe have two material contracts with the DLA Disposition Services under which we acquire, manage and sell surplus and scrap property of the DoD. If our relationship with the DoD is impaired, we are not awarded new DoD contracts when our current contracts expire, any of our DoD contracts are terminated or the supply of assets under the contracts is significantly decreased, we would experience a significant decrease in revenue and have difficulty generating income. The Surplus Contract accounted for 27.7%, 26.8%, and 24.7% of our revenue and 15.0%, 14.3%, and 12.3% of our GMV for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Scrap Contract accounted for 13.5%, 14.4%, and 15.3% of our revenue and 7.0%, 7.7%, and 7.6% of our GMV in fiscal year 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We believe that these contracts will continue to be the source of a significant portion of our revenue and GMV during their respective terms. The current Surplus Contract has a three-year base term that expired in February 2012, subject to the DoD's right to extend for two additional one-year terms. The DoD has exercised both extension options. In January 2014, the DoD awarded the Company a follow-on contract to extend the terms of the current Surplus Contract for a base term of ten months with two one-month renewal option periods. The DoD has exercised both renewal options. In February 2015, the DoD awarded the Company a second follow-on contract to the current Surplus Contract for a base term of six months with three 30-day additional option periods. The DoD has exercised all three 30-day renewal options which extends the Surplus Contract until November 14, 2015. On November 13, 2015, the DLA Disposition Services notified us that they were amending the current Surplus Contract to extend the wind-down period by an additional ten months to allow for the continued processing of usable non-rolling stock surplus property. All other terms, including pricing, remain consistent with the current Surplus Contract. The Scrap Contract has a seven-year base term that expired in June 2012, subject to the DoD's right to extend for three additional one-year terms. The DoD has exercised its right to extend the performance period of the Scrap Contract to June 2015. This Scrap Contract was further modified on June 9, 2015 to extend the Scrap Contract for an additional nine months, subject to the DoD's right to extend the contract for three additional three-month option periods. As part of the June 9, 2015 amendment, modifications were also made to the principal terms of the Scrap Contract including that: (i) contract pricing will be adjusted to reflect a 65% profit sharing distribution to the DLA Disposition Services; (ii) DLA\nDisposition Services may elect to terminate portions of the Scrap Contract by location with a 90-day notification required; and (iii) DLA Disposition Services may elect to terminate portions of the Scrap Contract by certain commodity categories with a 60-day notification required; provided that no such termination shall be effective sooner than October 8, 2015. The contracts were awarded by the DoD through a competitive bidding process, and we may be required to go through a new competitive bidding process when our existing contracts expire. Under the current Surplus Contract, as amended, we are obligated to purchase all DoD surplus property at 1.8% of Disposition Services' original acquisition value (\"OAV\"). The DoD has broad discretion to determine what property will be made available for sale to us under the next Surplus Contract and may retrieve or restrict property previously sold to us for national security reasons or if the property is otherwise needed to support the mission of the DoD. The DoD, in accordance with the award of the next Surplus Contract, split the contract into a rolling stock and a non-rolling stock contract, with bidding on these two surplus contracts held on April 1 and 2, 2014. On April 1, 2014, we were the high bidder for the non-rolling stock surplus contract with a bid equal to 4.35% of the DoD's OAV. The non-rolling stock surplus contract has a base term of two years with four one-year renewal options. Following the bidding event on April 2, 2014 for the DoD rolling stock contract, we withdrew from the live auction bidding for this contract. Bidding reached a level that we determined would be economically unsustainable under the terms of the new contract, jeopardizing the high level of service we have historically provided the agency client. The price that we will pay for inventory under the next Surplus Contract will increase from 1.8% to 4.35% of OAV, resulting in significantly higher Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in fiscal year 2016 and beyond.\nOur Surplus Contract with the DoD allows either party to terminate the contract for convenience. Although our Scrap Contract does not allow the DoD to terminate for convenience, it requires us to meet specified performance benchmarks. The Scrap Contract may be terminated by the DoD if rate of return performance ratios do not exceed specified benchmark ratios for two consecutive quarterly periods and the preceding twelve months. Although, to date, we have never failed to meet the required benchmark ratios during any of the testing periods, we may not meet the performance benchmarks in the future. The DoD also has the right, after giving us notice and a 30-day opportunity to cure, to terminate the contracts and seek other contract remedies in the event of material breaches. We continue to provide services under our existing contract.\nWe expect that there will be significant competition to renew our DoD contracts. We may not win any such competitive solicitation, as one or more providers may offer to provide the same or similar services at a more favorable price. Even if we win the competitive procurement, we could be required to reduce significantly the prices we charge for our services under the new contracts. The failure to win the competitive solicitation or a requirement to provide our services at significantly less favorable prices would materially adversely affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable findings resulting from a government audit or investigation could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions, could negatively impact our future operating results and could force us to adjust previously reported operating results.\nThe federal government has the right to audit our performance under our government contracts. Any adverse findings from audits or reviews of our performance under our contracts could result in a significant adjustment to our previously reported operating results. For example, our DoD Scrap contract provides that we share sales profits with the government. The federal government may disagree with our calculation of the profits realized from the sales of government assets and may require us to increase profit-sharing payments to the government that have been made in the past. If this occurs, our past operating margins may be reduced. The results of an audit by the government could significantly limit the volume and type of merchandise made available to us under our contracts\nwith the DoD, resulting in lower gross merchandise volume, revenue, and profitability for our company. If such a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, administrative sanctions and could suffer serious harm to our reputation. Government and law enforcement agencies may also investigate our other activities under our DoD contracts and our company. If such an investigation alleges that we engaged in improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. federal government agencies. If, as the result of a government audit or investigation, or for any other reason, we are suspended or debarred from contracting with the federal government generally, or any specific agency, if our reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired, or if the government otherwise ceases doing business with us or significantly decreases the amount of business it does with us, our revenue and profitability would substantially decrease.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain a supply of merchandise for our buyers and to attract and retain active professional buyers to create sufficient demand for our sellers.\nOur ability to increase our revenue and maintain profitability depends on whether we can successfully expand the supply of merchandise available for sale on our online marketplaces and attract and retain active professional buyers to purchase the merchandise. Our ability to attract sufficient quantities of suitable merchandise and new buyers will depend on various factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include our ability to:\n\u2022 offer sellers liquid marketplaces for their surplus and salvage assets;\n\u2022 offer buyers a sufficient supply of merchandise;\n\u2022 develop and implement effective sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022 comply with regulatory or corporate seller requirements affecting marketing and disposition of certain categories of merchandise;\n\u2022 efficiently catalogue, handle, store, ship and track merchandise; and\n\u2022 achieve high levels of seller and buyer satisfaction with the trading experience.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nThe online services market for auctioning or liquidating surplus and salvage assets is competitive and growing rapidly. Competitive pressures could affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could decrease our revenue and negatively affect our operating results. We currently compete with:\n\u2022 other e-commerce providers;\n\u2022 auction websites;\n\u2022 government agencies that have created websites to sell surplus and salvage assets; and\n\u2022 traditional liquidators and fixed-site auctioneers.\nWe expect our market to become even more competitive as traditional and online liquidators and auctioneers continue to develop online and offline services for disposition, redeployment and remarketing of surplus and salvage assets. In addition, manufacturers, retailers and government agencies may decide to create their own websites to sell their own surplus and salvage assets and those of third parties.\nSome of our other current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to devote greater financial resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, secure merchandise from sellers on more favorable terms, adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory availability policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we are able to do. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate our acquired businesses and operations and/or fully realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions in the expected time frame, our future operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and operations with our other businesses and fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. If we are not able to achieve these objectives in a cost-effective and timely manner, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or it may take us longer to realize the benefits of the acquisition than we expect. Our acquired operations outside the U.S. may present unique challenges or increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes.\nThe integration process could result in the loss of key customers or key employees, increase our operating or other costs, decrease our profit margins or disrupt our other businesses, each of which could impair our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Our efforts to integrate the acquired businesses will divert management's attention and resources from our other businesses. Any failure to timely realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses and operating results.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in 1999. Although we currently do not have specific plans for any expansion that would require significant capital investment, in the future we plan to expand our operations further by developing new or complementary services, products, or trading formats and enhancing the breadth and depth of our value-added services. We also plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing, technology and client support organizations. In addition, we will likely need to continue to improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to effectively implement these plans and to otherwise manage our expanding operations, we may not be able to execute our business strategy and our operating results could significantly decrease.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur prior operating results have fluctuated due to changes in our business and the e-commerce industry. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u2022 the addition of new buyers and sellers or the loss of existing buyers and sellers;\n\u2022 entry into, or the modification, termination or expiration of, material contracts;\n\u2022 the volume, size, timing and completion rate of transactions in our marketplaces;\n\u2022 changes in the supply and demand for and the volume, price, mix and quality of our supply of surplus and salvage assets;\n\u2022 introduction of new or enhanced websites, services or product offerings by us or our competitors, which may impact our margins;\n\u2022 implementation of significant new contracts;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in the conditions and economic prospects of the e-commerce industry or the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective buyers' and sellers' priorities;\n\u2022 impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022 technical difficulties, including telecommunication system or Internet failures;\n\u2022 changes in government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce industry;\n\u2022 event-driven disruptions such as war, terrorism, disease and natural disasters;\n\u2022 seasonal patterns in selling and purchasing activity; and\n\u2022 costs related to acquisitions of technology or equipment.\nOur operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods. If this occurs, even temporarily, it could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur operating results depend on our websites, network infrastructure and transaction processing systems. Service interruptions or system failures could negatively affect the demand for our services and our ability to grow our revenue.\nAny system interruptions that affect our websites or our transaction systems could impair the services that we provide to our sellers and buyers. In addition, our systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of other sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Improving the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive, reduce our margins and may not be successful in preventing system failures. Our services are also substantially dependent on systems provided by third parties, over whom we have little control. We have occasionally experienced interruptions to our services due to system failures unrelated to our own systems. Any interruptions or failures of our current systems or our ability to communicate with third party systems could negatively affect the demand for our services and our ability to grow our revenue. Although we carry specific insurance against cybersecurity events, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to compensate us for any related losses we incur.\nWe are implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") system as part of our Liquidity One Transformation initiative in order to replace and upgrade our information technology systems and networks used to operate our business. Increasingly, our new information technology systems are outsourced cloud solutions not under our direct management or control. Any system or network disruption resulting from our implementation of new systems or interference with outsourced systems based in the cloud could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and operating results.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed internally within the Company and some of which are outsourced. As part of the Liquidity One Transformation initiative, we are implementing a new ERP system to replace a number of legacy systems. The implementation of our Liquidity One Transformation plan will require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure, which could lead to system interruptions, affect our websites and transaction systems and further expose us to operational disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of Liquidity One Transformation, we have increased our use of Cloud based services and will increasingly do so. Many of these outsourced systems are platform as a service solutions and therefore not under our direct management or control. Any disruption to either those outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier, could negatively impact our ability to operate our websites or our transaction systems and could impair the services that we provide to our sellers and buyers. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.\nIf we do not respond to rapid technological changes or upgrade our systems, we could fail to grow our business and our revenue could decrease.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce business through initiatives like the Liquidity One Transformation initiative. Although we currently do not have specific plans for any upgrades that would require significant capital investment beyond the Liquidity One Transformation, in the future we will need to improve and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure in order to allow our operations to grow in both size and scope. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow transaction processing, unreliable service levels, or impaired quality or delays in reporting accurate financial information, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers. We may also face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements. The Internet and the e-commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and our proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance our business will increase. If we fail to respond to technological change or to adequately maintain, expand, upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure in a timely fashion our ability to grow could be limited and our revenue could decrease.\nShipment of merchandise sold in our marketplaces could be delayed or disrupted by factors beyond our control and we could lose buyers and sellers as a result.\nWe rely upon third party carriers such as United Parcel Services, or UPS, for timely delivery of our merchandise shipments. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including labor difficulties, inclement weather, terrorist activity and increased fuel costs. In addition, we do not have a long-term agreement with UPS or any other third party carriers, and we cannot be sure that our relationship with UPS will continue on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationship with UPS is terminated or impaired or if UPS is unable to deliver merchandise for us, we would be required to use alternative carriers for the shipment of products to our buyers. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, if at all. Potential adverse consequences include:\n\u2022 reduced visibility of order status and package tracking;\n\u2022 delays in merchandise receipt and delivery;\n\u2022 increased cost of shipment; and\n\u2022 reduced shipment quality, which may result in damaged merchandise.\nAny failure to receive merchandise at our distribution centers or deliver products to our buyers in a timely and accurate manner could lead to client dissatisfaction and cause us to lose sellers and buyers.\nA significant interruption in the operations of our customer service system or our distribution centers could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends, to a large degree, on effective customer service and distribution center operations. We currently staff DoD warehouse distribution space, for which we do not incur leasing costs, as well as leased commercial warehouse distribution space. These operations could be harmed by several factors, including any material disruption or slowdown at our distribution centers resulting from labor disputes, changes in the terms of our underlying lease agreements or occupancy arrangements in the case of government provided facilities, telecommunications failures, power or service outages, human error, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other events. In addition, space provided to us by the DoD could be re-configured or reduced as a result of the DoD's Base Realignment and Closure initiative or other infrastructure reduction initiatives.\nIf we fail to accurately predict our ability to sell merchandise in which we take inventory risk and credit risk, our margins may decline as a result of lower sale prices from such merchandise.\nUnder our profit-sharing and purchase model, we purchase merchandise and assume the risk that the merchandise may sell for less than we paid for it. We assume general and physical inventory and credit risk. These risks are especially significant because some of the goods we sell on our websites are characterized by rapid technological change, obsolescence and price erosion, and because we sometimes make large purchases of particular types of inventory. In addition, we do not receive warranties on the goods we purchase and, as a result, we have to resell or dispose of any returned goods. Historically, the number of disposed goods (which includes returned goods that we have not resold) has been less than 2% of the goods we have purchased. To manage our inventory successfully, we need to maintain sufficient buyer demand and sell merchandise for a reasonable financial return. We may miscalculate buyer demand and overpay for the acquired merchandise. In the event that merchandise is not attractive to our buyer base, we may be required to take significant losses resulting from lower sale prices, which could reduce our revenue and margins. For example, under the current (second) Surplus Contract, we are obligated to purchase all DoD surplus property at 1.8% of the original acquisition cost, which varies depending on the type of surplus property being purchased. Under the new non-rolling stock (third) surplus contract, we will be obligated to purchase surplus DoD non-rolling stock at 4.35% of original acquisition cost. Under the Scrap Contract, we acquire scrap property at a per pound price. Declines in commodity prices may also reduce the profit we are able to realize in our scrap business. For example, we may not be able to sell our inventory for amounts above its cost and we may incur a loss in products we handle for our commercial clients. As we grow our business, we may choose to increase the amount of merchandise we purchase directly from sellers, thus resulting in increased inventory levels and related risk. Any such increase would require the use of additional working capital and subject us to the additional risk of incurring losses on the sale of that inventory.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our reputation and negatively impact the growth of our business.\nWe regard our intellectual property, particularly domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions and copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, know-how, information and technology. Despite these protections, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization or independently develop similar intellectual property.\nWe currently are the registered owners of several Internet domain names, including www.liquidation.com, www.govliquidation.com, www.govdeals.com,www.networkintl.com, www.truckcenter.com, www.secondipity.com, and www.go-dove.com. We pursue the registration of our domain names in the U.S. and internationally. We currently do not have any patents or registered copyrights, but we are pursuing patents. Effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade\nsecret and domain name protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation. Our competitors may adopt trade names or domain names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to promote our marketplaces and possibly leading to client confusion. In addition, we could face trade name or trademark or service mark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks, including trademarks or service marks that may incorporate variations of our marketplace names. Any claims related to our intellectual property or client confusion related to our marketplaces could damage our reputation and negatively impact the growth of our business.\nOur inability to use software licensed from third parties or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights could disrupt our business.\nWe use software licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software that we use without charge. We currently use the following open source software: Linux (an operating system), MySQL (database software), PERL (an interpreter), Apache (a web server), and Java and we may in the future use additional open source software. In the future, these licenses to third party software may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to use third-party software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future services or enhancements of existing services, which could impair our business. In addition, the terms of certain open source software licenses may require us to provide modified versions of the open source software, which we develop, if any, or any proprietary software that incorporates all or a portion of the open source software, if any, to others on unfavorable license terms that are consistent with the open source license term. If we are required to license our proprietary software in accordance with the foregoing, our competitors and other third parties could obtain access to our intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nAssertions that we infringe on intellectual property rights of others could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOther parties may assert that we have infringed on their technology or other intellectual property rights. We use internally developed systems and licensed technology to operate our online auction platform and related websites. Third parties could assert intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our internally developed systems or use of licensed third party technology. Third parties also could assert intellectual property infringement claims against parties from whom we license technology. If we are forced to defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel and/or delays in completion of sales. Furthermore, the outcome of a dispute may be that we would need to change technology, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. A switch to different technology could cause interruptions in our business. Internal development of a non-infringing technology may be expensive and time-consuming, if we are able to successfully develop such technology at all. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Incurrence of any of these costs could negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we do not retain our senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management, particularly William P. Angrick, III, our chief executive officer. We do not have key-person insurance on any of our officers or employees. The loss of any member of our existing senior management team could damage key seller relationships, result in the loss of key information, expertise or know-how, lead to unanticipated recruitment and training costs and make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees, we might not be able to sustain our growth.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees, particularly employees with sales, marketing, operations and technology expertise. Competition for employees in our industry is intense. We have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. If we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow our business and revenue.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may need additional funds to finance our operations, as well as to enhance our services, fund our expansion, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses or technologies. However, our business may not generate the cash needed to finance such requirements. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced, and these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to enhance our services, fund our expansion, respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of business opportunities would be significantly limited, and we might need to significantly restrict our operations.\nWe face legal uncertainties relating to the Internet in general and to the e-commerce industry in particular and may become subject to costly government regulation.\nThe laws and regulations related to the Internet and e-commerce are evolving. These laws and regulations relate to issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity and personal privacy could also affect our business. Laws adopted prior to the advent of the Internet may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies and it is not clear how they will apply. Current and future laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and/or decrease the demand for our services.\nOur auction business may be subject to a variety of additional costly government regulations.\nMany states and other jurisdictions have regulations governing the conduct of traditional \"auctions\" and the liability of traditional \"auctioneers\" in conducting auctions, which may apply to online auction services. In addition, certain states have laws or regulations that expressly apply to online auction services. We expect to continue to incur costs in complying with these laws and could be subject to fines or other penalties for any failure to comply with these laws. We may be required to make changes in our business to comply with these laws, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenue, cause us to prohibit the listing of certain items, or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.\nIn addition, the law regarding the potential liability of an online auction service for the activities of its users is not clear. Users of our websites may not always comply with our terms and conditions or with laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions. It is possible that we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for any unlawful activities conducted by sellers or buyers. Any costs we incur as a result of any such allegations, or as a result of actual or alleged unlawful transactions using our marketplaces, or in our efforts to prevent any such transactions, may harm our opportunities for future revenue growth. In addition, any negative publicity we receive\nregarding any such transactions or allegations may damage our reputation, our ability to attract new sellers and buyers and our business.\nCertain categories of merchandise sold on our marketplaces are subject to government restrictions.\nWe sell merchandise, such as scientific instruments, information technology equipment and aircraft parts, that is subject to export control and economic sanctions laws, among other laws, imposed by the United States and other governments. Such restrictions include the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions and embargo laws administered by the Office of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations. These restrictions prohibit us from, among other things, selling property to (1) persons or entities that appear on lists of restricted or prohibited parties maintained by the United States or other governments or (2) countries, regimes, or nationals that are the target of applicable economic sanctions or other embargoes. In addition, for specified categories of property sold under our contracts with the DoD, we are required to (1) obtain an end-use certificate from the prospective buyer describing the nature of the buyer's business, describing the expected disposition and specific end-use of the property, and acknowledging the applicability of pertinent export control and economic sanctions laws and (2) confirm that each buyer has been cleared to purchase export-controlled items.\nWe may incur significant costs or be required to modify our business to comply with these requirements. If we are alleged to have violated any of these laws or regulations we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. federal government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, whether or not true.\nOur business may be harmed if third parties misappropriate our clients' confidential information.\nWe retain highly confidential information on behalf of our clients in our systems and databases. Although we maintain security features in our systems, our operations may be susceptible to hacker interception, break-ins and other disruptions. These disruptions may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our systems. As the Department of Defense is one of our clients, our systems may be especially targeted by such malicious attackers. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand our operations. If any compromise of our security were to occur, we may lose clients and our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed by the misappropriation of confidential client information. The loss of confidential client information could also expose us to the risk of liability and costly litigation. In addition, if there is any perception that we cannot protect our clients' confidential information, we may lose the ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients and our revenue could decline.\nIf we fail to comply with increasing levels of regulation relating to privacy, our business could suffer harm.\nWe are subject to increasing regulation at the federal, state and international levels relating to privacy and the use of personal user information. In addition, several states have proposed or enacted legislation to limit uses of personal information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies. Data protection regulations and enforcement efforts may restrict our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users, which could be costly or harm our marketing efforts. Such regulations, along with increased government or private enforcement, may increase the cost of growing our business and require us to expend significant capital and other resources. Our failure to comply with these federal, state and international laws and regulations could subject us to\nlawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, adverse publicity and other costs could decrease our profitability.\nIf one or more states successfully assert that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise or the merchandise of third parties that we offer for sale on our websites, our business could be harmed.\nWe are currently required to collect and remit sales taxes in all states for shipment of goods from our DoD contracts. We also collect and remit sales or other similar taxes in respect of shipments of other goods into states in which we have a substantial presence. In addition, as we grow our business, any new operation in states in which we currently do not collect and remit sales taxes could subject shipments into such states to state sales taxes under current or future laws.\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local taxes with respect to sales made over the Internet. However, a number of states have adopted or are considering laws that levy additional taxes on Internet access and electronic commerce transactions. Congress is also considering legislation allowing states to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales and use taxes for electronic commerce transactions. It is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of these initiatives or the impact of these initiatives on our business and marketing strategies that we are considering or may consider in the future.\nAn unfavorable change in U.S. Supreme Court guidance related to sales tax, or a successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that our sale of merchandise in such jurisdiction is subject to sales or other taxes may result in material tax liabilities, interest and penalties. A change in state or federal laws, or our business model, business strategy, or marketing initiatives may require us to collect sales tax on transactions in which we do not currently collect such tax. These developments, should they occur, may result in a decrease in future sales, may decrease our ability to compete, increase our compliance costs or otherwise harm our business.\nFraudulent activities involving our websites and disputes relating to transactions on our websites may cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe are aware that other companies operating online auction or liquidation services have periodically received complaints of fraudulent activities of buyers or sellers on their websites, including disputes over the quality of goods and services, unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft, potential breaches of system security, and infringement of third-party copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights. We may receive similar complaints if sellers or buyers trading in our marketplaces are alleged to have engaged in fraudulent or unlawful activity. In addition, we may suffer losses as a result of purchases paid for with fraudulent credit card data even though the associated financial institution approved payment. In the case of disputed transactions, we may not be able to require users of our services to fulfill their obligations to make payments or to deliver goods. We also may receive complaints from buyers about the quality of purchased goods, requests for reimbursement, or communications threatening or commencing legal actions against us. Negative publicity generated as a result of fraudulent conduct by third parties or the failure to satisfactorily settle disputes related to transactions on our websites could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nFalse or defamatory statements transmitted through our services could harm our reputation and affect our ability to attract clients.\nThe law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled. Claims could be made against online services companies under both the U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence,\ncopyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services. Our website allows users to make comments regarding the online auction industry in general and other users and their merchandise in particular. Although all such comments are generated by users and not by us, we are aware that claims of defamation or other injury have been made against other companies operating auction services in the past and could be made in the future against us for comments made by users. If we are held liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service, we could be directly harmed and may be forced to implement measures to reduce our liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or discontinue certain service offerings, which could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation and affect our ability to attract clients.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe worldwide financial crisis led to an increase in the overall volatility of the stock market. Despite improved stock market performance, the increased volatility and other broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Other factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by us or by a securities analyst who covers our stock;\n\u2022 publication of research reports about our company or industry;\n\u2022 conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022 stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those whose business involves the Internet and e-commerce;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts (or the amendment or loss of such contracts), acquisitions, commercial relationships, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements;\n\u2022 announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022 the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us, our clients or our industry;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or specific stockholders; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets.\nVolatility in the market price of shares may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares of common stock at prices they view as attractive. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.\nSome provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law inhibit potential acquisition bids that you may consider favorable.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022 a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022 limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 advance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022 the requirement that board vacancies be filled by a majority of our directors then in office.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 91095, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "LQDT"}
