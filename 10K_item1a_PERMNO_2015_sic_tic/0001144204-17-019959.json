Risk Factors\nIn this report we make, and from time-to-time we may also make, either written or oral statements regarding our business and prospects, such as projections of future performance, statements of management\u2019s plans and objectives, forecasts of market trends, and other matters that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements containing the words or phrases \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which may appear in documents, reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, written or oral presentations made by our officers or other representatives appointed by us to analysts, stockholders, investors, news organizations and others, and may also appear during any discussions between such persons and our management or any of our representatives. For such statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nOur future results, including results related to forward-looking statements, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. No assurance can be given that the results reflected in any forward-looking statements will be achieved. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that are sometimes based upon estimates, data, communications and other information from suppliers, government agencies and other sources that may be subject to revision. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or keep current either: (i) any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of such statement; or (ii) the important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or which are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement.\nIn addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include those set out below.\nWe have a history of operating losses. We recorded a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $5.3 million, $3.9 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We may incur losses in the year ending December 31, 2017 due to our reduced base of operations and the ramp up of the social gaming operations, which remains in the testing phase. Further, we remain subject to the risks inherent in any developing business, including those mentioned below. While we will endeavor to generate positive cash flows from operations and net income, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nDue to the nature of our EGM operations, the actions of our venue owners with which we partner could impact our financial performance. Our EGM operations, which involve the ownership and leasing of EGMs on a revenue-sharing basis in the Philippines, are presently our primary gaming operations. These operations focus on targeting venue owners who have little or no gaming operations experience. Since we participate on a revenue-sharing basis with these venue owners, our revenue generated from these agreements will be dependent to a significant degree on the efforts and capabilities of the venue owners. Our revenues and results from the EGM operations may be impacted by the ability of the venue owners to manage the gaming operations of their venues. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that the venue owners will be able to manage the gaming operations successfully or that the gaming venues operated by them will perform at levels consistent with our financial projections and underlying forecasts and assumptions. Further, we have limited past business relationships with certain of the venue owners and, despite background checks and other due diligence that we may perform, the venue owners may not be reputable. In the event that any of the venue owners are not reputable, this would expose us to the risk of being unable to collect the revenue to which we are entitled under the revenue-sharing arrangements and protect our gaming machine assets.\nOur gaming operations are presently located in the Philippines, which means our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic or political developments in this country. Our EGM operations in the Philippines are currently the only operations generating positive cash flows. Therefore, we experience significant exposure to the business concentration risks presented by the economies and regulatory environments of the Philippines. The government of the Philippines exercises substantial control over virtually every sector of the country\u2019s economy through regulations and, in some cases, state-ownership. Our ability to operate in the Philippines may be harmed by changes in the local laws and regulations, including those relating to gaming, taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. With the exception of major integrated resorts in the Manila area, almost all gaming operations are controlled by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), a government corporation that holds the exclusive right to operate slot rooms in the Philippines, which reports directly to the Office of the President of the Philippines. While we have no reason to believe at this time any of our gaming operations or partners are facing the risk of any adverse government action in the Philippines, the central or local governments may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure compliance with such regulations or interpretations or which may even restrict the licenses under which we and our partners operate. Likewise, any political turmoil, adverse weather condition, calamity or epidemic occurs in the Philippines would have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial performance.\nOur EGM contracts operate under varying terms and are subject to renewal risk. Our EGM contracts operate under varying contract durations. When permitted and if we choose to renew contracts with certain venue owners or, in the case of one venue in the Philippines, with PAGCOR, there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these contracts under similar conditions, if at all. Contracts for our two venues in the Philippines expire on June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Absent significant improvement in our social gaming operations and/or securing new successful projects, the loss of any contracts that are material contributors to our earnings, would have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nWe could require additional funding in the future to secure and execute on new projects. As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital of approximately $33.5 million. Since December 31, 2016, working capital has been negatively impacted by operating losses due to increasing costs incurred for the continued development and testing of the social gaming platform and corporate overhead.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash on hand to fulfill all current obligations as they become due and to fund the development and testing of the social gaming platform, equipment purchase plans and maintenance for our existing operations over the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital within the next 12 months if we were to: commit to a large or multiple, smaller concurrent projects; experience a shortfall in internal earnings projections; or require capital for reasons not currently contemplated. We would endeavor to raise funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity and debt securities and the procurement of commercial debt financing. However, there can be no guarantee that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand or continue our business as desired and operating results may be adversely affected. Any debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the following results can occur:\n\u00b7 the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced;\n\u00b7 our stockholders may experience further dilution in net book value per share; and/or\n\u00b7 the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nOur gaming operations business is focused in markets outside the United States, which expose us to risks inherent in international business operations. Our international operations, specifically in the Philippines, expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u00b7 increased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 localization of our EGMs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u00b7 compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 laws favoring local competitors;\n\u00b7 weaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u00b7 market disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States, such as Avian flu, SARS and other diseases;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions; and\n\u00b7 changing regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nSocial gaming is a new business model for us, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. In October 2015, we commenced efforts to develop a social gaming platform specifically for Pan-Asia. While we have hired experienced professionals to internally develop the platform, this is a new business operation for us which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. We expect to commit material resources to the development, distribution and ongoing support of the platform and its applications and there is no guarantee they will be successfully launched or well received in the market place. The applications will be based on offering games that are free to play and only a small portion of our players may pay for our products. We cannot assure that any of our efforts will be successful or result in the development or timely launch of our platform, or ultimately produce any material revenue. Further, we remain subject to the risks inherent in any developing business, including those mentioned herein. Some of our assumptions will invariably not materialize and some unanticipated events and circumstances may affect other assumptions. Therefore, the actual results achieved may vary from the pro forma projections considered by management, and the variations may be material.\nOur social gaming business will suffer if we are unable to develop and launch successful games for mobile platforms and successfully monetize those games. Our ability to successfully develop games for mobile platforms and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend on our ability to:\n\u00b7 partner with desired mobile platforms in Pan-Asia under favorable terms, if at all, and obtain featured marketing opportunities;\n\u00b7 obtain and comply with regulatory requirements concerning the exploitation and distribution of social casino games, specifically in our target markets in Pan-Asia;\n\u00b7 compete against monopolistic and IP infringement practices of competing foreign game publishers;\n\u00b7 secure licensing agreements for game content on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 effectively market mobile games to players and retain those players without excess user acquisition costs;\n\u00b7 achieve viral organic growth;\n\u00b7 adapt to changing player preferences;\n\u00b7 adapt games quickly to make sure they are compatible with the ever changing mobile device market;\n\u00b7 attract and retain talented game designers and engineers who have experience developing games for mobile platforms;\n\u00b7 adapt game feature sets for limited bandwidth, processing power and screen size of typical mobile devices;\n\u00b7 minimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of new games;\n\u00b7 effectively monetize the games;\n\u00b7 maintain quality social game experience;\n\u00b7 provide a compelling and optimal user experience through existing and developing third-party technologies, including third-party software and middleware utilized by our partners;\n\u00b7 compete successfully against a large and growing number of existing market participants; and\n\u00b7 minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages.\nFurther, as a new entrant in the mobile game market, we may have difficulty predicting the development schedule of new games and forecasting their bookings. If launches are delayed and we are unable to monetize mobile games in the manner that we forecast, our ability to grow revenue and our financial performance will be negatively impacted.\nOur social gaming business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, some of which are still developing or unsettled and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. Our social gaming business is subject to a variety of foreign and domestic regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer protection, electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, taxation, intellectual property, export and national security, and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, and could have an adverse effect on our business or expose us to liabilities. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, labeling of free-to-play games and regulations on money transmission may be interpreted to cover our social games and the virtual currency, goods or payments that we receive. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nIn addition, there are ongoing academic, political and regulatory discussions in the U.S., Australia and other jurisdictions regarding whether social casino applications should be subject to a higher levels or different types of regulations than other social game applications to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction to social games. If new social gaming regulations are imposed, our social gaming business may become subject to the rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties if we do not comply. Heightened scrutiny could increase the cost of running our social games such as responding to the lawsuits against us, decrease our user base or otherwise harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and agreements with third parties throughout Pan-Asia. Our activities in Pan-Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Our success in business, in particular in relation to our social gaming platform, is impacted by maintaining the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete may be damaged and our revenues may be reduced if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. To protect these rights, we rely principally on a combination of:\nPatent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws provide limited protection. The protections provided by laws governing intellectual property rights do not prevent competitors from developing, independently, products similar or superior to our products and technologies. In addition, circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective protection of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other proprietary rights may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which our products are distributed. We may be unaware of certain non-publicly available patent applications, which, if issued as patents, could relate to our services and products as currently designed or as we may modify them in the future. Legal or regulatory proceedings to enforce our patents, trademarks or copyrights could be costly, time consuming, and could divert the attention of management and technical personnel. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business, thereby harming our operating results.\nCompanies in the internet, games, social media, technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request licensing agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we will infringe their copyrights, trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights.\nMelco International Development Ltd. through its subsidiary EGT Entertainment Holding Limited, is a majority owner of our common stock, giving Melco control over our management and all shareholder actions. EGT Entertainment, a Hong Kong corporation indirectly wholly-owned by Melco, a Hong Kong corporation listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, is our majority owner with approximately 64.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. EGT Entertainment and Melco, as the indirect majority owner, have the ability to elect all members of our board of directors and approve (or defeat) all matters that come before the stockholders for approval.\nAs a result of Melco\u2019s indirect majority ownership of our Company, we have become a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, thereby allowing us to elect out of certain corporate governance requirements mandated by the NASDAQ. As a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d, within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, we can elect out of certain corporate governance requirements of Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules that would otherwise require us to have:\n\u00b7 A majority of independent directors on the board of directors;\n\u00b7 Compensation of our executive officers determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7 Director nominees selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors.\nAll other corporate governance requirements under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules continue to apply.\nWe have elected to take advantage of our \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status and have elected out of the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors. On March 5, 2015, our board of directors appointed Dennis (Chi Wai) Tam to serve on the board. Mr. Tam currently serves as the Group Finance Director and Head of Human Resources & Administration of Melco and, therefore, is not considered to be an independent director within the meaning of NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. With Mr. Tam\u2019s appointment to our board of directors, we have six members of our board of directors, of which three, or 50%, have been determined by our board of directors to be independent under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As of the date of this report, we do not intend to elect out of any other corporate governance requirements under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that a fully liquid market will develop or be sustained. Our common shares are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cEGT\u201d. However, we consider our common stock to be \u201cthinly traded\u201d and any last reported sale prices may not be a true market-based valuation of the common stock. Also, the present volume of trading in our common stock may not provide investors sufficient liquidity in the event you wish to sell your common shares. There can be no assurance that an active market for our common stock will develop. In addition, the stock market in general, and lower market cap public companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. If we are unable to develop a fully liquid market for our common shares, you may not be able to sell your common shares at prices you consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for you, or at all.\nOur board of directors may issue blank check preferred stock, which may affect the voting rights of our holders and could deter or delay an attempt to obtain control of us. The board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in series and to fix and state the voting rights and powers, designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. Preferred stock may rank prior to our common stock with respect to dividends rights, liquidation preferences, or both, and may have full or limited voting rights. Accordingly, issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock and could have the effect of deterring or delaying an attempt to obtain control of us.", "PERMNO": 90176, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "EGT"}
