{"cik": "831259", "company": "FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis report contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold and molybdenum price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments; and share purchases and sales.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:\nFinancial risks\nDeclines in the market prices of copper and molybdenum have adversely affected our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, may adversely affect our ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock.\nOur financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. As described below, beginning in 2015, copper prices declined significantly, before recovering in fourth-quarter 2016. If prices decline in the future, they may have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations; and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.\nIn response to market-conditions, beginning in the second half of 2015, we made adjustments to operating plans for our mining operations, including reducing operating and capital costs and adjusting production at our North America copper mines; reducing mining and stacking rates at our El Abra mine in Chile by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs, defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the operation; and operating the Henderson molybdenum mine in Colorado at reduced rates. If market prices for our primary commodities decline or persist at low levels, we may have to further revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur additional losses, and those losses may be material.\nFluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and tax policies; commodities investment activity and speculation; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology.\nCopper prices may be affected by demand from China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. Copper prices declined significantly during 2015 and remained low throughout most of 2016, with London Metal Exchange (LME) spot copper prices averaging $2.21 per pound in 2016, $2.49 per pound in 2015 and $3.11 per pound in 2014. During fourth-quarter 2016, copper prices improved, with the LME spot price averaging $2.39 per pound. The LME spot copper price was $2.50 per pound on December 31, 2016, and $2.73 per pound on February 15, 2017.\nFactors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world\u2019s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. The London PM gold price averaged $1,250 per ounce in 2016, $1,160 per ounce in 2015 and $1,266 per ounce in 2014. The London PM gold price was $1,224 per ounce on February 15, 2017.\nMolybdenum prices also declined significantly during 2015 and have remained low throughout 2016, with the Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price averaging $6.47 per pound in 2016, $6.66 per pound in 2015 and $11.41 per pound in 2014. The Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price was $7.59 per pound on February 15, 2017.\nLower copper and molybdenum prices during 2016 and 2015 resulted in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments ($36 million for the year 2016 and $338 million for the year 2015) and long-lived mining asset impairments ($37 million for the year 2015). Refer to Notes 4 and 5 for additional information. Declines in copper and/or molybdenum prices could result in additional metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. Other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on mine production costs.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2016, our total consolidated debt was $16.0 billion (see Note 8) and our total consolidated cash was $4.2 billion. We also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. Our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nRequiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.\nAny failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default.\nFrom August 2015 through November 2016, we sold 326.5 million shares of our common stock under registered at-the-market equity programs, which generated $3.5 billion in gross proceeds (refer to Note 10). In addition, during 2016, we issued 48.1 million shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts (refer to Note 13) and 27.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for $369 million of FCX senior notes (refer to Note 10). Any additional issuance of equity capital to fund operations, reduce debt, improve our financial position or for other purposes, may have a negative impact on our stock price.\nAs of February 15, 2017, our senior unsecured debt was rated \"BB-\" with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), \"BBB-\" with a negative outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and \"B1\" with a positive outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody's). There is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. For more information, refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas operations.\nMine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations. Changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or similar state laws. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations.\nWith respect to our mining operations, most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. Although Section 108(b) of CERCLA has required EPA to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility since it was adopted in 1980, currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under CERCLA. In August 2014, several environmental organizations initiated litigation against EPA to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under CERCLA governing the hard rock mining industry. EPA and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for approval. Notwithstanding industry objections, the court approved the agreement on January 29, 2016, thereby requiring the EPA to propose financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry by December 1, 2016, and to provide notice of its final action by December 1, 2017. The proposed regulations were published on January 11, 2017, subject to a 60-day comment period. The proposed rules, if promulgated without material modification, would result in onerous financial responsibility obligations for our U.S. hard rock mining operations, and the form, cost and availability of financial mechanisms necessary to meet such obligations is uncertain (if they could be met at all). In addition, complying with these obligations could be very costly, harm the international competitiveness of our U.S. hard rock mining operations and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws, including financial responsibility required under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. In 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging, abandoning, decommissioning and/or removing wells, platforms and pipelines at the end of production. The revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security. The new requirements to post significant amounts of security in the form of bonds or similar assurances could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. The cost for bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.1 billion for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of U.S. mining sites, and $0.7 billion for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas operations (refer to Note 12). A substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by FCX guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. As a result of the downgrade of our credit ratings on our debt to below investment grade by S&P and Moody\u2019s, we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. These other forms of assurance are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.\nRefer to Notes 1 and 12, for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations.\nUnanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and its affiliates, including those described in\nNote 12 and in Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" involving matters such as remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead, arsenic, asbestos, talc and other allegedly toxic substances, disputes over water rights, and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties, taxes, rights and obligations under concession or other agreements, or other matters. We are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition, from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.\nWith respect to the asbestos exposure cases described in Note 12, there has been an increase in the number of cases against FMC and its affiliates alleging exposure to talc contaminated with asbestos and to talc that is not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. Recently, there have been a limited number of large jury awards in single plaintiff cases primarily brought by consumers against makers of common consumer products containing talc and alleging serious health risks, including ovarian cancer associated with long-term use of such products. Prior affiliates were involved in talc mining, and some of those affiliates have been named as defendants in some of those cases. We have indemnification rights against a successor to those businesses, and the successor has acknowledged those indemnification obligations and has taken responsibility for all cases we have tendered to it. However, the indemnitor may have limited financial resources and limited amounts of insurance available to meet those obligations.\nInternational risks\nOur international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S.\nWe are a U.S.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru and Chile. Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the U.S., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. Risks of conducting business in countries outside of the U.S. include:\n\u2022\nRenegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\nExpropriation or nationalization of property;\n\u2022\nChanges in the host country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, which because of rising \"resource nationalism\" in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022\nChanges in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs;\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. trade, tax, immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;\n\u2022\nForeign exchange controls and movements in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nThe risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory.\nOur insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. There has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years, and a steadily increasing focus on enforcement of those laws continues. Any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the Indonesian and Peruvian tax authorities (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these matters). Other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.\nBecause our Grasberg mining operation in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.\nOur mining operations in Indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) pursuant to a Contract of Work (COW) with the Indonesian government. Maintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among Indonesia's most significant business enterprises. Partially because of their significance to Indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the Indonesian press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. For further discussion of the history of PT-FI's COW, refer to Note 13.\nThe initial term of PT-FI's COW expires in 2021, but the COW explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. PT-FI has been engaged in discussions with officials of the Indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its COW, including extending its term. Notwithstanding provisions in the COW prohibiting it from doing so, the Indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts, including PT-FI\u2019s COW, to address provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009; and mining regulations adopted thereunder, including provisions that conflict with the COW, such as the size of contract concessions, government revenues, domestic processing of minerals, divestment, provision of local goods and services, conversion from a COW to a licensing framework for extension periods, and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a COW\u2019s expiration.\nRegulations published in January 2014 imposed, among other things, a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes (a by-product of the copper refining process containing metals, including gold) after January 12, 2017. Despite PT-FI\u2019s rights under its COW to export concentrate without the payment of duties, PT-FI was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-January 2014 through July 2014.\nIn July 2014, PT-FI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Indonesian government, in which, subject to concluding an agreement to extend PT-FI's operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms, PT-FI agreed to construct new smelter capacity in Indonesia and to divest an additional 20.64 percent interest at fair value. Under the MOU, PT-FI provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to pay higher royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met. The MOU also anticipated an amendment of the COW within six months to address other matters; however, no terms of the COW other than those relating to the smelter bond, increased royalties and export duties were changed. In January 2015, the MOU was extended to July 25, 2015, and it expired on that date. The Indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates, export duties and smelter assurance bond.\nIn October 2015, the Indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to PT-FI indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of PT-FI's operations beyond 2021, and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current COW.\nIn January and February 2017, the Indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. The new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a five-year period through January 2022, subject to various conditions, including conversion from a contract of work to a special operating license (known as an IUPK, which provides virtually none of the protections of a contract of work), commitment to completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the new regulations enable application for extension of operating rights five years before expiration of the IUPK and require foreign IUPK holders to divest 51 percent to Indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production. Export licenses would be valid for one-year periods, subject to review every six months, depending on smelter construction progress.\nThe January 2017 regulations permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for PT Smelting (PTFI\u2019s 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in Gresik, Indonesia) to continue operating. PT Smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license; however, we cannot predict when PT Smelting\u2019s anode slimes export license may be renewed. In addition, a labor strike at PT Smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since January 19, 2017. Although PT-FI is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at PT Smelting, or approximately 40 percent of PT-FI's concentrate production capacity, on February 10, 2017, PT-FI was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at PT-FI and PT Smelting. PT Smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in March 2017. Delays in PT Smelting obtaining its anode slimes export license or restarting operations could further impact PT-FI's operations.\nFollowing the issuance of the January and February 2017 regulations and discussions with the government, PT-FI advised the Indonesian government that it was prepared to convert its COW to an IUPK, subject to obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under its COW, and provided that the COW would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative. PT-FI also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five-year timeframe after approval of the extension of its long-term operating rights.\nUnder its COW, PT-FI has specified rights to export copper concentrate without restriction or payment of export duties. PT-FI has requested that concentrate exports be permitted without the imposition of export duties while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated. The Indonesia government has indicated that in order to export its concentrate production, PT-FI would be required to immediately convert to an IUPK, forgo its current rights to fiscal and legal certainty and commit to a new smelter prior to completing a long-term investment stability agreement. PT-FI has advised the Indonesian government that attempts to enforce the new regulations on PT-FI violates its COW and that it is unwilling to terminate its COW unless replaced by a mutually acceptable form of agreement providing fiscal and legal assurances to support its long-term investment plans in Papua, Indonesia.\nAs of February 24, 2017, PT-FI has not obtained approval to export concentrate and production remains suspended. PT-FI is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at PT Smelting, or approximately 40 percent of PT-FI's concentrate production capacity (assuming that PT Smelting's export license is approved and its operations are resumed in March 2017). PT-FI has begun to significantly adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and spending with local suppliers, and suspend investments in its underground development projects and new smelter.\nOn February 17, 2017, pursuant to the COW\u2019s dispute resolution provisions, PT-FI provided formal notice to the Indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government\u2019s breaches and violations of the COW as described in the risk factor below \u201cPT-FI's COW may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel.\u201d\nWe cannot predict whether or when PT-FI will be able to resume exporting copper concentrate. For each month of delay in obtaining approval to export, PT-FI\u2019s share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold. The inability of either PT-FI to export copper concentrate, or PT Smelting to export anode slimes or restart operations, for any extended period of time would lead to the\ncontinued suspension of production in Indonesia, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves.\nWe also cannot predict whether PT-FI will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its long-term mining rights. If PT-FI is unable to reach agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects, which would have a material adverse effect on our future production, cash flow, results of operations and financial position, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves.\nIn October 2016, a new Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources was appointed, and is the fourth person to hold the office since July 2016. We cannot predict what impact the transition will have on the progress or outcome of PT-FI\u2019s license and stability agreement negotiations.\nPT-FI's COW may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel.\nPT-FI's COW was entered into under Indonesia's 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. The COW may be subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements.\nRecently adopted Indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the COW. Although the COW grants to PT-FI the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the COW, government agencies have sought and continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on PT-FI that could affect exploration and operating requirements. For further discussion, refer to the above risk factor \"Because our Grasberg mining operation in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.\"\nPT-FI's COW requires that disputes with the Indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. On February 17, 2017, pursuant to the COW\u2019s formal dispute resolution provisions, PT-FI provided formal notice to the Indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government\u2019s breaches and violations of the COW, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nRestrictions on PT-FI\u2019s basic right to export mining products in violation of the COW;\n\u2022\nImposition of export duties other than those taxes and other charges expressly provided for in the COW;\n\u2022\nImposition of surface water taxes in excess of the restrictions imposed by the COW (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these assessments);\n\u2022\nRequirement for PT-FI to build a smelter, while such requirements are not contained in the COW;\n\u2022\nUnreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive ten-year extensions of the term of the COW; and\n\u2022\nImposition of divestment requirements that are not provided for in the COW.\nIf the dispute is not resolved by June 17, 2017, PT-FI may commence arbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules to enforce all provisions of the COW and seek damages, specifically in respect of the issuance of the January 11, 2017, regulations which are not in accordance with honoring the contractual commitments of the Indonesian government and PT-FI under the COW. The arbitration proceedings would take place in Jakarta, Indonesia, and for limited purposes, would be overseen by the Indonesian courts under the Indonesian Arbitration Act. The international arbitration process is complex and could take considerable time to complete and there is no assurance that we will prevail. If we prevail, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against Indonesia within its own territory. Additionally, our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending.\nAt times, certain government officials and others in Indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the Indonesian government prior to May 1998 (i.e., during the Suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including PT-FI's COW, which was signed in December 1991. We cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the COW will not be challenged for political or other reasons.\nWe will not mine all of our ore reserves in Indonesia before the initial term of our COW expires.\nOur proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current COW. Prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 17 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2016, representing 22 percent of PT-FI's share of recoverable copper reserves and 33 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves. There can be no assurance that the Indonesian government will approve our COW extensions. For further discussion, refer to the above risk factors \"Because our Grasberg mining operation in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia\" and \"PT-FI's COW may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel.\"\nOperational risks\nOur mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business.\nOur mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, and other natural disasters; equipment failures; accidents; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates.\nThe waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. We maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large dams that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks, as discussed below.\nThe failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life, and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective, safe management of all those facilities. The importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life. As a member company of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we intend to augment our existing practices to be consistent with the ICMM\u2019s Tailings Governance Framework adopted in December 2016 in an effort to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities.\nLabor unrest, activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately half of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately one third of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2017, including the agreement covering employees at our PT-FI operations in Indonesia.\nLabor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we\nmay incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. Refer to Items 1. and 2., \"Business and Properties,\" for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements.\nWe could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. For example, in October 2014, a large percentage of Grasberg open-pit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts and during third-quarter 2016, PT-FI experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage that began in late September 2016. These labor productivity issues have continued during fourth-quarter 2016 and early 2017, and could be heightened by the workforce reductions that began in February 2017. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesian military. In addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations.\nIn 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. The shooting incidents have continued on a sporadic basis with the last incident occurring on January 1, 2015. During this time, there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. To date, no one person or group has claimed responsibility for the shootings. The safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesian government to address security issues. The investigation of these incidents is ongoing. We also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys.\nWe cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our Indonesian operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time.\nOur mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies.\nOur mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Most of our North and South America mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies.\nIn Arizona, where our operations use both surface and ground water, we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River, one of the state's largest river systems, which primarily affects our Morenci, Safford and Sierrita mines. The adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to \"reasonable use.\" However, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation, as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims, which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding.\nWater for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation. As a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our Cerro Verde operations. In January 2016, the Peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the Rio Chili Basin because of drought conditions. As a result, the Cerro Verde water rights from the Rio Chili were temporarily decreased during February 2016.\nWater for our El Abra mining operation in Chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. The agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. If impact occurs, we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from El Abra.\nAlthough we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesian operations, lower rainfall resulting from El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions affected operations in the second half of 2015 and may do so again in the future.\nAlthough each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings, the outcome of which we cannot predict, and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain. While we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supples, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.\nIn addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and on unusually difficult terrain.\nThe Grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. In addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. The mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster.\nUnderground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in May 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at PT-FI when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed. PT-FI temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the Grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities on June 24, 2013, and underground operations on July 9, 2013. No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.\nWe must continually replace reserves depleted by production, but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.\nOur existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. Because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. Our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nDevelopment projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.\nConsolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate $1.8 billion for 2017, including $1.1 billion for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities at Grasberg and $0.7 billion for sustaining capital. Refer to the risk factor \"Because our Grasberg mining operation in Indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia\" for further discussion of regulatory matters in Indonesia that may impact future investments in PT-FI's underground development projects.\nThere are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or timing can adversely affect project economics.\nNew development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. The actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. These regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a natural resource company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. For additional information, see \"Environmental risks\" below. We are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. In the U.S., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred. If such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures.\nMany other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental risks\nOur operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities.\nOur operations, both in the U.S. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; well plug and abandonment requirements; protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.\nOur Miami, Arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. EPA regulations require us to invest in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of Arizona to demonstrate compliance with EPA's SO2 ambient air quality standards. The deadline for the smelter to install the SO2 pollution\ncontrol equipment to comply with the regional haze rules is January 1, 2018. Arizona regulators have promulgated rules for complying with the national ambient air quality standards, which must be approved by the EPA to become effective, but it is possible that they will be effective prior to January 1, 2018. In order to meet both regulatory requirements, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $250 million, and we expect those expenditures to be made through 2018. If these expenditures are delayed or deferred for technical, financial or any other reasons, we may be forced to curtail production at the Miami smelter, which would require us to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid that would otherwise be generated during the smelting process, which would result in increased production costs.\nLaws such as CERCLA and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. As discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by FMC and certain of its affiliates. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors.\nNew or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above. In addition, in 2015, the EPA promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as \"hazardous waste\" under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements. These rules are currently being challenged by multiple parties in court; however, if the legal challenges are unsuccessful, and the regulatory agencies reclassify certain mineral processing materials as \u201chazardous waste,\" costs at our U.S. copper and molybdenum processing facilities could materially increase.\nThe EPA has also adopted rules that bring remote \u201ctributaries\u201d into the regulatory definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that are protected by the Clean Water Act, thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land uses, and is in many ways aggressively attempting to expand its regulatory authority over air quality, water quality and solid wastes, among other things. These rules are being litigated by multiple parties. Regulations are also being considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning, and to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. Adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities.\nIn February 2016, the Department of the Interior's Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of \"critical habitat\" and \"destruction or adverse modification,\" both of which are integral to the FWS's implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which protects federally-listed endangered and threatened species. The new rules increase FWS's discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future, or that are occasionally used by protected species. The new rules may limit the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations.\nWe incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.4 billion in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2017, we expect to incur approximately $0.6 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs, which includes expenditures for the Miami smelter pollution control equipment discussed above. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.\nWe incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.\nFMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.\nWith the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. At December 31, 2016, we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 26 U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $1.2 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities. Our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:\n\u2022\nOur knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;\n\u2022\nOur beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and\n\u2022\nOur beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.\nSignificant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.\nIn addition, remediation standards imposed by the EPA and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.\nOur Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.\nMining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the\nore that we mine. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.\nAnother major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. In addition, overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area; this additional material, while predicted in our environmental studies, influences the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary.\nFrom time to time, certain Indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.\nCarbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, and our revenues include sales of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and other carbon-based energy products. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. As a result of the Paris Agreement reached during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, a number of governments have pledged \"Nationally Determined Contributions\" to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., EPA has finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing power plants. While these rules are being challenged in court, increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs.\nOther risks\nOur holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. Cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, to repay any subordinated loan we may make to such subsidiary unless specified conditions are met, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders.\nOur rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nLimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nRequire the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.\nThese provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81774, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "FCX"}
