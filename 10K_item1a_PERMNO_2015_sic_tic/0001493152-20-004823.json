{"cik": "701719", "company": "Envela Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2019, we employed 135 people, all full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our current employee relations are good. Our management policy is to keep employees informed of material decisions that affect them, encourage employee suggestions, and implement them whenever practicable.\nIMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nEnvela recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce its climatic impact. Nevertheless, management believes that climate change has only a limited influence on Envela\u2019s performance and is of limited significance to the business.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nEnvela files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Such information, and amendments to reports previously filed or furnished, is available free of charge from our corporate website, www.envela.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet site at www.sec.gov that contains the Company\u2019s filings.\nAdditionally, there are complete copies of our policies (Business Conduct and Ethic; Related Person Transactions; and Whistleblower), committee charters (Audit; Compliance, Governance and Nominating; and Compensation), and information about how to communicate with our Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d).\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nYou should carefully review and consider the risks described below and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K before evaluating our business or making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Additional risks which we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on our business. Please also see the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1.\nThe voting power in our company is substantially controlled by a small number of stockholders, which may, among other things, delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or a takeover attempt, even if such events may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nN10TR, LLC (\u201cN10TR\u201d) purchased all of the outstanding shares owned by Truscott Capital on May 20, 2019 and is now our largest shareholder, owning 12,814,727 shares of our Common Stock, representing 47.7% of our total outstanding shares of Common Stock. Eduro Holdings, LLC (\u201cEduro\u201d) owns 6,365,460 shares of our Common Stock, representing 23.7% of our total outstanding shares of Common Stock. Consequently, N10TR and Eduro are in a position to significantly influence any matters that are brought to a vote of the shareholders, including, but not limited to, the election of members of our Board and any action requiring the approval of shareholders, including any amendments to our governing documents, mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership also may delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of N10TR and Eduro. These transactions might include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of Common Stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nPART I\nItem 1A\nIn Fiscal 2014, we came to an agreed settlement with the SEC, stemming from an investigation of accounting irregularities. As part of this settlement we agreed to a series of corporate governance reforms, which were independently verified in Fiscal 2015. If we do not comply with the corporate governance reforms, we could face additional enforcement actions by the SEC or other governmental or regulatory bodies, as well as additional shareholder lawsuits, all of which could have significant negative financial or operational implications.\nOn April 16, 2012, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that our Board had determined the existence of certain accounting irregularities beginning approximately during the second calendar quarter of 2007 and continuing in periods subsequent thereto (the \u201cAccounting Irregularities\u201d). We brought the Accounting Irregularities to the attention of the SEC in a letter dated April 16, 2012. On June 18, 2012, we received written notice that the SEC had initiated a private investigation into the Accounting Irregularities, to determine whether any persons or entities had engaged in any possible violations of the federal securities laws. On June 2, 2014, we received notice of the entry of an agreed final judgment by the Honorable Judge Jane Boyle (the \u201cAgreed Final Judgment\u201d) in Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-01909-B, entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. DGSE Companies Inc., et. al., filed on May 27, 2014 in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \u201cCivil Action\u201d). We consented to the Agreed Final Judgment prior to the filing of the Civil Action by the SEC. The Agreed Final Judgment was entered in connection with the conclusion of the investigation against DGSE by the SEC regarding the Accounting Irregularities.\nIn connection with the Agreed Final Judgment and as remedial measures in connection with the Accounting Irregularities, we agreed to undertake certain corporate governance reforms, all of which we believe to be complete at this time (the \u201cCorporate Governance Reforms\u201d). The Corporate Governance Reforms include the appointment of two new independent directors to the Board, establishing the position of a Lead Independent Director on the Board and establishing reasonable term limits for members of the Board, among other reforms. We engaged a consultant satisfactory to the SEC to confirm implementation of the Corporate Governance Reforms. Due to Board member resignations in the latter half of Fiscal 2015, we were unable to complete our confirmation with the consultant by the initial deadline; however, with the addition of new independent directors, we regained compliance with the Corporate Governance Reforms. If we fall out of compliance with the Corporate Governance Reforms, we may be the subject of additional enforcement actions and further lawsuits, which could be debilitating. The costs of such investigations and of defending lawsuits could be significant and could exceed the amount of any available insurance coverage we have, and we may not have sufficient resources in the future to satisfy such costs. These matters may continue for some time, and we have no way of anticipating when or how they may be resolved. As a result of the investigation and settlement, as well as any future investigations or lawsuits, we could face loss of reputation, decline in confidence from investors, fall in the market price for our shares, inability to acquire capital and failure to continue as a going concern.\nIn the past, our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures related thereto have been deficient. Although we have taken significant remedial measures, our previous deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our investors\u2019 confidence in our reported financial information, and there is no guarantee that our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures will not fail in the future.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. In the past, our internal controls and procedures have failed. The remedial measures taken by us may not be sufficient to regain the confidence of investors or any loss of reputation, which could in turn affect our finances and operations. Our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our business have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. If there is a failure in any of our internal controls and procedures, we could face investigation or enforcement actions by the SEC and other governmental and regulatory bodies, litigation, loss of reputation and investor confidence, inability to acquire capital and other material adverse effects on our finances and business operations.\nPART I\nItem 1A\nThe market for precious metals is inherently unpredictable.\nBullion and scrap products are purchased and sold based on current market pricing for precious metals. Bullion and scrap inventories are subject to market-value changes created by their underlying commodity markets. We periodically enter into futures contracts to hedge our exposure against market-price changes. There are several national and international factors which are beyond our control, but which may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion business. These factors include, but are not limited to, the policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, and governmental and private mint supply. If we misjudge the commodity markets underlying the bullion inventory, our bullion business could suffer adverse consequences. Substantially lower precious-metal prices could negatively affect our ability to continue purchasing significant volumes of precious-metal scrap products, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. or in other key markets, and the resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer confidence and spending, including, but not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions; wages and employment levels; volatility in the stock market; home values; inflation; consumer-debt levels; availability and cost of consumer credit; economic uncertainty; solvency concerns of major financial institutions; fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates; fuel and energy costs and/or shortages; tax issues; and general political conditions, both domestic and abroad.\nAdverse economic conditions, including declines in employment levels, disposable income, consumer confidence and economic growth, could result in decreased consumer spending that would adversely affect sales of consumer goods, particularly those viewed as discretionary items like many of our products. Adverse economic conditions may arise from general economic factors as well as events such as war, terrorism, natural disasters or outbreaks of disease, as in the case of the coronavirus pandemic which has already adversely affected global economic business conditions. In addition, if any of these events should occur, future sales on products like ours could decline due to increased commodities prices, particularly gold.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our business, customers and supply chain.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of the coronavirus COVID-19 had become pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. There is a possibility of widespread infection in the United States and abroad. National, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain. Some economists are predicting the United States will soon enter a recession.\nThe sweeping nature of the coronavirus pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business and operations will be affected in the long term, though the likely overall economic impact of the pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the general economy. While it remains a developing situation, any continuing quarantines, interruptions in travel and business disruptions with respect to us, our customers or our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, costs and liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. We may also become subject to store closures. Although we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on our business, the ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. The duration of any such impact cannot be predicted.\nPART I\nItem 1A\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with numerous other companies, many of which are larger and have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources. Our products compete on a number of bases, including attractive brand and category assortments, as well as competitive pricing. Significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect our operations through a decrease in the number and dollar volume of sales.\nFor all of our products and services, we compete with a number of comparably sized and smaller firms, as well as a number of larger firms throughout the United States. Many of our competitors can attract customers with their reputation and through their industry connections. Additionally, other reputable companies may decide to enter our markets to compete with us. These companies may have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. If these companies are successful in entering the markets in which we participate, or if customers choose to go to our competition, we may attract fewer buyers and our revenue could decrease.\nJewelry and watch retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for jewelry sales primarily against specialty jewelers such as Zales, Jared, and Kay\u2019s, and other retailers that sell jewelry and watches including department stores, discount stores, apparel outlets, and internet retailers. The jewelry and watch category competes for a share of our customers\u2019 disposable income with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, and travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving, and somewhat to bridal jewelry (e.g. engagement, wedding, and anniversary). Bullion\nConsumers are increasingly shopping or starting their jewelry-buying experience online, which makes it easier for them to compare prices with other jewelry retailers. If DGSE\u2019s brands do not offer the same or similar items at the lowest prices, consumers may purchase their jewelry from competitors, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations.\nOur DGSE wholesale and jewelry business is seasonal, with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons, so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operational results.\nOur DGSE wholesale and jewelry sales are seasonal by nature. Our sales are traditionally greater during significant holidays that occur in late fall, winter or early spring. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during these seasons depends upon the general level of retail sales at such times, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. Given the timing of our annual seasonality, inclement weather can at times pose a substantial barrier to consumer retail activity and have a material negative impact on our store traffic. If events or circumstances were to occur that negatively impact consumer spending during such holiday seasons, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and operating results.\nIf we misjudge the demand for our products, high inventory levels could adversely affect future operating results and profitability.\nConsumer demand for our products can affect inventory levels. If consumer demand is lower than expected, inventory levels can rise, causing a strain on operating cash flow. If the inventory cannot be sold through our wholesale or retail outlets, additional write-downs or write-offs to future earnings could be necessary. Conversely, if consumer demand is higher than expected, insufficient inventory levels could result in unfulfilled customer orders, loss of revenue and an unfavorable impact on customer relationships. In particular, volatility and uncertainty related to macro-economic factors make it more difficult for us to forecast customer demand in our various markets. Failure to properly judge consumer demand and properly manage inventory could have a material adverse effect on profitability and liquidity.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements and our ability to secure financing and credit could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe require continued access to capital, and a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Similarly, if actual costs to build new stores significantly exceed planned costs, our ability to build new stores or to operate new stores profitably could be materially restricted. Credit and equity markets remain sensitive to world events and macro-economic developments. Therefore, our cost of borrowing may increase, and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or to refinance long-term obligations as they become payable. Additionally, our borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies\u2019 short- and long-term debt ratings which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our borrowing cost and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A significant increase in our costs to finance operations may have a material adverse impact on our business results and financial condition.\nPART I\nItem 1A\nInterest-rate fluctuations could increase our interest expense.\nInterest rates could rise, which would increase our borrowing cost, or could make it difficult or impossible to secure financing.\nA failure in our information systems could prevent us from effectively managing and controlling our business or serving our customers.\nWe rely on our information systems to manage and operate our stores and business. These include our telephone phone system, website, point-of-sale application, accounting package and other systems. Each store is part of an information network that permits us to maintain adequate cash inventory, daily reconcile cash balances, and timely report revenues and expenses. Any disruption in the availability of our information systems could adversely affect our operation, the ability to serve our customers and our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified directors, management and other skilled employees.\nOur future success and growth depend on the continued services of our directors, key management and employees. Losing services of any of these individuals or any other key employee or contractor could materially affect our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industries is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining them. There are a limited number of people with knowledge of, and experience in, our industries. We do not have employment agreements with many of our key employees. We do not maintain life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of key personnel, especially without advance notice, or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on sales and operations. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to retain our key management and skilled personnel, or that we will be able to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.\nWe have not paid dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid Common Stock dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current business plan provides for reinvesting earnings in an effort to complete development of our technologies, inventories and expansion, with the goal of increasing sales and long-term profitability and value.\nWe are subject to new and existing corporate-governance and internal-control reporting requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the Corporate Governance Reforms, we face corporate-governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the\u201dDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Exchange. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. We cannot ensure that we will be able to comply fully with these laws, rules and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting and similar matters. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could subject us to investigation and enforcement actions, and could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and the value and liquidity of our securities.\nPART I\nItem 1A\nOur websites may be vulnerable to security breaches and similar threats, which could result in our liability for damages and harm to our reputation.\nDespite the implementation of network security measures, our websites are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by internet users. These occurrences could result in our liability for damages, and our reputation could suffer. Circumvention of our security measures may result in the misappropriation of customer or other confidential information. Any such security breach could lead to interruptions, delays and cessation of service to our customers and could result in a decline in revenue and income.\nFluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities, particularly gold, which accounts for the majority of our merchandise costs, could adversely impact our earnings and cash availability.\nWhile jewelry manufacturing is a major driver of demand for gold, management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly driven by investment transactions which have resulted in significant changes in its cost over the past decade. Our cost of merchandise and potentially our earnings may be adversely impacted by investment-market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly increase or decrease.\nAn inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability. Historically, jewelry retailers have been able, over time, to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs. However, in general, particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices. There is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable, so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur. Moreover, any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory, or changes in the merchandise available to customers.\nA significant portion of our profit is generated from buying and selling pre-owned jewelry or other precious-metal-based products. Significant price fluctuations in precious metals, especially downward, can have a severe impact on this part of our business, as people are less likely to sell these products to us if they believe their merchandise is being undervalued, or if they believe the value is uncertain.\nThe conflict-mineral diligence process, the results from that process and the related reporting obligations could increase costs, adversely affect our reputation and adversely affect our ability to obtain merchandise.\nIn August 2012, the SEC, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals, including gold, from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The gold-supply chain is complex, and while our management believes that the rules only cover less than 1% of annual worldwide gold production (based upon current estimates), the final rules require certain jewelry retailers and manufacturers that file with the SEC to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin of the statutorily designated minerals that are used in products we sell. Jewelry retailers or manufacturers who meet certain criteria were required to file certain reports with the SEC beginning in May 2014, disclosing their due-diligence measures related to country of origin, the results of those activities, and related determinations. In conjunction with legal counsel, we have determined that we do not have sufficient control over manufacturing of any of our products to be included in the group of companies required to provide conflict-minerals disclosure and reporting.\nIf our sourcing processes should change, or if there is a determination that our current practices should be covered by the conflict-minerals reporting and disclosure guidelines, we would need to implement significant additional measures to comply with these rules. We cannot be certain of the costs that might be associated with such regulatory compliance. The final rules also cover tungsten, which is contained in a small portion of items that we sell. Other minerals, such as diamonds, could be added to those currently covered by these rules. We may incur reputational risks with customers and other stakeholders if, due to the complexity of the global supply chain, we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the relevant metals. Also, if the responses of parts of our supply chain to verification requests were adverse, it could harm our ability to obtain merchandise and add to compliance costs\nPART I\nItem 1A\nOur customer concentration in one significant customer and vendor could have an adverse impact on our business.\nA significant amount of DGSE\u2019s revenue is sourced from sales to and purchases from one customer, which was a related party through May 20, 2019. This related party accounted for 4% of our sales and 6% of our purchases in Fiscal 2019 prior to May 20, 2019, and for 11% of our sales and 2% of our purchases in Fiscal 2018. No other retail or wholesale customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenues as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During Fiscal 2017, we decided start doing business with two separate parties who buy and sell our excess bullion. This reduced our dependency on the related party and lowered our transactional risk. On May 20, 2019, the related party became a regular customer and vendor due to the series of transactions described in Relationships paragraph on page 4.\nA significant amount of the Echo Entities\u2019 refining revenue comes from one customer, Hanwa. Hanwa\u2019s refining facility is based in Japan and any adverse break in the relationship could reduce the flow of refining materials and revenue. While it remains a developing situation, the coronavirus pandemic and any continuing quarantines, interruptions in travel and business disruptions with respect to us or Hanwa could cause such an adverse break in the relationship and reduce refining revenue to us, possibly to a significant degree. Although we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. The duration of any such impact cannot be predicted.\nPART I\nItem 1B, 2, 3, 4", "PERMNO": 10028, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "ELA"}
