{"cik": "1031029", "company": "Startek, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMarket and Client Related Risks\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated by a limited number of clients. The loss or reduction in business from any of these clients would adversely affect our business and the results of operations.\nOur five largest clients together accounted for 40% of our revenue; our top client accounted for 18% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Any loss of business from any major client could reduce our revenue and significantly harm our business.\nWe may not be able to retain our principal clients. If we were to lose any of our principal clients, we may not be able to replace the revenue on a timely basis. Several factors other than our performance could cause the loss of a client or reduction of business from a client. In certain cases, our business may be impacted when a large client changes its outsourcing strategy by moving more work in-house. Reduced outsourcing spending in response to a challenging economic or competitive environment may also result in our loss of a client.\nThe future revenue we generate from our principal clients may decline or grow at a slower rate than expected or than it has in the past. In the event we lose any of our principal clients or do not receive call volumes anticipated from these clients, we may suffer from the costs of underutilized capacity because of our inability to eliminate all the costs associated with conducting business with that client. This could exacerbate the effect that the loss of a principal client would have on our operating results and financial condition. Additional, productivity gains could be necessary to offset the negative impact that lower per-minute revenue at higher volume levels would have on our margins in future periods.\nWe depend on several large clients concentrated in a few industries, as well as clients located in a few geographies. Economic slowdown or factors that affect these industries could reduce our revenues and harm our business.\nA substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in the telecommunication industry. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived 32% of our total revenues from the telecommunication industry. We expect to continue to experience volatility with regard to call volumes with our telecoms clients in 2022. The shift in client demand from customer voice experience solutions toward digital CX solutions may increase as digital solutions become more effective at resolving customers\u2019 needs. This may lower the demand for our services or impact the prices that we can obtain for our services and consequently, adversely affect our revenues and profitability. A reduction in the amount of business we receive from our clients could also result in stranded capacity and costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nEconomic slowdowns in some markets, particularly the U.S., Saudi Arabia, India, Australia, South Africa, Malaysia, and Argentina may cause reductions in spending by our clients. This may impede our ability to maintain existing business, or develop new business, and adversely impact the results of our operations and our financial condition. Three factors could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and adversely affect our results of operations. They are a downturn in any of our targeted industries, particularly telecoms, banking and financial services, travel and leisure industries, a slowdown or reversal of the trend to offshore business process outsourcing in any of these industries, or the introduction of regulation that restricts or discourages companies from outsourcing.\nClient consolidation could result in a loss of business that would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe telecommunications industry has had a significant level of consolidation. We cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired themselves. Such consolidations may decrease our business volume and revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements and can generally be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty.\nWe enter into written agreements with each client for our services and seek to sign multi-year contracts. However, these contracts generally permit termination upon 30 to 90 days' notice by our clients; they do not designate us as our clients' exclusive outsourced services provider, do not penalize our clients for early termination, hold us responsible for work performed that does not meet predefined specifications, and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments. Accordingly, we face the risk that our clients may cancel or renegotiate contracts we have with them, which may adversely affect our results. If a principal client canceled or did not renew their contract with us, our results would suffer. In addition, because the amount of revenue generated from any client is generally dependent on the volume and activity of our clients' customers, as described above, our business depends in part on the success of our client's products. The number of customers who are attracted to the products of our clients may not be sufficient or our clients may not continue to develop new products that will require our services, in which case it may be more likely for our clients to terminate their contracts with us. Clients can generally reduce the volume of services they outsource to us without any penalties, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and overall financial condition.\nOur strategy depends on companies continuing to outsource non-core services.\nSome of our clients have been decreasing the number of firms they rely on to provide outsourced services. Due to financial uncertainties and the potential reduction in demand for our client's products and services, our clients and prospective clients may decide to further consolidate the number of firms on which they rely for outsourced services. Under these circumstances, our clients may cancel current contracts with us, or we may fail to attract new clients, which will adversely affect our financial condition.\nIntense competition in the market for outsourcing services could affect our win rates and pricing, which could reduce our share of business from clients and decrease our revenues and/or our profits.\nOur revenues and profits depend, in part, upon the continued demand for our services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a competitive and cost-effective manner. The outsourcing services market is highly competitive. Our competitors include large global outsourcing and technology firms, regional outsourcing services firms, software and solution providers, niche service providers, and in-house customer support services departments of large corporations.\nThe outsourcing services industry is experiencing rapid changes that are affecting the competitive landscape, including recent divestitures and acquisitions that have resulted in consolidation within the industry. These changes may result in larger competitors with significant resources or competitors with more competitive service offerings in emerging areas of demand, such as digital solutions, cloud-based solutions, and AI-based solutions. In addition, some of our competitors have added offshore capabilities to their service offerings. These competitors may be able to offer their services using offshore and onsite models more efficiently. In addition, many of these competitors are substantially larger than us and have more diversified infrastructure and contact center locations than Startek. We may face competition in countries where we currently operate, as well as in countries in which we expect to expand our operations. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, generate greater revenues, have more extensive existing client relationships and technology partnerships, and have greater brand recognition than Startek. We may be unable to compete successfully against these competitors or may lose clients to these competitors.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete effectively also depends in part on factors outside our control, such as the price at which our competitors offer comparable services, and the extent of our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to their clients\u2019 needs. Moreover, our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients often expect that as we do more business with them, they will receive volume discounts or lower rates. In addition, existing and new customers are also increasingly using third-party consultants with broad market knowledge to assist them in negotiating contractual terms. Any inability to maintain or increase the pricing on account of this practice may also adversely impact our revenues, gross profits, operating margins, and results of operations.\nRisks Arising From the Investments We Make in Anticipation of and To Maintain Our Growth\nOur business relies heavily on technology and computer systems, which subjects us to various uncertainties, damage, or disruptions within or beyond our control\nWe have invested in sophisticated and specialized telecoms and computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to meet our clients' needs. We anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis to maintain our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that any of our information systems will be adequate to meet our future needs or that we will be able to incorporate new technology to enhance and develop our existing services. There can be no assurance that any technology or computer system will not encounter outages or disruptions. Any significant failure, damage, or destruction of our equipment or systems or any major disruptions to basic infrastructures, such as power and telecoms systems in the locations in which we operate, could impede our ability to provide services to our clients and thus adversely affect their businesses, have a negative impact on our reputation and may cause us to incur substantial additional expenses to repair or replace damaged equipment or facilities. Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to anticipate and develop information technology solutions, controls, and processes that keep pace with evolving industry standards, changing client demands, and increasing risks.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we fail to enhance existing services or anticipate and develop new services and effectively manage the rapid changes in the use of technology.\nThe outsourcing and technology services market is characterized by rapid technological change leading to automation of services, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, and new product and service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate these advances and develop new service offerings to meet client needs. We may fail to anticipate or respond to these advances on a timely basis, or, if we do respond, the services or technologies that we develop may not be successful in the marketplace and may need significant investments. We are working to develop several new solutions involving AI-based automation, robotic process automation, social media, analytics and other technologies both in-house and in partnership with smaller companies that have developed niche expertise in these technologies. The complexity of these solutions, our inexperience in developing or implementing them, and significant competition in the markets for these solutions may affect our ability to market these solutions successfully. In addition, the development of some services and technologies may involve significant upfront investments and the failure of these services and technologies may result in our inability to recoup some or all these investments. Further, better or more competitively priced products, services, or technologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services non-competitive or obsolete.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.\nOur profitability is influenced by our facility capacity utilization. The majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our client's customers. As a result, our capacity utilization varies, and demands on our capacity are, to some degree, beyond our control. We continuously anticipate and forecast business growth and infrastructure requirements and may invest in new facilities with or without contracted business for such facilities. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, periods of idle capacity following the opening of new facilities where forecasted volume levels do not materialize. In addition, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, idle peak period capacity when we open a new facility or terminate or complete a large client program. These periods of idle capacity may be exacerbated if we expand our facilities or open new facilities in anticipation of new client business because we generally cannot to require a client to enter a long-term contract or to require clients to reimburse us for capacity expansion costs if they terminate their relationship with us or do not provide us with anticipated service volumes.\nWe assess the expected long-term capacity utilization of our facilities and may consolidate or close underperforming facilities to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins. We may incur impairment losses and restructuring charges in future years as a result of closing facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal facility capacity utilization.\nIf client demand declines due to economic conditions or otherwise, we may not be able to leverage our fixed costs as effectively, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse changes to our relationships with the companies with whom we have an alliance or joint venture or in the business of the companies with whom we have an alliance or joint venture could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have a joint venture with a large telecom operator in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The priorities and objectives of the joint venture partner may differ from ours. In addition, the joint venture partner is the largest client of the joint venture entity. An adverse economic environment leading to adverse conditions at the joint venture partner\u2019s business could lead to lower volumes for us and may adversely affect our results of operations. Any renegotiation in the terms of the joint venture agreement that is detrimental to us relative to the current shareholder agreement between the joint venture parties could also have an adverse impact on our financials. Termination of the contract with the joint venture partner entity could significantly hamper our operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and would have a significant adverse impact on the consolidated results of our operations.\nGoodwill that we carry on our balance sheet could be subjected to significant impairment charges in the future.\nAs a result of two significant business combinations, we carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. Goodwill is subject to impairment review at least annually. Impairment testing under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may lead to impairment charges in the future. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment, we concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill.\nWe have and may incur material restructuring charges in the future.\nWe continually evaluate ways to reduce our operating expenses and adapt to changing industry and market conditions through new restructuring opportunities, including more effective utilization of our assets, workforce, and operating facilities. We have recorded restructuring charges in the past related to involuntary employee terminations, facility closures, and other restructuring activities. We may incur material restructuring charges in the future. The risk that we incur material restructuring charges may be heightened during economic downturns, if clients\u2019 demand, preferences, or expectations change rapidly or with expanded global operations.\nOperations Related Risks\nFailure to attract and retain key management personnel may adversely impact our strategy execution and financial results.\nOur ability to attract, successfully integrate, and retain key management personnel could have a significant impact on our ability to compete or to execute our business strategy. Changes in key management personnel may temporarily disrupt our operations as the new management becomes familiar with our business. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, motivate, train, and retain key management personnel.\nIf we are not able to hire and retain qualified employees, our ability to service our existing customers and retain new customers will be adversely affected.\nOur success is largely dependent on our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified employees. Our business is people-intensive and, as is typical for our industry, continues to experience high employee turnover. Our operations, especially our technical support and customer care services, generally require specially trained employees, which, in turn, requires significant recruiting and training costs. Such turnover adversely affects our operating efficiency, productivity, and ability to fully respond to client demand, adversely impacting our operating results. Some of this turnover can be attributed to the fact that we compete for labor not only with other call centers but also with other similar-paying jobs, including retail, services industries, food service, etc. As such, improvements in the local economies in which we operate can adversely affect our ability to recruit agents in those locations. Further increases in employee turnover or failure to effectively manage these high attrition rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe addition of new clients or implementation of new projects for existing clients may require us to recruit, hire, and train personnel at accelerated rates. We may not be able to successfully recruit, hire, train, and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff for an existing business or future growth, particularly if we undertake new client relationships in industries in which we have not previously provided services. Because a substantial portion of our operating expenses consists of labor-related costs, labor shortages or increases in wages (including minimum wages as mandated by the federal governments, employee benefit costs, employment tax rates, and other labor-related expenses) could cause our business, operating profits, and financial condition to suffer. Economic and legislative changes in the U.S. may encourage organizing efforts in the future which, if successful, could further increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity.\nOur operating costs may increase as a result of higher employee costs or an increase in minimum wages.\nWe have sought to contain our employee costs by limiting salary increases and payment of cash bonuses to our employees. The local economies in some of the locations in which we operate may experience growth, which causes pressure on employee rates to remain competitive within the local economies. If these growth trends continue, we may need to further increase salaries or otherwise compensate our employees at higher levels to remain competitive. Higher salaries or other forms of compensation are likely to increase our cost of operations. If such increases are not offset by increased revenue, they will negatively impact our financial results.\nWage costs in offshore delivery locations such as India and the Philippines have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the U.S. for comparably skilled professionals, which has been one of our competitive strengths. Offshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the U.S. and elsewhere. There has been increased expression of concern by many organizations and public figures about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries. Recently there has been an indication that immigration regulations in the U.S. could undergo significant changes that may require us to substitute offshoring with local hires in the U.S. Such hiring could result in overall increased wage costs thereby impacting profitability.\nAdditionally, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect our profit margins. We have historically experienced significant competition for employees from large multinational companies that have established and continue to establish offshore operations in India, as well as from companies within India. This competition has led to wage pressures in attracting and retaining employees, and these wage pressures have led to a situation where wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the U.S.\nEmployee strikes, collective bargaining agreements, and other employee-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.\nIn certain geographies, like Argentina, our workforce is part of collective bargaining agreements that require us to negotiate wage hikes with labor unions. Our inability to negotiate wage hikes favorable for Startek or our inability to pass 100 percent of these wage hikes completely to our customers in the form of increased pricing will adversely impact our profitability and operating margins. In the past, some of our employees in other geographies have attempted to organize a labor union, and economic and legislative changes may encourage organizing efforts in the future, which, if successful, could further increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. We cannot assure that there will not be any strike, lockout or material labor dispute in the future. Work interruptions or stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe are also a party to various labor disputes and potential disputes. If our provisions for any of our labor claims are insufficient or the claims against us rise significantly in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for 2022 could get adversely affected by health pandemics such as the recent Coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by health pandemics, including, but not limited to, outbreaks of the coronavirus or COVID-19. Outbreaks of COVID-19 have alarmed people around the world, affecting economic activity globally. More recently, cases of the COVID-19 virus have been identified internationally, including confirmed human outbreaks and deaths. Any prolonged pandemic such as COVID-19, or other contagious infection in the countries in which we do business may result in employee absences, lower asset utilization rates, voluntary closure of our offices and delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business. Moreover, health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the closure of our offices and delivery centers. Any prolonged or widespread health pandemic could severely disrupt our business operations, resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on telephone and data services provided by various local and long-distance telephone companies. Because of this dependence, any change to the telecoms market that would disrupt these services or limit our ability to obtain services at favorable rates could affect our business. For example, the concentration and bargaining power of technology and telecoms suppliers, most of which are beyond our control or which we cannot predict, could increase the cost of telecommunication services. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering long-term contracts with various providers for telephone and data services and by investing in redundant circuits. There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us or to offer the same or lower rates in the future and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that a redundant circuit would not also be disrupted. A significant increase in the cost of telephone services that are not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services or any significant interruption in telephone services could adversely affect our business.\nOur foreign operations subject us to the risk of currency exchange fluctuations.\nAlthough most of our revenue and costs are in the local currency of the geography we operate in, we do run a currency risk because we deliver a portion of our business in an offshore location relative to the location of our clients. In such offshore deals, in certain geographies revenue is generated in U.S. dollars but operating costs are paid in local currencies. Thus, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of these currencies to the U.S. dollar. We engage in hedging activities relating to our exposure to such fluctuations. Our hedging strategy, including our ability to acquire the desired amount of hedge contracts, may not sufficiently protect us from strengthening or weakening these currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nSome of the countries we have a presence in have experienced inflation and volatility in the past and some Latin American countries, such as Argentina, have recently been classified as hyperinflationary economies. While inflation may not have a significant effect on the profit and loss of a local subsidiary itself, depreciation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar would reduce the value of the dividends payable to us from our operating companies. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars and our results of operations would be adversely affected if these local currencies depreciate significantly against the U.S. dollar, which may also affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period, as we convert our subsidiaries\u2019 statements of financial position into U.S. dollars from local currencies at the period end exchange rate and income and cash flow statements at average exchange rates for the year.\nWe may incur losses due to unanticipated or significant intra-quarter movements in currency markets which could have an adverse impact on our profit margin and results of operations. Also, the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively.\nChanges in tax laws in the geographies we operate in could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to tax audits, including with respect to transfer pricing, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We continuously review the potential impacts of the recent changes; however, we cannot predict any future tax law changes which could have an impact on our future tax liabilities.\nThe governments of jurisdictions where we have a presence could enact new tax legislation which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our delivery centers in a tax-efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws, possible changes in such laws, and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties. Changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate, or the cost of our services to our clients, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to transfer pricing and other tax-related regulations and any determination that we have failed to comply with them could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nTransfer pricing regulations to which we are subject require that any international transaction among our company and its subsidiaries be on arm\u2019s length terms. We believe that the international transactions among the Startek group companies are on arm\u2019s length terms. If, however, the applicable tax authorities determine that the transactions among the Startek group companies do not meet arm\u2019s length criteria, we may incur an increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties. This would cause our tax expense to increase, possibly materially, thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows.\nOur existing debt may affect our flexibility in operating and developing our business and our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $170 million. Our level of indebtedness may have significant negative effects on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nImpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future (or to obtain such financing on acceptable terms) for working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, or other important needs\n\u2022\nRequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, could impair our liquidity and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, and other important needs\n\u2022\nIncreasing the possibility of an event of default under the financial and operating covenants contained in our debt instruments\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to adjust to rapidly changing conditions in the industry, reducing our ability to withstand competitive pressures, and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or business than our competitors with less debt\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We can provide no assurance that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained. Our inability to obtain such refinancing or financing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur financing agreements impose debt covenants which are to be fulfilled by the Company and/or its subsidiaries failing which may have detrimental impact on the potential growth and results of operations.\nOur secured revolving credit facility and the senior term loan facility agreement entered by our subsidiaries contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that may limit or restrict our ability to engage in certain activities, including but not limited to, making certain investments, limiting capital expenditures, incurring additional indebtedness, and engaging in mergers and acquisitions. If we are not able to meet these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in the business or economic conditions may be limited, and we may be unable to engage in certain activities that otherwise may be beneficial to our business. We cannot assure that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our credit facility, or that in the event of noncompliance, we will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from our lenders. If we fail to comply with the terms of the agreement, our lender could decide to call any amounts outstanding immediately, and there can be no assurance that we would have adequate resources or collateral to satisfy the demand. Any such scenario would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to fund our working capital requirements and new investments, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe outsourcing industry is characterized by high working capital requirements and the need to make new investments in operating sites and employee resources to meet the requirements of our clients. We incur significant startup costs related to investments in infrastructure to provide our services and the hiring and training of employees, such expenses being historically incurred before revenue is generated.\nIn addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in our key clients\u2019 payment policies, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund our working capital needs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our average days' sales outstanding (DSO) was approximately 55 days. If our key clients implement policies that extend the payment terms of our invoices, our working capital levels could be adversely affected and our finance costs may increase. If we are unable to fund our working capital requirements, access financing at competitive prices, or make investments to meet the expanding business of our existing and potential new clients, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory and Related Risks\nCyberattacks or the improper disclosure or control of personal information could result in liability and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients and we may be required to store sensitive or confidential client data in connection with the services we provide. As a result, we are subject to contractual terms and numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect this information. Furthermore, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Although we have implemented appropriate policies and procedures to reduce the possibility of physical, logical, and personnel security breaches, along with appropriate audit oversight for verifying continued operating effectiveness of the same through internal audits and external SSAE16, HIPAA, GDPR, ISAE 3402, ISO27K1, ISO 14K1, and PCI-DSS reviews, no such measures can completely eliminate the risk of cybersecurity attacks, especially in light of advances in criminal capabilities (including cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses and the like), the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities or attempts to exploit existing vulnerabilities in interconnected third party systems that are beyond our control systems.\nUnauthorized disclosure, either actual or perceived, of a sensitive or confidential client or customer data, whether through systems failure, system intrusion, employee negligence, fraud, or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability, and damage to our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company experienced a cyberattack by a threat actor in 2021. We were able to thwart the attack with minimal damage to us both operationally and financially and were able to realize a substantial part of the liability from our insurance cover. However, there is no assurance that there may not be a material adverse effect in the future. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not adequately or timely compensate us for all losses we may incur as any of our client contracts do not contain limitations of liability for such losses.\nOur foreign operations are subject to social, political, and economic risks that differ from those in the U.S.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated approximately 81% or $569 million of our revenue from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to foreign operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n\u2022\nDifficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain regions\n\u2022\nDiffering employment practices and labor issues\n\u2022\nLocal business and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices\n\u2022\nVolatility in currencies\n\u2022\nCurrency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the U.S.\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences\n\u2022\nThe responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, for example with respect to corrupt practices, employment, and licensing\n\u2022\nThe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist activities\n\u2022\nAccess to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations\nOur global growth (including growth in new regions in the U.S.) also subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws.\nAlthough we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform, if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe process, transmit and store personally identifiable information and unauthorized access to or the unintended release of this information could result in a claim for damage or loss of business and create unfavorable publicity.\nWe process, transmit and store personally identifiable information, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. This information may include social security numbers, financial and health information, as well as other personal information. As a result, we are subject to certain contractual terms as well as federal, state and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personally identifiable information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized access and to comply with these laws and regulations. We use the internet as a mechanism for delivering our services to clients, which may expose us to potential disruptive intrusions. Unauthorized access, system denials of service, or failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages, loss of business, damages from individual claimants, fines, penalties, criminal prosecution, and unfavorable publicity, any of which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, third party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may have an unintended release of personally identifiable information.\nWe are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security, and privacy of protected health information.\nWe are required to comply with applicable laws governing the transmission, security, and privacy of health information, including, among others, the standards of The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Failure to comply with any of these laws could make it difficult to expand our healthcare business process outsourcing business and/or cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe failure to comply with debt collection and consumer credit reporting regulations could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business, and could make it more difficult for us to retain existing customers or attract new customers.\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person, which includes our debt collection business. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection communications and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. In addition, many U.S. states require a debt collector to apply for, be granted, and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities in a state. We are currently licensed (or exempt from licensing requirements) to provide debt collection services in most U.S. states. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are determined to have violated the FDCPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or analogous state laws, which could make it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers and could otherwise harm our business.\nArgentina has undergone significant political, social, and economic instability in the past several years. If such instability continues or worsens, our Argentine operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, our Argentina operations accounted for 4.6% of our total revenue. Argentina has been facing economic difficulty for the past several years. Since 2015, the Argentine economy has experienced a recession, as well as a political and social crisis, and the significant depreciation of the Argentine peso against major international currencies. Depending on the relative impact of other variables affecting our operations, including technological changes, inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and regulatory changes, the continued depreciation of the Argentine peso may have a negative impact on our business in Argentina.\nThe country has been experiencing high inflation in recent years and there can be no assurance that Argentina will not experience another recession, higher inflation, devaluation, unemployment, and social unrest in the future.\nIn the past, Argentina has been under a severe exchange control system that required government approval for any transfer of funds. Although administrations have taken measures to lift foreign exchange controls there can be no assurance that the Argentine government will not impose new restrictions on the transfer of funds from Argentina to preserve and protect foreign exchange reserves. If we are unable to repatriate funds from Argentina for whatever reason, we will not be able to use the cash flow from our Argentine operations to finance our operating requirements elsewhere or to satisfy our debt obligations.\nMarket Related Risks\nOur largest stockholder can significantly influence corporate actions.\nCapital Square Partners (CSP), a Singapore-based private equity fund, is our principal shareholder following the combination of Aegis and the Company. CSP owns approximately 56% of our outstanding stock. The Stockholders Agreement dated July 20, 2018, gives CSP the right to appoint majority directors on our Board of Directors including the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Currently, there are four Directors appointed by CSP, including the Executive Chairman and CEO.\nCSP has a continuing ability to exercise significant influence over our affairs for the foreseeable future, including controlling the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or our assets. This concentrated control by CSP limits the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our other shareholders do not view as beneficial.\nFuture equity issuances may dilute the holdings of ordinary shareholders and could materially affect the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe may in the future decide to offer additional equity to raise capital or for other purposes. Any such additional offering could reduce the proportionate ownership and voting interests of holders of our ordinary shares, as well as our earnings per ordinary share and net asset value per ordinary share. Future sales of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, whether by us or by our existing shareholders, or the perception that sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our shares, which could decline significantly.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may decline significantly and unexpectedly.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, changes in management, the degree of success in implementing our business and growth strategies, announcements of new contracts or contract cancellations, announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, the perception that significant stockholders may sell or intend to sell their shares or other events or factors we cannot currently foresee. We are also subject to broad market fluctuations, given the overall volatility of the current U.S. and global economies, where the market prices of equity securities of many companies experience substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, because our common stock trades at relatively low volume levels, any change in demand for our stock can be expected to substantially influence market prices thereof.\nIf Amazon exercises its right to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to the Warrant, it will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOn January 23, 2018, we entered into a Transaction Agreement (the Amazon Transaction Agreement) with Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon). Pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon, a warrant (the Warrant) to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain vesting events. If Amazon exercises its right to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to the Warrant, it will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and reduce our earnings per share. In addition, any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant by Amazon could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85077, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SRT"}
