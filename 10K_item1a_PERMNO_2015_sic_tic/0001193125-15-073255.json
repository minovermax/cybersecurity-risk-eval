RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific risk factors described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and a loss of all or part of your investment. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nRecent historical growth may not provide an accurate representation of the growth we may experience in the future, which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\nWe launched our first 20 ETFs in June 2006. We incurred significant losses following the launch of our first ETFs. We first reported net income in the first quarter of 2011 and we only began to generate positive cash flow on a full quarterly basis in the second fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2010 and, as a result, recent historical growth may not provide an accurate representation of the growth we may experience in the future, which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Although we have reported net income for the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 fiscal years, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. Prior to generating net income for 2011, we incurred net losses of $27.0 million, $21.2 million and $7.5 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Even though we have achieved profitability, because of the various risks outlined in this Report, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable.\nThe significant growth we have experienced over the past three years may be difficult to sustain.\nOur U.S. listed AUM, which makes up the vast majority of our global AUM, has increased significantly over the last three years, from $18.3 billion at the end of 2012 to $34.9 billion at the end of 2013 to $39.3 billion at the end of 2014. The absolute measure of our AUM represents a significant rate of growth that has been and may continue to be difficult to sustain. Furthermore, as we grow larger and increase our AUM, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain our current rate of growth. In addition, as compared to 17 other traditional publicly traded asset managers, we were ranked number one for our rate of organic growth of 14.5% in 2014. The continued growth of our business will depend on, among other things, our ability to retain and recruit key investment professionals, to devote sufficient resources to maintaining existing investment strategies and to selectively develop new, value-added investment strategies. Our business growth will also depend on our success in achieving superior investment performance from our investment strategies, as well as our ability to maintain and extend our distribution capabilities, to deal with changing market conditions, to maintain adequate financial and business controls and to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements arising in response to both the increased sophistication of the investment management industry and the significant market and economic events of the last few years.\nChallenging global market conditions associated with declining prices of securities can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETF shareholders to sell their fund shares and trigger redemptions.\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global market conditions and the declining prices of securities, which may result in a decrease in demand for investment products, a higher redemption rate and/or a decline in AUM. The securities markets are highly volatile and securities prices may increase or decrease for many reasons, including general economic conditions, political events, acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control. Substantially all of our revenue is determined by the amount of our U.S. listed AUM and substantially all (95%) of our U.S. listed AUM at December 31, 2014 was represented by equity securities, in both the international and U.S. markets. As a result, our business can be expected to generate lower revenue in declining equity market environments or general economic downturns. A decline in the prices of securities held by the WisdomTree ETFs may cause our revenue to decline by either causing the value of our U.S. listed AUM to decrease, which would result in lower advisory fees, or causing investors in the WisdomTree ETFs to sell their shares in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk, thus triggering redemptions that would also result in decreased AUM and lower fees.\nFluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM may negatively impact revenue and operating margin.\nThe level of our revenue depends on the level and mix of our AUM. Our revenue is derived primarily from advisory fees based on a percentage of the value of our AUM and varies with the nature of the ETFs, which have different fee levels. Fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM may be attributable in part to market conditions outside of our control that have had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our revenue and operating margin.\nWe are subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the foreign markets as discussed below. Individual markets may be adversely affected by economic, political, financial, or other instabilities that are particular to the country or regions in which a market is located, including without limitation local acts of terrorism, economic crises or other business, social or political crises. Declines in these markets and currency fluctuations have caused in the past, and may cause in the future, a decline in our revenue. Changing market conditions and currency fluctuations may cause a shift in our asset mix between foreign and U.S. assets, potentially resulting in a decline in our revenue since we generally derive higher fee revenue from our ETFs investing in foreign markets, particularly in emerging markets.\nWe have had in the past, and in the future may have, investors who maintain significant positions in one or more of our ETFs. If such an investor were to broadly change or withdraw its investments in our ETFs because of a change to its investment strategy, market conditions or any other reason, it may significantly change the level and mix of our AUM, which may negatively affect our revenue and operating margin.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of products and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of those funds, investor sentiment toward the strategies pursued by those funds and our ability to maintain the AUM of those funds.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 78% of our U.S. listed ETF AUM was concentrated in ten of our WisdomTree ETFs (with 30% in WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) and 14% in WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)). Our AUM relating to these funds (and their percentage of our total AUM) has continued to increase during the first quarter of 2015, especially for the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund. As a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of those funds, investor sentiment toward investing in the strategies pursued by those funds and our ability to maintain the AUM of those funds.\nMost of our AUM is held in ETFs that invest in foreign securities and we therefore have substantial exposure to foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks.\nMany of our ETFs invest in securities of companies, governments and other organizations located outside the United States and at December 31, 2014, approximately 74% of our AUM was held by these ETFs. Therefore, the success of our business is closely tied to market conditions in foreign markets. Investments in non-U.S. issuers are affected by political, social and economic uncertainty effecting a country or region in which we are invested. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the revenue we earn from certain foreign invested ETFs. This occurs because an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies may result in a decrease in the dollar value of the AUM in these ETFs, which, in turn, would result in lower revenue. Furthermore, investors are likely to believe certain foreign invested ETFs, as well as certain of our currency and fixed income ETFs, are a less attractive investment opportunity when the value of the U.S. dollar rises relative to non-U.S. currencies, which could have the effect of reducing investments in these ETFs, thus reducing revenue.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from international hedged equity ETFs and are exposed to the market-specific political and economic risk, as well as general investor sentiment regarding monetary policy of these markets.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 45% of our ETF AUM was concentrated in our international hedged equity ETFs, which provide exposure to a specified international equity market while hedging the currency exposure of that market relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2014, approximately 37% of our revenue was derived from these ETFs. The significant inflows we experienced in 2013 were in our currency hedged Japanese equity ETF (DXJ), which was driven by political and economic policy changes in Japan, in particular the Japanese government\u2019s desire to implement policies which have decreased the value of the Yen. In 2014, our currency hedged European equity ETF (HEDJ) comprised the vast majority of our net inflows as the aggressive monetary policy of the European Central Bank weakened the Euro. The strengthening of the Yen or Euro against the U.S. dollar may have an adverse effect on our results. Our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of these funds, economic and market conditions in these markets, general investor sentiment regarding monetary policy of these markets and our ability to maintain the AUM of those funds. If the AUM in these funds were to decline, either because of declining market values or because of net outflows from these funds, our revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from products invested in securities of Japanese and European companies and are exposed to the market-specific political and economic risk, as well as general investor sentiment regarding future growth of these markets and currency fluctuations.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 31% of our U.S. listed ETF AUM was concentrated in our WisdomTree ETFs that primarily invest in equity securities issued by companies in Japan, including one fund, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund, that accounted for 30% of our ETF AUM.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 16% of our U.S. listed ETF AUM was concentrated in our WisdomTree ETFs that primarily invest in equity securities issued by companies in Europe, including one fund, WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund, that accounted for 14% of our ETF AUM.\nAs a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of those funds, economic and market conditions in either of these markets, general investor sentiment regarding future growth in these markets and currency fluctuations and our ability to maintain the AUM of those funds. If the AUM in the funds that are focused on either of these markets were to decline, either because of declining market values or because of net outflows from these funds, our revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from products invested in emerging markets and are exposed to the market-specific political and economic risks as well as general investor sentiment regarding future growth of those markets.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 18% of our ETF AUM was concentrated in our WisdomTree ETFs that primarily invest in equity or fixed income securities issued by companies or governments in emerging markets. In 2014, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from these ETFs. As a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to the performance of those funds, economic and market conditions in those emerging markets, general investor sentiment regarding future growth in those emerging markets and our ability to maintain the AUM of those funds. In addition, because these funds have a higher expense ratio than our other funds in general, they generate a disproportionate percentage of our total revenue. If the AUM in these funds were to decline, either because of declining market values or because of net outflows from these funds, our revenue would be adversely affected.\nMany of our WisdomTree ETFs have a limited track record and poor investment performance could cause our revenue to decline.\nMany of our ETFs have a limited track record upon which an evaluation of their investment performance can be made. At December 31, 2014, of our total 70 ETFs, 44 had a three year track record, 39 had a five year track record and none had a ten year track record. Furthermore, as part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our product offerings to ensure that all of our funds are useful, compelling and differentiated investment offerings, to more competitively align our overall product line in the current ETF landscape and to reallocate our attention and resources to areas of greater client interest. As a result, we may further adjust our product offering which may result in the closing of some of our ETFs, changing their investment objective or offering of new funds. The investment performance of our funds is important to our success. While strong investment performance could stimulate sales of our ETFs, poor investment performance, on an absolute basis or as compared to third party benchmarks or competitive products, could lead to a decrease in sales or stimulate redemptions, thereby lowering the AUM and reducing our revenue. Our fundamentally-weighted equity ETFs are designed to provide the potential for better risk-adjusted investment returns over full market cycles and are best suited for investors with a longer-term investment horizon. However, the investment approach of our equity ETFs may not perform well during certain shorter periods of time during different points in the economic cycle.\nWe currently depend on State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide us with critical administrative services to operate our business and the WisdomTree ETFs. The failure of State Street to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETF shareholders.\nWe currently depend upon State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street, to provide the WisdomTree Trust with custody services, fund accounting, administration, transfer agency and securities lending services. The failure of State Street to successfully provide us and the WisdomTree ETFs with these services could result in financial loss to us and WisdomTree ETF shareholders. In addition, because State Street provides a multitude of important services to us, changing this vendor relationship would be challenging. It might require us to devote a significant portion of management\u2019s time to negotiate a similar relationship with another vendor or have these services provided by multiple vendors, which would require us to coordinate the transfer of these functions to another vendor or vendors.\nWe depend on BNY Mellon and Western Asset Management to provide portfolio management services and other third parties to provide many critical services to operate our business and the WisdomTree ETFs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETF shareholders.\nWe depend on third party vendors to provide us with many services that are critical to operating our business, including BNY Mellon and Western Asset Management, as sub-advisers that provide us with portfolio management services, third party providers of index calculation services for our indexes, a distributor of the WisdomTree ETFs and a third party provider of indicative values of the portfolios of the WisdomTree ETFs. The failure of any of these key vendors to provide us and the WisdomTree ETFs with these services could lead to operational issues and result in financial loss to us and WisdomTree ETF shareholders.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have greater market share, offer a broader range of products and have greater financial resources than we do. As a result, we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share.\nOur business operates in intensely competitive industry segments. We compete directly with other ETF sponsors and mutual fund companies and indirectly against other investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives to those offered by us. We compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, investment performance, product features and breadth of product choices, and fees. Several ETF sponsors with whom we directly compete are seeking to obtain market share based on low fees. Many of our competitors have greater market share, offer a broader range of products and have greater financial resources than we do. Some financial institutions operate in a more favorable regulatory environment and/or have proprietary products and distribution channels which may provide certain competitive advantages to them and their investment products. Our competitors may also adopt products, services or strategies similar to ours, including the use of fundamentally-weighted indexes. In addition, over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of\nfinancial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This convergence could result in our competitors gaining greater resources and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. We believe that competition within the ETF industry will continue to increase as more traditional asset management companies become ETF sponsors.\nCompetitive pressures could reduce revenue and profit margins.\nThe ETF industry is becoming significantly more competitive as existing players broaden their suite of products to different strategies, in some cases, similar to ours. Although the ETF industry currently has a higher barrier to entry as a result of the need for ETF sponsors to obtain exemptive relief from the SEC in order to operate ETFs, traditional asset managers, many of whom are much larger than us, have started to enter the ETF space. For example, in August 2013, Charles Schwab & Co. launched six ETFs using the Russell fundamentally weighted indexes with fees generally equivalent with our comparable ETFs. Both Deutsche Bank and iShares have expanded their currency hedged equity product lines, at fees generally equivalent with our comparable ETFs. In February 2014, iShares launched a floating rate treasury ETF on the same day as we launched our similar ETF; however, iShares waived fees for one year while we did not. We expect that additional companies, both new and traditional asset managers, will continue to enter the ETF space.\nThere has also been increased price competition especially among commoditized product categories such as traditional, market capitalization weighted index exposures. Vanguard, Schwab, iShares and State Street primarily compete in this space and have offered low fee product for many years. However more recently, iShares and State Street have lowered prices across additional funds, or launched new funds at lower price points.\nIn addition, in 2008, the SEC proposed a rule that, if adopted, would eliminate the need to obtain exemptive relief, thereby lowering the barrier to entry. This proposed rule was never adopted and it is unclear whether a new rule could be proposed in 2015. In March 2010, the SEC announced it would defer approval of applications for exemptive relief for ETFs that make significant use of derivatives pending a review by the SEC of the use of derivatives by mutual funds, ETFs and other investment companies. This moratorium was lifted in December 2012 and may have served in the past to prevent potential competitors from directly competing with certain of our products. Now that the moratorium has been lifted, we may face increased competition and we may be forced to compete increasingly on the basis of price, and we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new products could cause our revenue and profit margins to decline.\nIn addition, in December 2014, the SEC granted Eaton Vance and related parties an exemption from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act to permit the offering of a form of non-transparent exchange traded managed funds. In addition, the SEC rejected proposals from Precidian and BlackRock to also offer a form of non-transparent exchange traded product. Subsequently, Precidian refiled its application with changes intended to address the SEC\u2019s concerns. Non-transparent exchange traded products may allow traditional actively managed mutual fund sponsors to compete more effectively against ETFs, which could reduce our revenue and profit margins.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected if the WisdomTree Trust determines that the advisory fees we receive from the WisdomTree ETFs should be reduced.\nOur advisory agreements with the WisdomTree Trust and the fees we collect from the WisdomTree ETFs are subject to review and approval by the Independent Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust. The advisory agreements are subject to initial review and approval. After the initial two-year term of the agreement for each ETF, the continuation of such agreement must be reviewed and approved at least annually by a majority of the Independent Trustees. In determining whether to approve the agreements, the Independent Trustees consider factors such as (i) the nature and quality of the services provided by us, (ii) the fees charged by us and the costs and profits realized by us in connection with such services, as well as any ancillary or \u201cfall-out\u201d benefits from such services, (iii) the extent to which economies of scale are shared with the WisdomTree ETFs, and (iv) the level of fees paid by other similar funds. If the Independent Trustees determine that the advisory fees we charge to any particular fund are too high, we will need to reduce our fees, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur risk management policies and procedures, and those of our third party vendors upon which we rely, may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure, including employee misconduct. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from exposure to these risks, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our financial condition, reputation and market share.\nWe have developed risk management policies and procedures and we continue to refine them as we conduct our business. Many of our procedures involve oversight of third party vendors that provide us with critical services such as portfolio management, custody and fund accounting and administration, and index calculation services. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure. Moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees, including fraud and non-compliance with policies. These risks are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we maintain insurance and use other traditional risk-shifting tools, such as third party indemnification, in order to manage certain exposures, they are subject to terms such as deductibles,\ncoinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from exposure and our exposure is not adequately covered by insurance or other risk-shifting tools, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our financial condition and could cause a reduction in our revenue as WisdomTree ETF shareholders shift their investments to the products of our competitors.\nCompliance with extensive, complex and changing regulation imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation of our business and operations. Our U.S. subsidiary, WisdomTree Asset Management, Inc., or WTAM, is a registered investment adviser and is subject to oversight by the SEC pursuant to its regulatory authority under the Investment Advisers Act. We also must comply with certain requirements under the Investment Company Act, with respect to the WisdomTree ETFs for which WTAM acts as investment adviser. WTAM is also a member of the National Futures Association, or NFA, and registered as a Commodity Pool Operator for certain of our ETFs. As a Commodity Pool Operator, we are subject to oversight by the NFA and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission pursuant to regulatory authority under the Commodities Exchange Act. In addition, the content and use of our marketing and sales materials and of our sales force is subject to the regulatory authority of FINRA. To a lesser extent, we are also subject to foreign laws and regulatory authorities with respect to operational aspects of our funds that invest in securities of issuers in foreign countries and in the sales of our funds in foreign jurisdictions. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of our business, including the authority to grant, and, in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular businesses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment adviser. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and thus result in redemptions from our ETFs and impede our ability to retain WisdomTree ETF shareholders and develop new WisdomTree ETF shareholders, all of which may reduce our revenue.\nWe face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extended investigation activity, adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties. Among other things, we could be fined or be prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities. The requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect WisdomTree ETF shareholders and our advisory clients, and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through WisdomTree ETF shareholder protection and market conduct requirements.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to modifications and further regulation. Recently, concerns have been raised about ETF\u2019s possible contribution to market volatility as well as the disclosure requirements applicable to certain types of more complex ETFs. New laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, applicable to us and our clients also may adversely affect our business, and our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to constantly monitor and react to these changes. Regulatory uncertainty continues to surround the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires federal agencies to implement numerous new rules, which, if adopted, may impose additional regulatory burdens and expenses on our business. Compliance with new laws and regulations may result in increased compliance costs and expenses.\nSpecific regulatory changes also may have a direct impact on our revenue. In addition to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines and sanctions, regulators continue to examine different aspects of the asset management industry. New regulation or judicial interpretations regarding the annual approval process for investment advisory agreements may result in the reduction of fees under these agreements, which would mean a reduction in our revenue.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As we continue to expand our international presence, a number of our subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems, in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. Regulators in these non-U.S. jurisdictions may have broad authority with respect to the regulation of financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe we have developed a strong brand and a reputation for innovative, thoughtful products, favorable long-term investment performance and excellent client services. The WisdomTree name and brand is a valuable asset and any damage to it could hamper our ability to maintain and grow our AUM and attract and retain employees, thereby having a material adverse effect on our revenue. Risks to our reputation may range from regulatory issues to unsubstantiated accusations. Managing such matters may be expensive, time-consuming and difficult.\nAbnormally wide bid/ask spreads and market disruptions that halt or disrupt trading or create extreme volatility could undermine investor confidence in the ETF investment structure and limit investor acceptance of ETFs.\nThe shares of the WisdomTree ETFs, like the shares of all ETFs, trade on exchanges in market transactions that generally approximate the value of the underlying portfolio of securities held by the particular ETF. Trading involves risks including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares, abnormally wide bid/ask spreads (the difference between the prices at which shares of an ETF can be bought and sold) that can exist for a variety of reasons and losses from trading. These risks can be exacerbated during periods when there is low demand for an ETF, when the markets in the underlying investments are closed, when markets conditions are extremely volatile or when trading is disrupted. This could result in limited growth or a reduction in the overall ETF market and result in our revenue not growing as rapidly as it has in the recent past or even in a reduction of revenue.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent years, and if we were unable to manage this growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent years, which has placed increased demands on our management and other resources and will continue to do so in the future. We may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate, manage our expanding operations effectively or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. Managing our growth effectively will involve, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to retain, motivate and manage our existing employees and attract and integrate new employees;\n\u2022\ndeveloping, implementing and improving our operational, financial, accounting, reporting and other internal systems and controls on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining and developing our various support functions including human resources, information technology, legal and corporate communications.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profitability.\nContinued growth will require continued investment in personnel, information technology infrastructure and marketing activities, as well as further development and implementation of financial, operational and compliance systems and controls. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenue that is at least proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our gross margins and our future profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy also involves, among other things, launching innovative new products that diversify our product offerings and revenues. This will require us to develop products in areas in which we do not have significant prior experience. We may not be successful in developing new products and if developed and launched, we may not be successful in marketing these new products.\nWe recently expanded our business into Europe and may expand into other geographic areas in the international marketplace, which could increase our operational, regulatory and other risks.\nIn April 2014, we expanded into Europe through the acquisition Boost. In the future, we may expand into other geographic areas. As a result of such expansion, we expect to face increased operational, regulatory, compliance, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of our operating infrastructure to support such expansion, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. If our international products and operations experience any negative results or are perceived negatively in non-U.S. markets, it may also harm our reputation in other markets, including the U.S. market. Future international expansion could require us to incur a number of up-front expenses, including those associated with obtaining regulatory approvals, as well as additional ongoing expenses, including those associated with leases, the employment of additional support staff and regulatory compliance. Operating our business in non-U.S. markets may be more expensive than in the United States. To the extent that our revenues do not increase to the same degree our expenses increase in connection with our expansion outside the United States, our profitability could be adversely affected. Expanding our business into non-U.S. markets may also place significant demands on our existing infrastructure and employees.\nFuture strategic transactions, including business combinations, mergers and acquisitions, may occur at any time, be significant in size relative to our assets and operations, result in significant changes in our business and materially and adversely affect our stock price. Additionally, we may expend significant financial, management time and other resources without the consummation of such transactions or the realization of the anticipated benefits.\nWe believe attractive opportunities for strategic transactions exist, some of which may be material to our operations and financial condition if consummated. We have engaged in the past and expect to continue to engage in the future in strategic discussions that we believe may enable us to strengthen our business, expand and diversify our product offering, increase our AUM or enter into new markets. Such transactions may result in our issuing a significant amount of our common stock or other security that\ncould be dilutive to our stockholders, result in substantial borrowings, result in changes in our board composition and/or management team, constitute a change of control of our Company, lead to significant changes in our product offering, business operations and earning and risk profiles, and/or result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nEven if consummated, such transactions may involve numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve financial, operating or business objectives;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate successfully and in a timely manner any operations, products, services or technology;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention of management and other personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain necessary regulatory, stockholder or other approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nunforeseen liabilities or expenses;\n\u2022\nfailure of counterparties to indemnify us against liabilities arising from such transactions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of, or harm to, our relationship with our and the counterparties\u2019 employees, customers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses;\n\u2022\naccounting charges;\n\u2022\nunfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact the acquired or combined businesses; and\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings, including lawsuits brought by stockholders of us or the counterparties which may result in expenses and/or have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be prevented from, or significantly delayed in, achieving our strategic goals if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses. Our ability to complete future strategic transactions depends upon a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our ability to identify suitable merger or acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and secure financing. Our failure to complete strategic transactions or to integrate and manage acquired or combined businesses successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to retain or recruit key personnel.\nThe success of our business and the implementation of our growth strategy are highly dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled, and sometimes highly specialized, employees, including in particular, operations, product development, research and sales personnel. Our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. The market for these individuals is extremely competitive and is likely to become more so as additional investment management firms enter the ETF industry. Our compensation methods may not enable us to recruit and retain required personnel. In particular, our use of equity grants as a component of total employee compensation may be ineffective if the market price of our common stock declines. Also, we may need to increase compensation levels, which would decrease our net income or increase our losses. If we are unable to retain and attract key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of our products less attractive to investors.\nMany of the WisdomTree ETFs seek to obtain the investment return achieved by our proprietary indexes that weigh index components based upon dividends. Even with the recent increase in income tax rates applicable to dividends, corporate dividends continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment under current U.S. federal income tax law. If the income tax rates imposed on dividends were increased further, it may make these WisdomTree ETFs less attractive to investors.\nOur expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially affect our operating results.\nOur results of operations are dependent in part on the level of our expenses, which can vary from quarter to quarter. Our expenses may fluctuate primarily as a result of discretionary spending, including marketing, advertising and sales expenses we incur to support our growth initiatives. Accordingly, our results of operation may vary from quarter to quarter.\nAny significant limitation, or failure of our technology systems, or of our third party vendors\u2019 technology systems, or any security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could interrupt or damage our operations and result in material financial loss, regulatory violations, reputational harm or legal liability.\nWe are dependent upon the effectiveness of our own, and our vendors\u2019, information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect the technology systems used to operate our business and to protect the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. Although we and our third party vendors take protective measures to secure information, our and our vendors\u2019 technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that could result in inaccuracies in our information or system disruptions or failures, which could materially interrupt or damage our operations. In addition, technology is subject to rapid change and we cannot guarantee that our competitors may not implement more advanced technology platforms for their products, which could affect our business. Any inaccuracies, delays, system failures or breaches, or advancements in technology, and the cost necessary to address them, could subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses or result in material financial loss, regulatory violations, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in our earnings or stock price.\nWe may from time to time in the future be involved in legal proceedings that could require significant management time and attention, possibly resulting in significant expense or in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation. In connection with any litigation in which we are involved, we may be forced to incur costs and expenses in connection with defending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any injunctions in connection therewith if there is an unfavorable outcome. The expense of defending litigation may be significant. The amount of time to resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCatastrophic and unpredictable events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack, war, power failure, cyber-attack, natural disaster or other catastrophic or unpredictable event could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and operating results by: interrupting our normal business operations; inflicting employee casualties, including loss of our key employees; requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair, replace and restore normal business operations; and reducing investor confidence. We have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies, but this plan may not be sufficient in responding or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios. Similarly, these types of events could also affect the ability of the third party vendors that we rely upon to conduct our business, including parties that provide us with sub-advisory portfolio management services custodial, fund accounting and administration services, or index calculation services, to continue to provide these necessary services to us, even though they may also have disaster recovery plans to address these contingencies. If we or our third party vendors are unable to respond adequately or in a timely manner, this failure may result in a loss of revenue and/or increased expenses, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA change of control of our Company would automatically terminate our investment management agreements relating to the WisdomTree ETFs unless the Board of Trustees of the WisdomTree Trust and shareholders of the WisdomTree ETFs voted to continue the agreements. A change in control could occur if a third party were to acquire a controlling interest in our Company.\nUnder the Investment Company Act, an investment management agreement with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment. The fund\u2019s board must vote to continue such an agreement following any such assignment and the shareholders of the WisdomTree ETFs must approve the assignment. The cost of obtaining such shareholder approval can be significant and which ordinarily would be borne by us. Similarly, under the Investment Advisers Act, a client\u2019s investment management agreement may not be \u201cassigned\u201d by the investment adviser without the client\u2019s consent.\nAn investment management agreement is considered under both acts to be assigned to another party when a controlling block of the adviser\u2019s securities is transferred. Under both acts, there is a presumption that a stockholder beneficially owning 25% or more of an adviser\u2019s voting stock controls the adviser and conversely a stockholder beneficially owning less than 25% is presumed not to control the adviser. In our case, an assignment of our investment management agreements may occur if a third party were to acquire a controlling interest in our Company. We cannot be certain that the Trustees of the WisdomTree ETFs would consent to assignments of our investment management agreements or approve new agreements with us if a change of control occurs. And even if such approval were obtained, approval from the shareholders of the WisdomTree ETFs would be required to be obtained; such approval could not be guaranteed and even if obtained, likely would result in significant expense. This restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling interest in our Company.\nWe may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\nThird parties may assert against us alleged patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights to intellectual property that is important to our business. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management from our business. As a result of such intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to:\n\u2022\npay third party infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue selling the particular funds subject to infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue using the processes subject to infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndevelop other intellectual property or products not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible; or\n\u2022\nlicense the intellectual property from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses, reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have been issued a patent and have applied for other patents, but additional patents may not be issued to us and we may not be able to enforce or protect our patents and other intellectual property rights, which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business.\nAlthough we have a patent and have applied for other patents relating to our index methodology and the operation of our ETFs, these other patents may not be issued to us. In addition, even if issued, our ability to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks. While we have been competing without the benefit of these patents being issued, if they are not issued or we cannot successfully enforce them, we may lose the benefit of a future competitive advantage that they would otherwise provide to us. If we seek to enforce our rights, we could be subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid or is otherwise not enforceable. Furthermore, our assertion of intellectual property rights could result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us, which could harm our business. If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may be subject to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor entitled \u201cWe may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\u201d\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndecreases in our AUM;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the investment management industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the ETF industry and the asset management industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour strategic moves and those of our competitors, such as acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory framework of the ETF industry and the asset management industry in general and regulatory action, including action by the SEC to lessen the regulatory requirements or shortening the process to obtain regulatory relief under the Investment Company Act that is necessary to become an ETF sponsor;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions; and\n\u2022\nrealization of any other of the risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn addition, stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, in the past, market fluctuations and price declines in a company\u2019s stock have led to securities class action litigations or other derivative stockholder lawsuits. If such a suit were to arise, it could cause substantial costs to us and divert our resources regardless of the outcome.\nIf equity research analysts issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control the opinions of these analysts. The price and trading volume of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nFuture issuances of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, either in connection with an acquisition or for other business reasons. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe members of our Board of Directors, their affiliates and our executive officers, as stockholders, can exert significant influence over our Company.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, as stockholders, collectively beneficially owned approximately 19.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this ownership, they have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our Company, including the election of directors. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nAlthough our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (i) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our Board of Directors and a majority of our disinterested directors, or a committee consisting solely of disinterested directors, approves the transaction, (ii) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approves the transaction, or (iii) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Under our certificate of incorporation, representatives of our stockholders are not required to offer to us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as a director of ours. The listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, upon which our common stock is listed, also require that certain transactions in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest must be considered and approved by our Audit Committee, which consists solely of independent directors.\nA provision in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our Board of Directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.\nThe payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our financial condition, and any applicable laws.\nIn November 2014, we commenced a quarterly cash dividend and intend to continue to pay regular dividends to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, increase or decrease the level of dividends. Further, our Board of Directors has the discretion to discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. Any determination as to the payment of dividends, as well as the level of such dividends, will depend on, among other things, general economic and business conditions, our level of AUM, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, new credit facilities or other agreements that could limit the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay and any applicable laws. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient income from our business, we may need to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect our stock price.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, determine. Our Board of Directors could, therefore, issue preferred stock with dividend rights superior to that of the common stock, which could also limit the payment of dividends on the common stock.", "PERMNO": 77217, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "WETF"}
