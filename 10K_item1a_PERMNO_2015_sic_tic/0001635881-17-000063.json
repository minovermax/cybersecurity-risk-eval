{"cik": "1635881", "company": "Exterran Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in Part I (\u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d), this report contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nLow oil and natural gas prices could depress or reduce demand or pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment and services and, as a result, adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production.\nOil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $2.28 per MMBtu at December 31, 2015, which was approximately 27% and 47% lower than prices at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was approximately $4.72 per MMBtu for the month of November 2015, which was approximately 16% and 56% lower than prices for the months of December 2014 and 2013, respectively. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. A reduction in demand for our products and services could also force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the low oil and natural gas price environment during 2015 and the majority of 2016, our customers sought to reduce their capital and operating expenditure requirements, and as a result, the demand and pricing for the equipment we manufacture was adversely impacted. Moreover, a reduction in demand for our products and services could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by canceling contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, determining not to enter into new contract operations service contracts or purchase new compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, or canceling or delaying orders for our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In periods of volatile commodity prices, the timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our oil and gas product sales segment, in 2017 and beyond is limited. If reduced booking levels persist for a sustained period, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and development activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by reducing prices under or cancelling contracts with us, determining not to renew contracts with us, cancelling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, determining not to enter into contract operations agreements or not to purchase new compression and oil and natural gas production and processing equipment, or determining to cancel or delay orders for our products and services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nFailure to timely and cost-effectively execute on larger projects could adversely affect our business.\nSome of our projects have a relatively larger size and scope than the majority of our projects, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products and services. Contracts with our customers for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to estimate the cost of and execute such larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur losses on fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of our product sales businesses.\nIn connection with projects and services performed under fixed-price contracts, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance, unless additional costs result from customer-requested change orders. Under both our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we may rely on third parties for many support services, and we could be subject to liability for their failures. For example, we have experienced losses on certain large manufacturing projects that have negatively impacted our product sales results. Any failure to accurately estimate our costs and the time required for a fixed-price manufacturing project at the time we enter into a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are many risks associated with conducting operations in international markets.\nOur contract operations, aftermarket services and Belleli EPC product sales businesses, and a portion of our oil and gas product sales business, are conducted in countries outside the U.S. We currently operate in approximately 30 countries. The countries with our largest contract operations businesses include Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries where we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in 2009 Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (\u201cPDVSA\u201d), the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, assumed control over substantially all of our assets and operations in Venezuela.\nThe countries with our largest contract operations businesses include Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. We generate a significant portion of our revenue in these countries from national oil companies, including Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (\u201cYPF\u201d) in Argentina, Petroleos Mexicanos (\u201cPemex\u201d) in Mexico and Petrobras in Brazil.\nIn April 2012, Argentina assumed control over its largest oil and gas producer, YPF. We are unable to predict what effect, if any, the nationalization of YPF will have on our business in Argentina going forward, or whether Argentina will nationalize additional businesses in the oil and gas industry; however, the nationalization of YPF, the nationalization of additional businesses or the taking of other actions listed below by Argentina could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. More generally in Argentina, the ongoing social, political, economic and legal climate has given rise to significant uncertainties about the country\u2019s economic and political future. The Argentine government may adopt additional regulations or policies in the future that may impact, among other things, (i) the timing of and our ability to repatriate cash from Argentina to the U.S. and other jurisdictions, (ii) the value of our assets and business in Argentina and (iii) our ability to import into Argentina the materials necessary for our operations. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Argentina and may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPemex is a decentralized public entity of the Mexican government, and, therefore, the Mexican government controls Pemex, as well as its annual budget, which is approved by the Mexican Congress. The Mexican government may cut spending in the future. These cuts could adversely affect Pemex\u2019s annual budget and its ability to engage us in the future or compensate us for our services. In 2014, the Mexican government implemented an energy industry reform that will allow the government to grant non-Mexican companies the opportunity to enter into contracts and licenses to explore and drill for oil and natural gas in Mexico. Any impact from this reform on our business in Mexico is uncertain. Also, during the past several years, incidents of security disruptions in many regions of Mexico have increased, including drug cartel related activity. Certain incidents of violence have occurred in regions we serve and have resulted in the temporary disruption of our operations. These disruptions could continue or increase in the future. To the extent that such security disruptions continue or increase, our operations will continue to be affected, and the levels of revenue and operating cash flow from our Mexican operations could be reduced.\nA significant number of senior executives at Petrobras, a government-controlled energy company, have resigned their positions in connection with a widely publicized corruption investigation. In addition, Petrobras recently announced further reductions to its long-term capital expenditures budget. We expect these developments to disrupt Petrobras\u2019 operations in the near term, which could in turn adversely affect our business and results of operations in Brazil.\nWe also have operations in Nigeria, a business environment which has and may experience, among other things, work stoppages, negative corporate payment behavior, currency controls or restrictions, uncertainty in its institutional framework, political unrest, corruption and civil uprisings.\nWith respect to any particular country in which we operate, the risks inherent in our activities may include the following, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing international operations, including our ability to timely and cost effectively execute projects;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, laws or policies by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ntraining and retaining qualified personnel in international markets;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nactions by governments or national oil companies that result in the nullification or renegotiation on less than favorable terms of existing contracts, or otherwise result in the deprivation of contractual rights, and other difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that: result in restricting the movement of property or that impede our ability to import or export parts or equipment; require a certain percentage of equipment to contain local or domestic content; or require certain local or domestic ownership, control or employee ratios in order to do business in or obtain special incentives or treatment in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially longer receipt of payment cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including general political unrest, the nationalization of energy related assets, civil uprisings, riots, kidnappings, violence associated with drug cartels and terrorist acts;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences or tax law changes;\n\u2022\ncurrency controls or restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of property without fair compensation;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our international customers may have reduced access to credit because of higher interest rates, reduced bank lending or a deterioration in our customers\u2019 or their lenders\u2019 financial condition;\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with installing, operating and repairing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nthe geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing new international offices and the risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we may expand our business in international markets where we have not previously conducted business. The risks inherent in establishing new business ventures, especially in international markets where local customs, laws and business procedures present special challenges, may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce profits from international operations and the value of our international net assets.\nWe operate in many international countries. We anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. We have not historically entered into significant hedges to limit our exposure to the risk of exchange rate losses. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currency other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency are included in our statements of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our material exchange rate exposure relates to intercompany loans to subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Brazilian Real, which loans carried balances of $41.0 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. As we expand geographically, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Further, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks.\nThe restatement of our prior financial statements may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor and counterparty confidence.\nWe have restated our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (including the unaudited quarterly periods within 2015 and 2014) to correct accounting errors primarily related to our Belleli EPC product sales segment and non-income-based tax receivables in Brazil. As a result of the circumstances giving rise to the restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the attention of our management team was diverted by these efforts. The SEC is conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the restatement. We could be subject to further regulatory, or stockholder or other actions in connection with the restatement in the future. The current SEC investigation and any future proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, continue to consume management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation and could cause our current and potential lenders, investors and counterparties to lose confidence in us. Each of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in governmental and internal investigations, which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties, as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition.\nIn March 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors retained legal counsel to conduct an internal investigation related to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to specific Belleli EPC product sales projects in the Middle East. On April 26, 2016, we filed a Form 8-K reporting the errors and possible irregularities at Belleli EPC. Contemporaneously with filing the Form 8-K, we self-reported these issues to the SEC. We are cooperating with the SEC in its investigation of this matter, including responding to a subpoena for documents related to the circumstances giving rise to the restatement as well as documents related to our compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which are also being provided to the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) at its request. The FCPA related requests in the SEC subpoena pertain to our policies and procedures, information about our third-party sales agents, and documents related to historical internal investigations completed prior to November 2015. We also have made the SEC and DOJ aware of our internal investigation regarding prior year non-income-based tax receivables due to us from the Brazilian government.\nThe government investigations are continuing, and we are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or results of them or whether the SEC or DOJ will commence any legal actions. If we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes, including the FCPA, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. The imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d management has identified and evaluated control deficiencies that gave rise to the accounting errors related to Belleli EPC product sales projects and non-income-based tax receivables in Brazil, and has concluded that those deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016.\nWe are in the process of implementing a remediation plan to address these material weaknesses. If our remediation efforts are insufficient or not completed in a timely manner, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in lender, investor and counterparty confidence.\nOur outstanding debt obligations could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $351.3 million in outstanding debt obligations. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and those listed in the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section included in Part I of this report.\nOur debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on our debt are based upon variable interest rates and can adjust based upon our credit statistics;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow additional funds.\nIf we are unable to refinance our term loan when due on acceptable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOf the $351.3 million in outstanding debt obligations that we had at December 31, 2016, $232.8 million represents the principal amount outstanding under our term loan facility that is due in November 2017. At or prior to the time the term loan matures, we will be required to refinance it and may enter into one or more new facilities, which could result in higher borrowing costs, issue equity, which would dilute our existing shareholders, repay with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, issue bonds with restrictive covenants that could impact our business flexibility or otherwise raise the funds necessary to repay the outstanding principal amount under the term loan. We have the intent and ability to refinance the principal amount due under the term loan with borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. In connection with the Spin-off, our wholly owned subsidiary, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. (\u201cEESLP\u201d), contributed to a subsidiary of Archrock the right to receive, promptly following the occurrence of a qualified capital raise, a $25.0 million cash payment. No assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into new facilities or issue equity or bonds in the future on attractive terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance the remaining principal amount outstanding under our term loan, we would need to take other actions, including selling assets or seeking strategic investments from third parties, potentially on unfavorable terms, and deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. To the extent that we are unable to refinance our term loan or are required to take any such other action, we would experience a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nCovenants in our credit agreement may impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit agreement, consisting of a $680.0 million revolving credit facility expiring in November 2020 and a $232.8 million term loan facility expiring in November 2017, contains various covenants with which we, EESLP and our respective restricted subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. Additionally, we are required to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. If we fail to remain in compliance with these restrictions and financial covenants, we would be in default under our credit agreement. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impact our ability to perform our obligations under our credit agreement, this could lead to a default. If the repayment obligations on any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms, and our financial position would be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.\nAdditionally, our credit agreement limits our Total Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) ratio on the last day of the fiscal quarter to not greater than 3.75 to 1.0 (which will increase to 4.50 to 1.0 following the completion of a qualified capital raise (as defined in the credit agreement)). As a result of this limitation, $226.9 million of the $504.9 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2016. Because this limitation considers all of our outstanding debt obligations, the additional borrowings available to us are in excess of borrowings needed under our revolving credit facility to refinance the current principal amount due under the term loan facility.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our floating rate debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $350.8 million of outstanding borrowings that are subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to floating interest rates at December 31, 2016 would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of approximately $3.5 million.\nThe termination of or any price reductions under certain of our contract operations services contracts could have a material impact on our business.\nThe termination of or a demand by our customers to reduce prices under certain of our contract operations services contracts may lead to a reduction in our revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be unable to renew, or enter into new, contracts with customers on favorable commercial terms, if at all. To the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms that are favorable to us or to successfully manage our overall contract mix over time, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur product sales backlog may be subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.\nThe revenues projected in our product sales backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of project cancellations or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us or poor project performance could increase the cost associated with a project. Delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce the revenues and reduce or eliminate profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. We may be at greater risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations in the current low oil price environment.\nReductions in our product sales backlog due to cancellation or modification by a customer or for other reasons may adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Many of the contracts in our product sales backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. However, we typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and may be vulnerable to product shortages and price increases.\nSome of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur businesses face intense competition and have low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions and more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services and product sales businesses. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or develop new compression units that would create additional competition for the products, equipment or services we provide to our customers.\nWe also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. As a U.S.-domiciled company, we may also face a higher corporate tax rate than our competitors that are domiciled in other jurisdictions. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy and manufacturing companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator and developer, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, employer\u2019s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur exit from our Belleli EPC business involves numerous risks that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe are in the process of executing a plan to exit the Belleli EPC business to focus on our core oil and gas businesses. While we have ceased booking new orders for our Belleli EPC business, our ultimate exit from this business involves numerous risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In particular, our exit from the Belleli EPC business may take longer or cost more than we currently anticipate. In addition, the reinvestment of any capital received in excess of the costs to complete our exit, and the reallocation of any resources following this process, may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or external expectations. Other parts of our ongoing business could be negatively impacted as we complete the exit of this business, including through the diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through the disruption of relationships with our employees, customers or vendors. Further, we may incur indemnity or other obligations in connection with the business that we are exiting that may cause us to recognize additional expenses in the future.\nCyber-attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by problems such as cyber-attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, similar worldwide anti-bribery laws and trade control laws. If we are found to have violated the FCPA or other legal requirements, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur international operations require us to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. For example, the FCPA and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that experience high levels of corruption, and our business brings us in frequent contact with foreign officials. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. As noted above, in connection with our self-reporting of accounting errors related to our Belleli EPC product sales business to the SEC, we are responding to a subpoena for documents related to that as well as documents related to our compliance with the FCPA, which are also being provided to the DOJ at its request. The FCPA related requests in the SEC subpoena pertain to our policies and procedures, information about our third-party sales agents and documents related to historical internal investigations completed prior to November 2015. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other anti-bribery law violations due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others (including our joint venture partners, agents or other third party representatives), we could suffer from severe civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Separately, we may face competitive disadvantages if our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other advantages by making payments or using other methods that are prohibited by U.S. and international laws and regulations.\nWe also are subject to other laws and regulations governing our operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons and customs requirements. Trade control laws are complex and constantly changing. Our compliance policies and programs increase our cost of doing business and may not work effectively to ensure our compliance with trade control laws. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of trade control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. For example, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect demand for our products.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil, from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule was expected to be effective on June 24, 2015, but, on September 30, 2015, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the rule. In addition, several governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the U.S., although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. In addition, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. The results of this study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 or otherwise.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of, or prohibiting the performance of, drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our products, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to, for example, export controls, currency exchange, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. From time to time, as part of our operations we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various countries in which we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance, any of which may have a negative impact on our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. Certain of these laws also may impose joint and several and strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that may have been lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions. These permits and authorizations may contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits, which may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change policies, laws and regulations focused on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could increase operating costs or reduced the demand for our products and services.\nThere has been an increased focus in the last several years on climate change and the possible role that emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane play in climate change. In the U.S., the EPA has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act and regulatory agencies and legislative bodies in other countries where we operate have adopted greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs restricting greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur higher operating costs or increase the cost of, and thus reduce the demand for, the hydrocarbon products of our customers. These increased costs or reduced demand could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability or results of operations. Further, some scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Such climate events have the potential to adversely affect our operations or those of our clients, which in turn could have a negative effect on us.\nWe may not realize some or all of the benefits we expected to achieve from our separation from Archrock.\nThe expected benefits from our separation from Archrock include the following:\n\u2022\nfocusing on profitable growth in strategic markets and positioning us and our shareholders to benefit from the continued build-out of the global energy infrastructure and the redevelopment currently underway in North America;\n\u2022\nin our international services businesses, relatively stable cash flows due to our limited exposure to the production phase of oil and gas development, particularly when compared to drilling and completion related energy service and product providers;\n\u2022\nlimited capital expenditures in our product sales business;\n\u2022\nfinancial flexibility to enable investment in value-creating contract operations projects; and\n\u2022\nexpanding our potential product sales customer base to include companies in the U.S. contract compression business that have historically been Archrock\u2019s competitors.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our separation for a variety of reasons. For example, we may be unsuccessful in executing our strategy of expanding our product sales customer base to include competitors of Archrock because these prospective customers may have long-standing relationships with existing providers of similar products or services. The availability of shares of our common stock for use as consideration for acquisitions also will not ensure that we will be able to successfully pursue acquisitions or that any acquisitions will be successful. We also may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from our separation if any of the matters identified as risks in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section were to occur. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits from our separation for any reason, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of the Spin-off, we and Archrock are subject to certain noncompetition restrictions, which may limit our ability to grow our business.\nIn connection with the completion of the Spin-off, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Archrock that contains certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions for a limited period of time after the Spin-off on our ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services in the U.S. and on Archrock\u2019s ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services outside of the U.S. and product sales to customers worldwide, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions limit our ability to attract new contract operations and aftermarket services customers in the U.S., which will limit our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, if we are unable to enforce the limitations on Archrock\u2019s ability to provide certain contract operations, aftermarket services and product sales, we may lose prospective customers to Archrock, which could cause our results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nWe provide Archrock and its affiliates with certain manufactured products that we expect will generate recurring oil and gas product sales revenues for us.\nAs a result of the Spin-off, Archrock and its affiliates are among our largest customers and are expected to generate recurring oil and gas product sales revenues for us. Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of Archrock and its affiliates. If Archrock and its affiliates are unable to satisfy its obligations or reduces its demand under our commercial agreements for any reason, our revenues would decline and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, we have no control over Archrock and its affiliates, and Archrock and its affiliates may elect to pursue a business strategy that does not favor us or our business.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our credit agreement. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders\u2019 ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of Archrock.\nCertain tax liabilities of Archrock may become our obligations. Under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Archrock consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spin-off is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Archrock consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Archrock that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Archrock consolidated tax reporting group between us and Archrock. If Archrock is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nThe tax treatment of the Spin-off is subject to uncertainty. If the Spin-off does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, Archrock and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liability and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Archrock for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIf the Spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we, Archrock and/or our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liability. Archrock obtained an opinion of external legal counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Spin-off should qualify as a reorganization under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, subject to certain qualifications and limitations. Accordingly, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Archrock should not recognize any material gain or loss and our shareholders generally should recognize no gain or loss or include any amount in taxable income (other than with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares) as a result of the Spin-off.\nNotwithstanding the opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the Spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings we or Archrock has made is not correct or has been violated, or that the Spin-off should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Spin-off. If the Spin-off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the Spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Archrock would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of our common stock distributed to Archrock shareholders on the Spin-off date over Archrock\u2019s tax basis in such shares of our common stock, and Archrock could incur other significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nUnder the terms of the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Archrock in connection with the Spin-off, if the Spin-off were determined to be taxable, we may be responsible for all taxes imposed on Archrock as a result thereof if such determination was the result of actions taken after the Spin-off by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders and we may be responsible for 50% of such taxes imposed on Archrock as a result thereof if such determination was not the result of actions taken by us or Archrock. Our obligations under the tax matters agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of Archrock and its subsidiaries under the tax matters agreement, we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if Archrock were to fail to pay them. If we are required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for a tax-free Spin-off.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level taxable gain to Archrock under Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock, Archrock\u2019s stock or the stock of a successor of either occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-off. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Archrock\u2019s stock within two years after the Spin-off are generally presumed to be part of such a plan.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Archrock, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Spin-off from being tax-free. Further, during the two-year period following the Spin-off, without obtaining the consent of Archrock, a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm, we may be prohibited from taking certain specified actions that could impact the treatment of the Spin-off.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the tax matters agreement also provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on Archrock or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Spin-off by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.\nOur prior and continuing relationship with Archrock exposes us to risks attributable to businesses of Archrock.\nArchrock is obligated to indemnify us for losses that third parties may seek to impose upon us or our affiliates for liabilities relating to the business of Archrock that are incurred through a breach of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement by Archrock or its affiliates other than us, or losses that are attributable to Archrock in connection with the Spin-off or are not expressly assumed by us under our agreements with Archrock. Any claims made against us that are properly attributable to Archrock in accordance with these arrangements would require us to exercise our rights under our agreements with Archrock to obtain payment from Archrock. We are exposed to the risk that, in these circumstances, Archrock cannot, or will not, make the required payment.\nIn connection with our separation from Archrock, Archrock will indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we will indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to Archrock, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In the case of Archrock\u2019s indemnity, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or as to Archrock\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with Archrock, Archrock has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in our Registration Statement. Under the separation and distribution agreement, we and Archrock will generally release the other party from all claims arising prior to the Spin-off that relate to the other party's business, subject to certain exceptions. Also pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to remove Archrock as a party to certain of our contracts with third parties, which may result in a renegotiation of such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us. In the event that Archrock remains as a party, we expect to indemnify Archrock for any liabilities relating to such contracts. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Archrock will not be subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off.\nWith respect to Archrock\u2019s, agreement to indemnify us, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Archrock will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Archrock will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Archrock any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Archrock or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that Archrock or any of its subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing our common stock or taking other action as part of the Spin-off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the borrowings incurred by us under the new credit facility in connection with the Spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the Spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Archrock or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) lacked reasonably sufficient capital to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the Spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. If such court made this determination, the court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, voiding our liens and claims, if any, against Archrock, or providing Archrock with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Archrock and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than (i) the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or (ii) the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Archrock or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nUnder the separation and distribution agreement, each of Archrock and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Archrock, particularly if Archrock were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nWe were not in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s requirements for continued listing and as a result our common stock may be delisted from trading, which would have a material effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe were delinquent in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, as a result of which we were not in compliance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). By filing our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, we have been advised by the NYSE that we have adequately remediated our non-compliance with the NYSE\u2019s rules. However, we delayed our annual meeting of stockholders as a result of the restatement, and to the extent we cannot hold our annual meeting before the end of 2017, our stock may again be subject to delisting from trading on the NYSE. If our common stock is delisted, there can be no assurance as to whether or when our common stock would again be listed for trading on NYSE or any other exchange. The market price of our shares may also decline and become more volatile if our common stock is delisted, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.", "PERMNO": 15710, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "EXTN"}
