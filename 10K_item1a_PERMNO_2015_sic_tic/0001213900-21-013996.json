{"cik": "1448431", "company": "OptimizeRx Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Business and Financial Condition\nBecause we have historically experienced losses, if we are unable to achieve profitability, our financial condition and company could suffer.\nWhile we were profitable for the full year of 2018 and in the fourth quarter of 2020, since the inception of our business we have historically incurred losses as a result of investing in growth. We incurred losses in 2019 and 2020 as a result of our increased spending to invest in growth - both through additional new hires, as well as through the acquisition of RMDY. While we have increased revenues significantly, we have not yet consistently achieved profitability due to significant investments in our growth, and non-cash expenses. Our ability to achieve consistent profitability depends on our ability to generate sales through our technology platform and advertising model, while maintaining reasonable expense levels. If we do not achieve sustainable profitability, it may impact our ability to continue our operations.\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends on the expertise of our executive officers and certain other key technical personnel. It may be difficult to find sufficiently qualified individuals to replace management or other key technical personnel in the event of death, disability or resignation, thus frustrating our ability to implement our business plan, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, our ability to expand operations to accommodate our anticipated growth will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified media, management, finance, marketing, sales and technical personnel. However, competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. If we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to obtain, retain or attract additional customers could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan.\nWe currently work with many leading pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, medtech, associations, and other companies. Our failure to retain existing customers or expand with new customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe are dependent on a concentrated group of customers.\nOur revenues are concentrated in less than 50 customers, primarily large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a negative impact on our operating results. In both 2020 and 2019, we had three customers that each represented slightly over 10% of our revenues; however only one customer represented over 10% of our revenues in both years.\nWe may be unable to support our technology to further scale our operations successfully.\nOur plan is to grow rapidly through further integration of our technology in electronic platforms. Our growth will place significant demands on our management and technology development, as well as our financial, administrative and other resources. We cannot guarantee that any of the systems, procedures and controls we put in place will be adequate to support the commercialization of our operations. Our operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our solutions, services and operations, then the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain our contracts with electronic prescription platforms, our business will suffer.\nWe are reliant upon our contracts with leading electronic prescribing platforms and electronic health record systems to generate our revenues received from customers Such arrangements subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf Our contract partners may experience financial, regulatory or operational difficulties, which may impair their ability to focus on and fulfill their contract obligations to us;\n\u25cf Legal disputes or disagreements, including the ownership of intellectual property, may occur with one or more of our partners and may lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration;\n\u25cf Significant changes in a partner\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a partner\u2019s willingness or ability to satisfy obligations under any such arrangement; and\n\u25cf A partner could terminate the partnership arrangement, which could negatively impact our ability to sell our solutions and achieve revenues.\nWe will need to maintain these relationships as well as diversify them. The inability to do so could adversely impact our business. We generated 52.7% and 37.4% of our revenue through our largest partner in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur agreements with electronic prescription platforms and electronic health record systems are subject to audit.\nOur agreements with our partners provide for revenue sharing payments to the platform partners based on the revenue we generate through the platform. These payments are subject to audit by our partners, at their cost, and if there is a dispute as to the calculation, we may be liable for additional payments. If an underpayment is determined to be in excess of a certain amount, for example 10%, some agreements would require us to pay for the cost of the audit, as well.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated applications, features and services for our portals may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.\nAttracting and retaining users of our portals requires us to continue to improve the technology underlying those portals and to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services for those portals. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential users and clients. The costs of development of these enhancements may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our portals and related applications, features and services. Our development and/or implementation of new technologies, applications, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts spent.\nIf we are unable to adhere to the regulatory and competitive climate in which we operate, we could be materially and negatively impacted.\nDue to the labyrinth of regulations in healthcare space, state and federal, as well as political sensitivity of healthcare delivery, our business model could be negatively impacted or fail.\nThe markets in which we operate are competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid change.\n\u25cf Our portals face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with online services and websites that provide savings on medications and healthcare products, including both commercial sites and not-for-profit sites. We compete for advertisers and sponsors with: health-related web sites; general purpose consumer web sites that offer specialized health sub-channels; other high-traffic web sites that include both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services; search engines that provide specialized health searches; and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple sites.\n\u25cf Our healthcare provider portals compete with: providers of healthcare decision-support tools and online health management applications; wellness and disease management vendors; and health information services and health management offerings of healthcare benefits companies and their affiliates.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. These organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form. Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which our public portals participate, we expect that competitors will continue to enter these markets.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nMost of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. We are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship revenue.\nGeneral reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u25cf Government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, payers or other healthcare industry participants, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services;\n\u25cf Government regulation prohibiting the use of coupons by patients covered by federally funded health insurance programs;\n\u25cf Consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u25cf Reductions or changes in governmental funding for healthcare;\n\u25cf Adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants; and\n\u25cf A move to a single-payer healthcare system in the U.S.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example, use of our solutions and services could be affected by:\n\u25cf Changes in the design of health insurance plans;\n\u25cf A decrease in the number of new drugs or medical devices coming to market;\n\u25cf A decrease in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies; and\n\u25cf Payor pressure to move to generic brands.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to solutions and services of the types we provide.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our solutions and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nFuture acquisitions may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWhile we currently do not have any immediate arrangements, commitments or understandings regarding any future acquisitions, as part of our strategy for growth, we may continue to explore acquisitions or strategic alliances, which may not be completed or may not be ultimately beneficial to us. Acquisitions may pose risks to our operations, including:\n\u25cf problems and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, or products of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs;\n\u25cf failure to achieve anticipated increases in revenues and profitability;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers and customers and those of the acquired company;\n\u25cf acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technical advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company;\n\u25cf volatility associated with accounting for earn-outs in a given transaction;\n\u25cf entering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience; and\n\u25cf adversely affecting our internal control over financial reporting before the acquiree\u2019s complete integration into our control environment.\nIn addition, in connection with any acquisitions or investments we could:\n\u25cf issue stock that would dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership percentages;\n\u25cf incur debt and assume liabilities;\n\u25cf obtain financing on unfavorable terms, or not be able to obtain financing on any terms at all;\n\u25cf incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u25cf reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or for other purposes.\nThe failure to successfully integrate any acquisitions in an efficient or timely manner may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results, or we may not be able to fully realize anticipated savings. In addition, our competitors could try to emulate our acquisition strategy, leading to greater competition for scarce acquisition targets and could lead to larger competitors if they succeed in emulating our strategy.\nThe global pandemic may disrupt our business or the business of our customers.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of corona virus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19 was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency and Global Pandemic. COVID-19 has severely impacted economies around the world. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful, or that our business operations, or the operations of our customers will not be materially and adversely affected by the consequences of the pandemic. This could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have had material weaknesses in the past that have been remediated as of December 31, 2020. There is no guarantee that material weakness could not arise in the future. If additional material weaknesses were to be identified, it could result in our consolidated financial statements containing material misstatements in the future.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others.\nWe seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published, or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our solutions that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our solutions and processes. In the event a competitor or other party successfully challenges our solutions, processes, patents or licenses or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property, we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims, be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely substantially on trade secrets, proprietary technology, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements, and technical measures to protect our technology, application, design, and manufacturing know-how, and work actively to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position. We cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property and other contractual agreements for our business will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around patents that we may receive, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated.\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the United States. In addition to the risks that we face in the United States, our international operations, as a result of our acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 wherein we now operate in Israel and Croatia, may involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf management distraction;\n\u25cf natural or man-made disasters, political, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19), boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;\n\u25cf compliance with United States laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or the application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities given inter-company transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u25cf profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u25cf differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u25cf new and different sources of competition;\n\u25cf different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; and\n\u25cf availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, as well as results of our operations.\nOur business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable.\nA reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our solutions to our users, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our systems could also be subject to viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct. We might not carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage. Any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of our solutions or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions, then our solutions and services could be less attractive to our users and our business would be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur progress is expected to require the full utilization of our management, financial and other resources. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand operations, including our financial and management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage personnel. There can be no absolute assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively.\nIf we do not properly manage the growth of our business, we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies and industries grow quickly. If our business or industry grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our solutions. Our failure to properly manage the growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations, and our reputation with our current or potential customers.\nOur business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal and state entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities have continued to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Complying with these new regulations has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative costs and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating and other business activities to compliance activities.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nIf a market for our common stock is not maintained, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is traded under the symbol \u201cOPRX\u201d on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We do not currently have a consistent active trading market. There can be no assurance that a consistent active and liquid trading market will develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained.\nHistorically, our securities have been thinly traded. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur stock price is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Technological innovations or new solutions and services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Government regulation of our solutions and services;\n\u25cf The establishment of partnerships with other healthcare companies;\n\u25cf Intellectual property disputes;\n\u25cf Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf Sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf Our ability to integrate operations, technology, solutions, and services;\n\u25cf Our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf Operating results below or exceeding expectations;\n\u25cf Whether we achieve profits or not;\n\u25cf Loss or addition of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf Industry developments;\n\u25cf Economic and other external factors; and\n\u25cf Period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will occur only if our stock price appreciates.\nProvisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nMembers of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17895, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OPRX"}
