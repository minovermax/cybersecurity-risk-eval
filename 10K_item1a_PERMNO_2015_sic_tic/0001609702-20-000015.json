{"cik": "1609702", "company": "CDK Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing, numerous unprecedented measures to try to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the workforce and operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The ultimate impact and efficacy of current containment and mitigation measures and potential future measures is currently unknown.\nThere is considerable uncertainty regarding the direct and indirect business impacts from such measures and potential future measures. We have been able to continue to conduct our business on a relatively normal basis to date while implementing business process modifications to protect our employees and customers, such as travel mobility restrictions and work-from-home and social distancing policies. Restrictions on product installation operations or workforce can impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if prolonged. Our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, restrictions on their ability to operate in addition to reduced automotive retail demand. Such reductions in demand directly impact our transaction revenue in addition to negatively impacting the financial health of our customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we provided our customers with pricing concessions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 on most of our subscription-based solutions, including the DMS. The direct financial impact of these concessions was a near-term decrease in cash receipts and a reduction in revenue that will be recognized over the next two years. Any future concessions are likely to have a similar impact. A discussion of the impact of these concessions is provided in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Certain scientists and medical experts have forecasted that a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of COVID-19 may occur in the U.S. in the late third quarter or the fourth quarter of calendar 2020 and continue into calendar 2021, and there is the risk that any second wave may be on a larger scale than the initial wave of COVID-19 that the U.S. has experienced and is currently experiencing. The sustained current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 has caused economic disruption, including wide scale unemployment, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. There is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such slowdown or recession. Risks related to a slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled \u201cWe have customers in over 100 countries, where we are subject to global, regional and country-specific risks that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition,\u201d below, and include the risk that sales within the automotive retail industry will be significantly curtailed for various reasons including the impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and demand, the impact of COVID-19 containment and mitigation measures on consumer's ability to access dealers and purchase vehicles, and the ability to meet customer demand for vehicles due to disruption in the available inventory of vehicles related to supply chain and production disruption caused by measures taken to limit the spread of the virus, which could in turn reduce the number and/or size of actual or potential customers or the money that actual or potential customers are willing or able to spend on our solution portfolio. While consumer demand within the automotive retail industry has improved from the declines seen in April and May of 2020, we continue to see negative impacts on demand within the automotive retail industry, and we expect that slowing economic conditions will continue to negatively impact demand during fiscal 2021, as discussed in the \u201cFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the\nsignificant economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on our business. These expectations are subject to change without warning and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.\nThe pandemic has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. On May 4, 2020, we amended our Credit Agreements to temporarily increase the total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio covenants to enhance our liquidity position given the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the pandemic and ongoing economic uncertainty. Unanticipated consequences of the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and social distancing measures), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, customer support, and other activities, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.\nThe degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the possibility of a \"second wave\" of COVID-19, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, other actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We are similarly unable to predict the degree to which the pandemic will impact our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other partners, and their financial conditions, but a material effect on these parties could also adversely affect us. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in the Risk Factors sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. Developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing, and additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to appropriately respond to currently.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to compete effectively against other providers of technology solutions to automotive retailers, OEMs, and other participants in the automotive retail industry, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCompetition among automotive retail solutions providers is intense. The industry is highly fragmented and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new solutions. We have a variety of competitors both for our integrated solutions and for each of our individual solutions. For example:\n\u2022for our Dealer Management System (\u201cDMS\u201d) solutions in our CDKNA segment, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate, AutoSoft, PBS Systems and various local and regional providers; and\n\u2022for our CDKI segment, DMS competition is principally from local and regional providers.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their solutions than we can to ours. We expect the industry to continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, possibly involving alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost-effective than our solutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket trends influencing the automotive retail industry could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket trends that negatively impact the automotive retail industry may affect our business by reducing the number and/or size of actual or potential customers or the money that actual or potential customers are willing or able to spend on our solution portfolio. Such market factors include:\n\u2022the adverse effect of long-term wage stagnation on the purchasing power of vehicle purchasers and the number of vehicle purchasers;\n\u2022pricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;\n\u2022disruption in the available inventory of vehicles;\n\u2022disruption in the franchised automotive retailer dealership model, including potential disintermediation by emerging business models;\n\u2022reductions in growth or decreases of automotive retailer spend on technology;\n\u2022contractions in the number of franchised automotive retailers;\n\u2022market oversupply of vehicles and declining used-vehicle pricing;\n\u2022the expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of better quality vehicles and longer warranties and the development of shared-use mobility;\n\u2022the cost of gasoline and other forms of energy;\n\u2022the availability and cost of credit to finance the purchase of vehicles and excess negative equity in existing vehicle loans;\n\u2022the effect of adverse macroeconomic conditions on consumer shopping activity;\n\u2022increased federal and other taxation; and\n\u2022reductions in business and consumer confidence.\nSuch market trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket acceptance of and influence over our products and services is concentrated in a limited number of automobile OEMs and consolidated retailer groups, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nAlthough the automotive retail industry is fragmented, a relatively small number of OEMs, consolidated retailer groups and retailer associations exert significant influence over the market acceptance of automotive retail products and services due to their concentrated purchasing activity, their endorsement or recommendation of specific products and services and/or their ability to define technical standards and certifications. For example, our DMSs are certified to technical standards established by OEMs and certain of our products and services are provided pursuant to OEM-designated endorsement or preferred vendor programs. While automotive retailers are generally free to purchase the solutions of their choosing, when an OEM has endorsed or certified a provider of products or services to its associated franchised automotive retailers and if our solutions lack such certification or endorsement, adoption or retention of our products and services among the franchised dealers of such OEM could be materially impaired.\nWe may be unable to develop and bring products and services in development to market, or bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or at all.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to bring to market new products and services, and enhancements thereto that address evolving customer demands. The successful development of Drive Flex, for example, is important to our future product strategy. The time, expense, and effort associated with developing and offering Drive Flex, Fortellis, and other new and enhanced products and services may be greater than anticipated. The length of the development cycle varies depending on the nature and complexity of the product, the availability of development, product management, and other internal resources and the role, if any, of strategic partners. If we are unable to develop and bring to market additional products and services, and enhancements thereto, in a timely manner, or at all, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to offer these new products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy could negatively impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition depend on our ability to execute our business strategy, which includes the following key elements:\n\u2022deepening relationships with our existing customer base;\n\u2022continuing to expand our customer base;\n\u2022delivering on our business transformation initiatives;\n\u2022strengthening and extending our solutions through intelligence and innovation;\n\u2022developing and delivering our next generation of solutions;\n\u2022selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions; and\n\u2022building and maintaining a culture of performance and accountability.\nWe may not succeed in implementing a portion or all of our business strategy, and even if we do succeed, our strategy may not have the favorable impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition that we anticipate. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business or achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully avail ourselves of the market opportunity for our solution portfolio. If we are unable to adequately implement our business strategy, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe are dependent on our key management, direct sales force, and technical personnel for continued success.\nOur global senior management team is concentrated in a small number of key members, and our future success depends to a meaningful extent on the services of our executive officers and other key team members, including members of our direct sales force and technology staff. Generally, our executive officers and employees can terminate their employment relationship at any time. The loss of any key employees or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business and prospects.\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Disruptions in future leadership transitions or reorganizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other key executives.\nCompetition for qualified leadership and technical personnel in the technology industry is intense, and we compete for leadership and technical personnel with other technology companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified leadership and technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we are able to do so. Any difficulty in hiring or retaining needed personnel, or increased costs related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nReal or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems could negatively impact our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of numerous proprietary and third-party technologies to deliver our solution portfolio. If one or more of those technologies cannot scale to meet demand, or if there are human or technological errors in our execution of any feature or functionality using any such technologies, then our business may be harmed. Because our software is often complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our solutions may not be found until the software or service is in active use by us or our customers. Moreover, our customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our solutions, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely impact the perceived utility of our solutions as well as our brand. Any of these real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which, along with the costs of responding to such effects, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nData security concerns relating to our technology or services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our products and services. If our security measures fail to protect our customers' data from unauthorized access and disclosure, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. A significant breach of the data security of our customers\u2019, vendors\u2019 or other partners\u2019 information technology systems may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe handle substantial amounts of confidential information, including personal information of our employees and of our customers' consumers and employees. Our success depends on the confidence of OEMs, dealers, lenders, major credit reporting agencies and other data providers, and other users of (or participants in) our solutions, in our ability to store, process, and transmit this confidential information securely (whether over the internet or otherwise), and to operate our computer systems and operations without significant disruption or failure.\nOur computer systems experience cyber-attacks and data security incidents of varying degrees on a regular basis. These events may lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse, or theft of data that we store, process and transmit. Our security measures may also fail to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data may be exfiltrated and improperly disclosed or used due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors, or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, their products, or otherwise. While security measures are in place, if our security measures fail to prevent unauthorized access to such data, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and our customers may curtail or stop using our solutions and/or vendors may curtail or stop providing their solutions to us. Any failure of, or lack of confidence in, the security of our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDespite our focus on data security, we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to data that we store and process, or to stop disruptions in the transmission or provision of data and communications or other data by us. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the controls used by our solutions to protect data contained, processed in and transferred to or from our, our customers\u2019 and/or our vendors\u2019 databases. While warranties and liabilities are usually limited in our customer and vendor contracts, they or other third parties may seek to hold us liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to their confidential information or non-public personal information of consumers. In addition, while effort has been expanded to have insurance to cover these losses, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or alleviate any problems caused by actual or threatened cyber-attacks or other unauthorized access to such data. Our security measures may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and any failure to prevent the improper use and disclosure of data and/or to adequately alleviate any problems caused by such improper use and disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur customers, vendors and other partners are primarily responsible for the security of their information technology systems, and we rely on them to supply clean data content and/or to utilize our products and services in a secure manner. While we provide guidance and specific requirements of data security in some cases, we do not directly control any of such parties\u2019 cyber security programs and operations. If our customers, vendors and other partners fail to prevent any significant cyber security breaches, their businesses could be disrupted and therefore may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nInterruption or failure of our networks, systems, and infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and/or subject us to litigation or contractual penalties.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our network and systems. From time to time, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, network or system slowdowns and interruptions. These network and system slowdowns and interruptions may interfere with our ability to do business. While the appropriate upgrades to various systems, shoring up backup processes, and other measures to protect against data loss and system failures have been implemented and tested, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience network failures.\nDespite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, cloud computing, transportation, or other services facilities used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited, to natural disasters, war, civil unrest, economic or political developments, pandemics, and weather events.\nSuch network, system or infrastructure failures or disruptions could result in lengthy interruptions in our service and lost revenue opportunities for our customers, which could result in litigation against us and/or our customers may curtail or stop using our solutions or vendors may curtail or stop providing their solutions to us. Additionally, we have service level agreements with certain of our customers that may result in penalties or trigger cancellation rights in the event of a network or system slowdown or interruption. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, extensive and complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, and new laws and regulations and/or changes to existing laws and regulations may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our operations increases our costs and may impede our competitiveness. In addition, failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in applicable jurisdictions or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines or exposure to civil litigation. New regulations and/or changes to existing regulations could require us to modify our business practices, including modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our customers; directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such regulations; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to develop new ones.\nIn addition to the data privacy and security laws and regulations mentioned below, our business is also directly or indirectly governed by domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as information services, telecommunications, antitrust or competition, employment, motor vehicle and manufacturer licensing or franchising, vehicle registration, advertising, taxation, consumer protection, and accessibility. We must also comply with anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and private entities, such as the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and the Criminal Law and Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China. In addition, motor vehicle and manufacturer licensing, franchising and advertising is highly regulated at the state level and is subject to changing legislative, regulatory, political, and other influences. Such state laws are complex and subject to frequent change. The application of this framework of laws and regulations to our business is complex and, in many instances, is unclear or unsettled, which in turn increases our cost of doing business, may interfere with our ability to offer our solutions competitively in one or more jurisdictions and may expose us and our employees to potential fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions. In some cases, our customers may seek to impose additional requirements on our business in efforts to comply with their interpretation of their own or our legal obligations. These requirements may differ significantly from our existing solutions or processes and may require engineering and other costly resources to accommodate.\nIn addition, we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, actions, and audits from regulatory authorities, particularly in the area of competition. On June 22, 2017, the Company received from the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to any agreements between the Company and Reynolds and Reynolds. On April 22, 2019, the Company received a subsequent request to schedule interviews with certain current and former Company employees. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states\u2019 Attorneys General. The Company has responded to the requests and no proceedings have been instituted. At this time, the Company does not have sufficient information to predict the outcome of, or the cost of resolving these investigations.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, or any new investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to new regulations that restrict the manner and extent to which we can control access to our DMS and other software applications and limit what, if anything, we may charge for integration with those applications.\nRevenue from the Partner Program in our CDKNA segment is dependent on the business model of charging third party retail solution providers for integration to our DMS through a program of robust and secure interfaces. Our ability to control the manner in which we provide this robust and secure access to information in our systems, and our pricing model for this service,\nhas been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, dictated and constrained in certain jurisdictions. For example, during our fourth quarter ending June 30, 2019, Arizona, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon passed legislation that requires us to provide access or integrations to our software to read or write data within our systems. The legislation in some of these states purports to impose such requirements on us at our cost and without markup, or even without compensation, to any third party designated by a dealer licensee of our software, regardless of whether the dealer licensee has title to the data on our systems or the right under its software license to authorize non-licensee third parties access to our systems. In addition, each statute imposes administrative and technical requirements that are inconsistent with our current solutions and capabilities. We believe that compliance with such legislation will impair our ability to provide our customers with robust and secure technology solutions and will increase our risk of data security and privacy breaches, system and data integrity problems, and associated adverse competitive, financial, operational, and reputational impacts. Similar legislation has been proposed in other states and additional states may consider or pass similar legislation. We may incur significant legal and regulatory expenses in connection with assessing or challenging the applicability of this legislation to our products and offerings and while we seek legal, regulatory, or policy solutions to address concerns with respect to the validity of the legislation or our ability to comply with it. Ultimately, our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, or any new investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, with this legislation will increase our operating costs and reduce our revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is directly or indirectly subject to, or impacted by, complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, adjustments to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in customer growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nMany U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, a variety of consumer protection, privacy, and data security laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to our business. For example, federal laws and regulations governing privacy and security of consumer information generally apply to our customers and/or to us as a service provider. These include, but are not limited to, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the \"GLB Act\") and regulations implementing its information safeguarding requirements, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the \"CAN-SPAM Act\"), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, applicable Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) telemarketing rules (including the declaratory ruling affirming the blocking of unwanted robocalls), the FTC Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Risk-Based Pricing Rule, Red Flags Rule, and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"). Laws of foreign jurisdictions, such as Canada's Anti-Spam Law and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") similarly apply to our collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of protected data.\nFor example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018 imposes more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and greater penalties for noncompliance than previous laws. While we have made adjustments to our products, services and operations in Europe to comply with the new requirements contained in the GDPR and to facilitate our customers' compliance with the GDPR, we may need to make more adjustments as more clarification and guidance on compliance with the GDPR become available. Any such adjustments may result in costs and expenses, and any failure to meet the requirements of the GDPR may result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious violations). Further, the European Union is expected to replace the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC (\u201cePrivacy Directive\u201d) governing the use of technologies to collect consumer information with the ePrivacy Regulation. The ePrivacy Regulation may impose burdensome requirements around obtaining consent, and impose fines for violations that are materially higher than those imposed under the European Union\u2019s current ePrivacy Directive and related EU member state legislation.\nIn addition to the GDPR in Europe, there is also rapid development of new privacy laws and regulations elsewhere around the globe, including amendments of existing data protection laws to the scope of such laws and penalties for noncompliance. Failure to comply with these international data protection laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant fines, penalties or other liabilities, all of which may cause increased cost of operations or decline in customer growth, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn the U.S., some state laws and regulations have imposed, and others have contemplated imposing, enhanced disclosure obligations and greater restrictions or prohibitions on the use of data than are already contained in federal laws such as the GLB Act and its implementing regulations or the FTC rules described above. For example, a new law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), went into effect on January 1, 2020. CCPA provides California consumers with a\ngreater level of transparency and broader rights and choices with respect to their personal information than those contained in any existing state and federal laws in the U.S. The \u201cpersonal information\u201d regulated by CCPA is broadly defined to include any information that identifies or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked, directly or indirectly, with a California consumer or household, including, for example, demographics, usage, transactions and inquiries, preferences, inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer. Compliance with CCPA requires the implementation of a series of operational measures such as preparing data maps, inventories, or other records of all personal information pertaining to California residents, households and devices, as well as information sources, usage, storage, and sharing, maintaining and updating detailed disclosures in privacy policies, establishing mechanisms to respond to consumers\u2019 data access, deletion, portability, and opt-out requests, etc. Violations of CCPA will result in civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation. CCPA further allows consumers to file lawsuits against a business if a data breach has occurred as a result of the business' violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices.\nThe enforcement of the CCPA commenced on July 1, 2020. In the meantime, significant uncertainties in the interpretation and application some key CCPA provisions remain outstanding. On June 2, 2020, the California Attorney General submitted the draft of the implementation regulations to the CCPA (\u201cCCPA Regulations\u201d) to the California Office of Administration Law for its final approval. Furthermore, the privacy group whose efforts led to the CCPA in 2018 has proposed a new law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which, if passed, would replace the CCPA and impose further compliance burdens and risks on service providers such as us.\nTo comply with CCPA and assist many of our customers who are subject to CCPA to comply with CCPA, we have modified or adjusted the design, development, and delivery of our products and services in a significant way. However, with further clarifications and interpretations of the CCPA, the approval of the CCPA Regulations, and the passage of the CPRA and/or any new laws and regulations, additional modifications and adjustments may be required, which may result in significant costs and expenses, and any delay or failure to make such changes may negatively affect our customers\u2019 confidence in or perception of our product and services, result in their ceasing to use our products or services or even lawsuits and significant liabilities.\nIn addition, all 50 states have passed data breach notification laws that require notifications to affected consumers, attorneys general, consumer protection agencies and/or other government authorities when there is a breach of personal data, and provide consumers with credit monitoring and other remedies. Any data breaches and the related notifications and remedies may result in significant compliance costs in addition to potential liability and reputational damage.\nThe costs and other burdens of compliance with privacy and data security laws and regulations could negatively impact the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Additionally, evolving concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers, or their customers and potential customers, to resist providing the data necessary to allow us to deliver our solutions effectively. Even the perception that personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our solutions and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Any such decrease in demand or incurred fines, penalties, or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business operations may be harmed by events beyond our control.\nOur business operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and pandemics or outbreaks of disease or similar public health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (discussed further in the risk factor \"The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition,\" above), or fears of such events, or from power outages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, computer network service outages and disruptions, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, computer malware and ransomware, break-ins, sabotage, employee error or malfeasance, and other similar events beyond our control. The occurrence of any such event at any of our facilities or at any third-party facility utilized by us or our third-party providers could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data, or could render us unable to provide our solution portfolio. In addition, any failure of a third-party to provide the data, products, services, or facilities required by us, as a result of human error, bankruptcy, natural disaster, or other operational disruption, could cause interruptions to our computer systems and operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe utilize certain key technologies, data, and services from, and integrate certain of our solutions with, third parties and may be unable to replace those technologies, data, and services if they become obsolete, unavailable, or incompatible with our solutions.\nWe utilize certain key technologies and data from, and/or integrate certain of our solutions with, hardware, software, services, and data of third parties, including Chrome Systems, TrueCar, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, EMC, Cisco Systems, Kyocera, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and others. Some of these vendors are also our competitors in various respects. These third-party vendors could, in the future, seek to charge us cost-prohibitive fees for such use or integration or may design or utilize their solutions in a manner that makes it more difficult for us to continue to utilize their solutions, or integrate their technologies with our solutions, in the same manner or at all. Any significant interruption in the supply or maintenance of such third-party hardware, software, services, or data could negatively impact our ability to offer our solutions unless and until we replace the functionality provided by this third-party hardware, software, and/or data. In addition, we are dependent upon these third parties\u2019 ability to enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality or data provided by third-party vendors in the event that such technologies or data becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our solutions or are otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Any delay in or inability to replace any such functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third-party software applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have customers in over 100 countries, where we are subject to country-specific risks that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated 21% of our revenues outside of the U.S. As a result, our business, operations, and financial condition are at times adversely affected by a number of global, regional and country-specific factors outside of our control.\nAdverse changes in global, regional or country specific economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 has caused an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm sustained demand within the automotive retail industry, which in turn may affect our business by reducing the number and/or size of actual or potential customers or the money that actual or potential customers are willing or able to spend on our solution portfolio, and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, and asset impairments.\nBusiness and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, currency exchange controls, repatriation of earnings (as described below) and environmental, and employment laws. For example, the referendum vote held in the U.K. on June 23, 2016 resulted in Brexit. Our results are subject to the uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by Brexit, including uncertainty regarding the U.K.\u2019s access to the EU Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory, and labor environments, especially in the U.K. and EU. Our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our activities across the countries in which we are active. In addition, our operations in each country are vulnerable to changes in local socio-economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies, currency exchange rates, intellectual property protection disputes, the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems, the collection of receivables through foreign legal systems, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, product preference and product requirements, difficulty to effectively establish and expand our business and operations in such markets, unsettled political conditions, possible terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and pandemic disease, such as COVID-19. These and other factors relating to our international operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed by negative rating actions by credit rating agencies.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to the Company and our senior notes. In November 2016, our credit ratings were downgraded to non-investment grade. If our ratings are downgraded further or if ratings agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, it could limit our access to new financing, reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs, adversely affect the market price of our senior notes, result in an increase in financing costs, including interest expense under certain of our debt instruments, and result in less favorable covenants and financial terms in our future financing arrangements. Any of these outcomes could also negatively impact our relationships with our customers or\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additional details about the terms of our debt is contained in Item 8 of Part II, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 - \"Debt.\"\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, involved in litigation that is expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including patent, copyright, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower, antitrust and other litigation and claims, in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements.\nThe Company is currently involved in several lawsuits that set forth allegations of anti-competitive conduct by the Company and anti-competitive agreements between the Company and Reynolds and Reynolds relating to the manner in which the defendants control access to, and allow integration with, their respective DMSs. Any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters relating to the manner in which we control access to, and allow integration with, our DMS, that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We believe these cases are without merit and intend to continue to contest the claims in these cases vigorously.\nBecause litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved, see the information set forth under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our team members and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products and services similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries in which we market our products and services afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, and we may not prevail. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or manage costs associated with enforcing those rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or develop or license substitute technology.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that our technologies in our products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing us with technology that we use in our own technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our products and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that our products and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts, obtain a license to continue to use the products and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, from the third party asserting any particular claim, that we would be able\nto successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, we generally provide in our customer agreements for certain products and services that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology that we provide to those customers, which could obligate us to pay damages if the products and services were ever found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against us, our vendors, or our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions and formed strategic alliances in the past and expect to do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or alliance partners that strengthen our value proposition to customers or to achieve the expected benefits from such acquisitions or alliances, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have historically pursued growth through acquisitions, ranging from acquisitions of small start-up companies that provide a discrete application to a handful of customers, to acquisitions of substantial companies with more mature solutions and a larger customer base, such as our acquisition of ELEAD1ONE (\"ELEAD\") in 2018, which supports our CRM business. As part of our ongoing business strategy to expand solutions offerings, acquire new technologies, and strengthen our value proposition to customers, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures. However, there may be significant competition for acquisition, alliance, and joint venture targets in our industry, or we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate attractive terms, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals for such transactions in the future. Acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was approved or completed.\nEven if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will provide attractive growth opportunities, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks from these transactions include risks relating to:\n\u2022integration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;\n\u2022developing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies, and procedures;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022establishing new informational, operational, and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u2022losing key employees, customers, and vendors;\n\u2022failing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary solutions; and\n\u2022unanticipated or unknown liabilities.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay all or a portion of the purchase prices of future acquisitions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts, others may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the business or assets acquired, which would dilute our existing stockholders' ownership interests. Future acquisitions may also decrease our earnings and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional indebtedness, issue equity, have future impairment of assets or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions.\nWe could be liable for contract or product liability claims, and disputes over such claims may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention, or have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe provide limited warranties to purchasers of our products and services. In addition, errors, defects or other performance problems in our products and services, including with respect to data that we store, process and provide in connection with our products and services, could result in financial or other damages to our customers or consumers. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount; however, there can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or at all, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, any litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, some of our products and services are business-critical for our customers, and a failure or inability to meet a customer\u2019s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to retain existing business or attract new business.\nBecause we recognize a majority of our revenue from our subscription-based products and services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize a majority of our revenue from sales of our subscription-based products and services ratably over the term of the subscription contract. As a result, the majority of our quarterly revenue is attributable to service contracts entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue in that quarter but will harm our revenue in future quarters. Consequently, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our subscription services in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new subscription contracts, and from additional orders under existing subscription contracts, must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, delays or failures in deployment of our subscription services may prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for indeterminate periods of time. Further, we may experience unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services to customers over the term of our subscription contracts as a result of inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors, which may harm our operating results.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting principles may negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and other organizations that develop and interpret accounting principles. New accounting principles arise regularly, implementation of which can have a significant effect on and may increase the volatility of our reported operating results and may even retroactively affect previously reported operating results. In addition, the implementation of new accounting principles may require significant changes to our customer and vendor contracts, business processes, accounting systems, and internal controls over financial reporting. The costs and effects of these changes could adversely impact our operating results, and difficulties in implementing new accounting principles could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nWe conduct transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling, and Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar, can significantly affect our assets, revenues, and operating results. Generally, our revenues are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Similarly, cash, other bank deposits, and other assets held in foreign currency are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens.\nWe may have exposure to unanticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur global business operations subject us to income taxes and non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The computation of the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities is complex, as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment regarding the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under GAAP. The provision for income taxes may require forecasts of effective tax rates for the year, which include assumptions and forward looking financial projections, including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may materially differ from our forecasts. Our provision for income tax could be materially impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the geographical mix of our profits and losses, changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax positions, changes in our intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings, changes in our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation, and changes in our need for deferred tax valuation allowances. Any changes in corporate income tax laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform, could significantly impact our overall tax liability. For these reasons, our actual tax liabilities in a future period may be materially different than our income tax provision.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.\nIn the event that changes in tax laws negatively impact our effective tax rates, our provision for taxes, or generate unanticipated tax liabilities, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material adverse effect.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe income and non-income tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, changes to U.S. tax laws enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and beyond. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Due to our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. federal tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations along with other changes. The U.S. Department of Treasury may issue regulations and interpretative guidance. In addition, the Tax Reform Act has U.S. state and local implications and additional guidance and interpretations are anticipated from state taxing authorities. The issuance of additional regulations and interpretations may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital currently in place will permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future or at all will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022our financial performance;\n\u2022our credit ratings;\n\u2022the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and\n\u2022the state of the economy.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nOur current level of indebtedness could negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have significant debt obligations. On August 17, 2018, we entered into a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (which was drawn by $15.0 million as of June 30, 2020) and borrowed $300.0 million under a three-year term loan facility that will mature on August 17, 2021 and $300.0 million under a five year term loan facility that will mature on August 17, 2023. In addition, we have approximately $2.1 billion of existing senior notes outstanding. See Note 17, \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details about the terms of our debt.\nOur current indebtedness could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment;\n\u2022an increasingly substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to making payments of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of funds that would otherwise be available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases or other corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to further downgrades of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our interest rates on existing indebtedness, cost of additional indebtedness, liquidity and access to capital markets;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022requiring us to secure our credit agreements and other indebtedness and provide subsidiary guarantees if certain conditions are met;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes; and\n\u2022any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which in turn, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.\nOur ability to service our current and future levels of indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including the interest rate environment, and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThere is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs and we may be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, reducing or discontinuing dividends we may pay in the future, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nHigher levels of indebtedness and increased debt service obligations will effectively reduce the amount of funds available for other business purposes and may adversely affect us.\nInterest costs related to the notes will be substantial, and our increased level of indebtedness, including any future borrowings, could reduce funds available for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other business purposes, impact our credit ratings, restrict our financial and operating flexibility or create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels.\nFurther, increased indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may be required, among other things:\n\u2022to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes;\n\u2022to sell selected assets or businesses; or\n\u2022to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\nSuch measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, and meet our other cash requirements. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our business profile and market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of our stockholders, and our common stock may not be included in some indices, causing certain holders to sell their shares;\n\u2022a shift in our investor base;\n\u2022the actions of significant stockholders;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022announcements of acquisitions or dispositions and strategic moves, such as acquisitions or restructurings, by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022changes in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of our industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory framework of our industry and regulatory action;\n\u2022changes in general economic or market conditions, including the impact of COVID-19; and\n\u2022the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenue, operating results, and profitability vary from quarter to quarter, which may result in volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may lead to volatility in our stock price. These variations are due to several factors, including:\n\u2022the timing, size, and nature of our customer revenues and any losses with respect thereto;\n\u2022product and price competition regarding our products and services;\n\u2022the timing of introduction and market acceptance of new products, services or product enhancements by us, or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in our operating expenses;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022the timing of acquisitions or divestitures of businesses, products, and services;\n\u2022the seasonality of car sales;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022personnel changes; and\n\u2022fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions.\nThere is substantial volatility in the domestic and international stock markets that could negatively impact our stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nHolders of our common stock may be adversely affected through the issuance of more senior securities or through dilution.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or issue equity in order to fund working capital, capital expenditures and product development requirements, maintain debt capacity levels, or to make acquisitions and other investments. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have liquidation rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of common equity, the issuance will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. We cannot assure our investors or potential investors that debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain or grow our business.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them more burdensome to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent; and\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nWe have not opted out of the protections afforded by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that a stockholder acquiring more than 15% of our outstanding voting shares (an \u201cInterested Stockholder\u201d) but less than 85% of such shares may not engage in certain business combinations with us for a period of three years subsequent to the date on which the stockholder became an Interested Stockholder unless, prior to such date, our Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder or the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the Interested Stockholder.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at the times or in the amounts we currently anticipate.\nOur Board of Directors has declared, and we have paid, regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The payment of such quarterly dividends and any other future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, as to what the amount of any future dividends will be, or that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any future dividends. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, or increases in reserves. If we do not pay future dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to receive a gain on your investment in us. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nIn January 2017, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. As of June 30, 2020, we have spent a total of approximately $1.5 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock under the authorization. We have funded these repurchases through a combination of free cash flow and incremental borrowings. As intended, such borrowings brought leverage, measured as financial debt, net of cash, divided by adjusted EBITDA, to approximately 3.3x as of June 30, 2020. Our leverage ratio of 3.3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2020, is currently in excess of our target leverage ratio. In addition, on May 4, 2020, we entered into amendments to our credit agreements that restrict us from making repurchases of our common stock in excess of $40.0 million in any fiscal year through the earlier of: (i) delivery of the financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021, provided certain conditions are met; and (ii) the provision of the relevant liens and subsidiary guarantees to the creditor banks. As a result of these conditions, we do not anticipate any material share repurchases in fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase shares of our common stock at the times or in the amounts we currently anticipate due to market conditions, our cash position, our ability to access new financing, applicable laws and other factors, or that the results of the share repurchase program will be as beneficial as we currently anticipate.\nThe interests of significant stockholders may conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders, and their actions could disrupt our business and affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nSince we began operating as an independent public company, three of our stockholders have, at various times, made filings on Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating that they may take positions or make proposals with respect to, or with respect to potential changes in, among other things, our operations, management, management and employee incentives, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the composition of our Board of Directors, ownership, capital allocation policies, capital or corporate structure, dividend policy, potential acquisitions involving us or certain of our businesses or assets, strategy, and plans. Any such positions or proposals may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders. Significant stockholders may be proponents of pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions involve risks to our other stockholders.\nResponding to actions by significant stockholders can be costly, time-consuming, and disrupting to our operations and can divert the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business strategy, including plans relating to, growth strategies, business process improvement, or the return of capital to our stockholders. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our\nsecurities.", "PERMNO": 14926, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CDK"}
