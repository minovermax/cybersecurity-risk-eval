The Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nThe Company\u2019s annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may cause the Company\u2019s share price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s net sales, expenses and operating results may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter for several reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf the ability of the Company\u2019s sales force to effectively market and promote the Company\u2019s products, and the extent to which those products gain market acceptance;\n\u25cf the inability to meet the Company's debt repayment obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the\u201cRevised Revolving Line of Credit\u201d) due to insufficient cash;\n\u25cf the possibility that cybersecurity breaches, data breaches, and other disruptions could compromise our information or result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information;\n\u25cf the existence and timing of any product approvals or changes;\n\u25cf the rate and size of expenditures incurred on the Company\u2019s clinical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and product development efforts;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain personnel;\n\u25cf the availability of key components, materials and contract services, which depends on the Company\u2019s ability to forecast sales, among other things;\n\u25cf investigations of the Company\u2019s business and business-related activities by regulatory or other governmental authorities;\n\u25cf variations in timing and quantity of product orders;\n\u25cf temporary manufacturing interruptions or disruptions;\n\u25cf the timing and success of new product and new market introductions, as well as delays in obtaining domestic or foreign regulatory approvals for such introductions;\n\u25cf increased competition, patent expirations or new technologies or treatments;\n\u25cf impact of the FDA communication letter regarding \u201cvaginal rejuvenation\u201d procedures using energy-based devices on sales of the Company's products;\n\u25cf product recalls or safety alerts;\n\u25cf litigation, including product liability, patent, employment, securities class action, stockholder derivative, general commercial and other lawsuits;\n\u25cf volatility in the global market and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, including changes domestically and internationally, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities;\n\u25cf the impact of the new EU privacy regulations (GDPR) on the Company\u2019s resources;\n\u25cf the financial health of our customers and their ability to purchase our products in the current economic environment; and\n\u25cf other unusual or non-operating expenses, such as expenses related to mergers or acquisitions, may cause operating results to vary.\nAs a result of any of these factors, the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause its share price to fluctuate.\nIf defects are discovered in the Company\u2019s products, the Company may incur additional unforeseen costs, customers may not purchase the Company\u2019s product and the Company\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the quality and reliability of its products. While the Company\u2019s subject components are sourced and products manufactured to stringent quality specifications and processes, the Company\u2019s products incorporate different components including optical components, and other medical device software, any of which may contain errors or exhibit failures, especially when products are first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, the Company and its customers have an increased sensitivity to such defects. In the past, the Company has voluntarily recalled certain products. Although our products are subject to stringent quality processes and controls, the Company cannot provide assurance that its products will not experience component aging, errors, or performance problems. If the Company experiences product flaws or performance problems, any or all of the following could occur:\n\u25cf delays in product shipments\u037e\n\u25cf loss of revenue\u037e\n\u25cf delay in market acceptance\u037e\n\u25cf diversion of our resources\u037e\n\u25cf damage to our reputation\u037e\n\u25cf product recalls\u037e\n\u25cf regulatory actions\u037e\n\u25cf increased service or warranty costs\u037e or\n\u25cf product liability claims.\nCosts associated with product flaws or performance problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe success and continuing development of our products depends, in part, upon maintaining strong relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nIf the Company fails to maintain our working relationships with physicians and other ancillary healthcare and aesthetic professionals, the Company\u2019s products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, and public speakers, and the Company relies on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience. If the Company is unable to maintain these strong relationships, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies heavily on its sales professionals to market and sell its products worldwide. If the Company is unable to hire, effectively train, manage, improve the productivity of, and retain our sales professionals, the Company\u2019s business will be harmed, which would impair its future revenue and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s success largely depends on our ability to hire, train, manage, train, and improve the productivity levels of the Company\u2019s sales professionals worldwide. Because of the Company\u2019s focus on non-core practitioners in the past, several of its sales professionals do not have established relationships with the core market, consisting of dermatologists and plastic surgeons, or where those relationships exist, they are not appropriately strong.\nCompetition for sales professionals who are familiar with, and trained to sell in, the aesthetic equipment market continues to be robust. As a result, the Company occasionally loses our sales people to competitors. The Company\u2019s industry is characterized by a few established companies that compete vigorously for talented sales professionals. Some of its sales professionals leave the Company for jobs that they perceive to be better opportunities, both within and outside of the aesthetic industry. For instance, in the second half of 2018, the Company experienced significant turnover of our sales professionals, including several people in key sales leadership positions. Most of these sales professionals went to work for a competitor. We believe the loss of these sales professionals negatively impacted our sales performance in the second half of 2018. The Company believes it has adequate measures in place to protect our proprietary and confidential information when employees leave our Company, however the ability to enforce these measures varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and we must make a case-by-case decision regarding legal enforcement action. For instance, covenants not-to-compete are not allowed in many states, and if allowed, difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions. Furthermore, such legal enforcement actions are expensive and we cannot give any assurance that these enforcement actions will be successful.\nHowever, the Company also continues to hire and train new sales people, including several from our competitors. Several of the Company\u2019s sales employees and sales management are recently hired or transferred into different roles, and it will take time for them to be fully trained to improve their productivity. In addition, due to the competition for sales professionals in our industry, the Company also recruits sales professionals from outside the industry. Sales professionals from outside the industry typically take longer to train and become familiar with our products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result of a lack of industry knowledge, these sales professionals may take longer to become productive members of our sales force.\nThe Company trains its existing and recently recruited sales professionals to better understand our existing and new product technologies and how they can be positioned against our competitors\u2019 products. These initiatives are intended to improve the productivity of our sales professionals and our revenue and profitability. It takes time for the sales professionals to become productive following their training and there can be no assurance that the newly recruited sales professionals will be adequately trained in a timely manner, or that the Company direct sales productivity will improve, or that the Company will not experience significant levels of attrition in the future.\nMeasures the Company implements in an effort to recruit, retain, train and manage our sales professionals, strengthen their relationships with core market physicians, and improve their productivity may not be successful and may instead contribute to instability in its operations, additional departures from our sales organization, or further reduce our revenue and harm our business. If the Company is not able to improve the productivity and retention of our North American and international sales professionals, then the Company\u2019s total revenue, profitability and stock price may be adversely impacted.\nThe aesthetic equipment market is characterized by rapid innovation. To compete effectively, the Company must develop and/or acquire new products, seek regulatory clearance, market them successfully, and identify new markets for our technology.\nThe aesthetic light and energy-based treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If the Company does not continue to innovate and develop new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications or enhancements to our current products. The Company created products to apply our technology to body contouring, hair removal, treatment of veins, tattoo removal, and skin revitalization, including the treatment of diffuse redness, skin laxity, fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, pore size and benign pigmented lesions, etc. For example, the Company introduced Juliet, a product for women\u2019s intimate health, in December 2017, Secret RF, a fractional RF microneedling device for skin revitalization, in January 2018, enlighten SR in April 2018, and truSculpt iD in July 2018. To grow in the future, the Company must continue to develop and/or acquire new and innovative aesthetic products and applications, identify new markets, and successfully launch the newly acquired or developed product offerings.\nTo successfully expand the Company\u2019s product offerings, the Company must, among other things:\n\u25cf develop or otherwise acquire new products that either add to or significantly improve our current product offerings;\n\u25cf obtain regulatory clearance for these new products;\n\u25cf convince our existing and prospective customers that our product offerings are an attractive revenue-generating addition to their practice;\n\u25cf sell our product offerings to a broad customer base;\n\u25cf identify new markets and alternative applications for our technology;\n\u25cf protect our existing and future products with defensible intellectual property; and\n\u25cf satisfy and maintain all regulatory requirements for commercialization.\nHistorically, product introductions have been a significant component of the Company\u2019s financial performance. To be successful in the aesthetics industry, the Company believes it needs to continue to innovate. The Company\u2019s business strategy is based, in part, on its expectation that the Company will continue to increase or enhance its product offerings. The Company needs to continue to devote substantial research and development resources to make new product introductions, which can be costly and time consuming to its organization.\nThe Company also believes that, to increase revenue from sales of new products, the Company needs to continue to develop its clinical support, further expand and nurture relationships with industry thought leaders, and increase market awareness of the benefits of its new products. However, even with a significant investment in research and development, the Company may be unable to continue to develop, acquire or effectively launch and market new products and technologies regularly, or at all. If the Company fails to successfully commercialize new products or enhancements, its business may be harmed.\nWhile the Company attempts to protect our products through patents and other intellectual property, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with ours. The Company expects that any competitive advantage the Company may enjoy from current and future innovations may diminish over time as companies successfully respond to our, or create their own, innovations. Consequently, the Company believes that it will have to continuously innovate and improve our products and technology to compete successfully. If the Company is unable to innovate successfully, its products could become obsolete and its revenue could decline as its customers and prospects purchase its competitors\u2019 products.\nDemand for our products in any of the Company\u2019s markets could be weakened by several factors, including:\n\u25cf inability to develop and market our products to the core market specialties of dermatologists and plastic surgeons;\n\u25cf poor financial performance of market segments that attempt to introduce aesthetic procedures to their businesses;\n\u25cf the inability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf competitive threat from new innovations, product introductions capturing mind and wallet share\n\u25cf reduced patient demand for elective aesthetic procedures;\n\u25cf failure to build and maintain relationships with opinion leaders within the various market segments; and\n\u25cf the lack of credit financing, or an increase in the cost of borrowing, for some of our potential customers.\nIf the Company does not achieve anticipated demand for our products, there could be a material adverse effect on its total revenue, profitability, employee retention and stock price.\nThe search for a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), may cause uncertainty regarding the future of the Company\u2019s business, impact employee hiring and retention, increase the volatility in our stock price, and adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nOn January 4, 2019, James A. Reinstein resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company\u2019s board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d). Since then the Company\u2019s current Chief Operating Officer, R. Jason Richey has been acting as Chief Operating Officer and Interim CEO.\nThe Board is conducting a search for a new President and CEO. The Board\u2019s search for a President and CEO, and any related speculation and uncertainty regarding our future business strategy and direction in connection with the search and the appointment of a President and CEO, may cause or result in:\n\u25cf\nDisruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management;\n\u25cf\nDifficulty recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel, including a permanent President and CEO;\n\u25cf\nDepartures of other members of management;\n\u25cf\nIncreased stock price volatility; and\n\u25cf\nDifficulty in establishing, maintaining or negotiating business or strategic relationships or transactions.\nIf the Company is unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by the Board\u2019s search for and appointment of a President and CEO, it may disrupt the Company\u2019s business or adversely impact its revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract a qualified permanent President and CEO who has the qualifications to lead the Company or that the Company can hire a President and CEO on acceptable terms.\nThe Company depends on skilled and experienced personnel to operate its global business effectively. Changes to management or the inability to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified personnel, could harm the Company\u2019s ability to successfully manage, develop and expand its business, which would impair the Company\u2019s future revenue and profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the principal members of our management, sales personnel and scientific personnel. For example, in the second half of 2018, the Company experienced significant turnover of our sales professionals, including several people in key sales leadership positions. Most of these sales professionals went to work for a competitor. We believe the loss of these sales professionals negatively impacted our sales performance in the second half of 2018. Additionally, the Company\u2019s product development plans depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in medical devices. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Company may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies and universities. The loss of any of these persons or the Company\u2019s inability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete and become profitable.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company relies on networks, information management software and other technology, or information systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, order processing and collection of payments. The Company uses information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. In addition, the Company depends on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between company personnel as well as customers and suppliers. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business processes may be impacted by system shutdowns or service disruptions. These disruptions may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, computer hackers, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. These events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and the Company business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility, and could expose us to liability. The Company may also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. Like most major corporations, the Company\u2019s information systems are a target of attacks. As of December 2018, we have not had any disruptions to our information systems that have materially affected our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such disruptions will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nChanges in accounting standards and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, inventories, warranties, leases, income taxes and stock-based compensation, are complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or changes in the underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and may retroactively affect previously reported results. For example, recently issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting will result in a significant increase to long-term assets and liabilities given we have a significant number of leases.\nThe Company's ability to access credit on favorable terms, if necessary, for the funding of our operations and capital projects may be limited due to changes in credit markets.\nThe Company recently revised its Revolving Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Original Revolving Line of Credit contained financial and other covenants as well as the maintenance of a leverage ratio not to exceed 2.5 to 1.0 and a TTM adjusted EBITDA of not less than $10 million. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company determined that it was in violation of certain financial covenants in the Original Revolving Line of Credit. Upon receipt of this notice, we entered into discussions with Wells Fargo to amend and revise certain terms of the Original Revolving Line of Credit. Following the end of the Company\u2019s third quarter, on or about November 2, 2018, it entered into a First Amendment and Waiver to the Loan and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo (the \u201cFirst Amended Revolving Line of Credit\u201d). The First Amended Revolving Line of Credit provided for an original principal amount of $15 million, with the ability to request an additional $10 million and a waiver of any existing defaults under the Original Revolving Line of Credit as long as the Company is in compliance with the terms of the First Amended Revolving Line of Credit, including revised financial and other covenants as well.\nSubsequent to December 2018, the Company again determined that it was in violation of certain financial covenants in the First Amended Revolving Line of Credit. We again entered into discussions with Wells Fargo to amend and revise certain terms of the First Amended Revolving Line of Credit. On or about, March 11, 2019 the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver to the Loan and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo (the \u201cSecond Amended Revolving Line of Credit\u201d). The Second Amended Revolving Line of Credit requires the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of $15 million at Wells Fargo, but removes all other covenants so long as no money is drawn on the line of credit. At such time as the Company elects to draw on the Second Amended Revolving Line of Credit, however, the Company must be in compliance with the various financial covenants or it will not be able to access the credit.\nAdditionally, although the Company does not currently carry any debt, in the past, the credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced disruption characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions, increased volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability and intervention from the U.S. and other governments. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term or widespread downturn, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the global commercial and residential real estate markets and related mortgage markets and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility. The cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by these conditions. The Company cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from our existing financial institutions and the credit markets if needed, and if available, to the extent required and on acceptable terms. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates on May 30, 2021 and if the Company cannot renew or refinance this facility or obtain funding when needed, in each case on acceptable terms, such conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to report timely and accurate information could be negatively impacted by its plan to implement a new accounting and enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system.\nThe Company is in the process of implementing a new accounting and ERP system. The Company has not previously had a comprehensive ERP system and to date has relied on a myriad of non-integrated systems, as well as manual processes. A system implementation of this magnitude entails a significant degree of inherent risk. The key elements of this implementation include the conversion of data from existing systems to the new system and the design of the new system to process and report financial and other transactions in an accurate and complete manner. If these, or other aspects of the implementation are not executed successfully, then its ability to report timely and accurate information could be negatively impacted. Failure to report required information in a timely or accurate fashion could result in financial penalties, fines and other administrative actions. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our total enterprise value and stock price.\nAdditionally, the process of implementing a new ERP system is capital intensive and includes the inherent risk of incurring significant additional costs should the time and resource requirements of the implementation be greater than what the Company currently anticipates.\nMacroeconomic political and market conditions, and catastrophic events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf general macro-economic and business conditions in our key markets of North America, Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), the Middle East, Europe and Australia;\n\u25cf the lack of credit financing, or an increase in the cost of borrowing, for some of our potential customers due to increasing interest rates and lending requirements;\n\u25cf the overall demand for our products by the core market specialties of dermatologists and plastic surgeons;\n\u25cf the timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of the market for non-surgical aesthetic procedures, including consolidation among our competitors;\n\u25cf the level of awareness of aesthetic procedures and the market adoption of our products;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities;\n\u25cf general political developments, both domestic and in our foreign markets, including economic and political uncertainty caused by elections;\n\u25cf natural disasters;\n\u25cf tax law changes\n\u25cf currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf any trade restrictions or higher import taxes that may be imposed by foreign countries against products sold internationally by U.S. companies\nMacroeconomic developments, like global recessions and financial crises could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their budgets or be unable to fund product or upgrade application purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.\nIn addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, terrorist attacks around the globe and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.\nMacroeconomic declines, negative political developments, adverse market conditions and catastrophic events may cause a decline in our revenue, negatively affect our operating results, adversely affect our cash flow and could result in a decline in our stock price.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has decreased by approximately 60% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and may fluctuate substantially due to several factors, some of which are discussed below. Further, the Company has a relatively limited number of shares of common stock outstanding, a large portion of which is held by a small number of investors, which could result in the increase in volatility of its stock price.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has decreased by approximately 60% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 due in part to the deceleration in total revenue growth and profitability and other factors. As a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. The public market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated substantially and, due to the current concentration of stockholders, may continue to do so in the future.\nThe market price for our common stock could also be affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u25cf the general market conditions unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u25cf sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and our large institutional investors;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our, or our competitors\u2019, results of operations;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u25cf the announcement of new products, service enhancements, distributor relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf the announcement of the departure of a key employee or executive officer by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory developments or delays concerning our, or our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u25cf the initiation of any litigation by us or against us.\nActual or perceived instability and / or volatility in our stock price could reduce demand from potential buyers of our stock, thereby causing our stock price to either remain depressed or to decline further. In addition, if the market for medical-device company stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Any future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may fail to meet its publicly announced guidance or other expectations about its business and future operating results, which could cause its stock price to decline.\nThe Company started providing, and may continue to provide, financial guidance about its business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, the Company\u2019s management must make certain assumptions and judgments about its future operating performance, including but not limited to projected hiring of sales professionals, growth of revenue in the aesthetic device market, increase or decrease of its market share, costs of production of its recently introduced products, and stability of the macro-economic environment in our key markets. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. The Company\u2019s business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could adversely affect its operations and operating results. Furthermore, if the Company makes downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline.\nTo successfully market and sell our products internationally, the Company must address many issues that are unique to the Company's international business. Furthermore, international expansion is a key component of our growth strategy, although our international operations and foreign transactions expose us to additional operational challenges that the Company might not otherwise face.\nThe Company is focused on international expansion as a key component of our growth strategy and have identified specific areas of opportunity in various international markets. International revenue is a material component of our business strategy, and represented 37% of our total revenue in 2018 compared to 38% of our total revenue in 2017. The Company depends on third-party distributors and a direct sales force to sell its products internationally, and the Company may be unable to increase or maintain its level of international revenue.\nThe Company has experienced significant turnover of our international sales team in the past. For instance, the Company announced on February 9, 2018, that Miguel Pardos resigned his position as Executive Vice President, International Sales of Cutera, effective on February 28, 2018. Cutera reassigned Mr. Pardos\u2019 duties among existing members of the International team. Though the departure did not have an adverse effect on the Company's international sales, it added additional pressure on the existing members. While the Company continues to have a direct sales and service organization in Australia, Japan, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, a significant portion of its international revenue is generated through its network of distributors. Though the Company continues to evaluate and replace non-performing distributors, and has recently brought greater focus on collaborating with its distributor partners, there can be no assurance given that these initiatives will result in improved international revenue or profitability in the future.\nTo grow the Company\u2019s business, it will need to improve productivity in current sales territories and expand into new territories. However, direct sales productivity may not improve and distributors may not accept our business or commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If the Company is not able to increase or maintain international revenue growth, our total revenue, profitability and stock price may be adversely impacted.\nEconomic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIn 2018, 37% of our total revenue was from customers outside of North America. The Company expects its sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. The Company has placed a particular emphasis on increasing its growth and presence in international markets. The Company\u2019s international operations and sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include:\n\u25cf changes in trade protection measures, including embargoes, tariffs and other trade barriers, and import and export regulations and licensing requirements;\n\u25cf instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, such as economic nationalism, populism, protectionism and anti-global sentiment;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation, application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies;\n\u25cf unanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or in how such provisions are interpreted or administered;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property and contract rights abroad\n\u25cf possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, including those related to infrastructure and data transmission, security and privacy;\n\u25cf currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u25cf difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u25cf disruption of sales from labor and political disturbances;\n\u25cf regional safety and security considerations;\n\u25cf increased costs and risks in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing global sales operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;\n\u25cf lengthy payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf preference for locally-produced products, as well as protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies; and\n\u25cf outbreak or escalation of insurrection, armed conflict, terrorism or war\nChanges in the geopolitical or economic environments in the countries in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d), Chinese anti-corruption laws, U.K. Bribery Law, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If the Company fails to comply with any of these laws, the Company could suffer civil and criminal sanctions.\nAdditionally, the Company continues to monitor Brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the United Kingdom executes its exit from the EU. If the United Kingdom's membership in the EU terminates without an agreement (referred to as a \u201chard Brexit\u201d), there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and EU, increased transportation costs, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. The United Kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete and could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nIn addition to the general risks that the Company faces outside the U.S., our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us, including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, challenges collecting receivables, protection of our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products and services, higher business conduct risks, ability to hire and retain qualified talent and risks of political instability. The Company cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. In addition, although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, distributors or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our offerings and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results.\nTo successfully market and sell third party products internationally, the Company must address many issues that are unique to the related distribution arrangements which could reduce our available cash reserves and negatively impact our profitability.\nThe Company has entered into distribution arrangements pursuant to which the Company utilizes its sales force and distributors to sell products manufactured by other companies. In Japan, the Company has a non-exclusive right to distribute a Q-switched laser product manufactured by a third party OEM. The Company also has an exclusive agreement with ZO to distribute certain of their proprietary skincare products in Japan. Each of these agreements requires us to purchase annual minimum dollar amounts of their products. Additionally, the Company has entered into distribution arrangements with other companies to promote and sell the Secret RF and Juliet products.\nEach of these distribution agreements presents its own unique risks and challenges. For example, to sell skincare products the Company needs to invest in creating a sales structure that is experienced in the sale of such products and not in capital equipment. The Company needs to commit resources to train our sales force, obtain regulatory licenses, and develop new marketing materials to promote the sale of these products. In addition, the minimum commitments and other costs of distributing products manufactured by these companies may exceed the incremental revenue that the Company derives from the sale of their products, thereby negatively impacting our profitability and reducing our available cash reserves.\nIf the Company does not make the minimum purchases required in the distribution contracts, or if the third party manufacturer revokes our distribution rights, the Company could lose the distribution rights of the products, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenue, results of operations, cash flows and its stock price.\nThe Company offers credit terms to some qualified customers and also to leasing companies to finance the purchase of its products. In the event that any of these customers default on the amounts payable to us, its earnings may be adversely affected.\nThe Company generally offers credit terms of 30 to 90 days to qualified customers. In addition, from time to time, it offers certain key international distributors, with whom the Company has had an extended period of relationship and payment history, payment terms that are significantly longer than the regular 30 to 90 day terms. This allows such international distributor partners to have its products in stock and provide its products to customers on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2018, one international distributor partner accounted for 3.4% of our outstanding accounts receivable balance.\nWhile the Company believes it has an adequate basis to ensure that it collects its accounts receivable, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the financial position of customers to whom it has provided payment terms will not change adversely before the Company receives payment. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers to whom the Company has provided credit terms, the Company may recognize a bad debt charge in our general and administrative expenses. If this bad debt charge is material, it could negatively affect our future results of operations, cash flows and its stock price.\nAdditionally, in the event of deterioration of general business conditions or the availability of credit, the financial strength and stability of our customers and potential customers may deteriorate over time, which may cause them to cancel or delay their purchase of its products. In addition, the Company may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of its accounts receivables. The Company may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of funds or a reduction of funds collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debts.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively compete and generate additional revenue from new and existing products depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to distinguish the Company and its products from the competitors and their products, and to develop and effectively market new and existing products. The Company\u2019s success is dependent on many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf speed of new and innovative product development;\n\u25cf effective strategy and execution of new product launches;\n\u25cf identification and development of clinical support for new indications of our existing products;\n\u25cf product performance;\n\u25cf product pricing;\n\u25cf quality of customer support;\n\u25cf development of successful distribution channels, both domestically and internationally; and\n\u25cf intellectual property protection.\nTo compete effectively, the Company has to demonstrate that its new and existing products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments, by differentiating our products on the basis of such factors as innovation, performance, brand name, service, and price. This is difficult to do, especially in a crowded aesthetic market. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have newer or different products and more established customer relationships than the Company does, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. For example, the Company has encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, situations where, due to pre-existing relationships, potential customers decided to purchase additional products from our competitors. Potential customers also may need to recoup the cost of products that they have already purchased from our competitors and may decide not to purchase our products, or to delay such purchases. If the Company is unable to increase our market penetration or compete effectively, its revenue and profitability will be adversely impacted.\nThe Company competes against companies that offer alternative solutions to its products, or have greater resources, a larger installed base of customers and broader product offerings than ours. In addition, increased consolidation in the Company\u2019s industry may lead to increased competition. If the Company is not able to effectively compete with these companies, it may harm its business.\nThe medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technology development and product innovations. The Company\u2019s products compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as electrolysis, Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion and sclerotherapy. The Company\u2019s products also compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by public companies. Further, other companies could introduce new products that are in direct competition with our products. Competition with these companies could result in reduced selling prices, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently, there has been consolidation in the aesthetic industry leading to companies combining their resources, which increases competition and could result in increased downward pressure on our product prices. For example, Allergan acquired Zeltiq in April 2017, Hologic acquired Cynosure in March 2017, XIO Group acquired Lumenis in September 2015, and Valeant acquired Solta in January 2014. These consolidations have created newly-combined entities with greater financial resources, deeper sales channels and greater pricing flexibility than the Company. Rumored or actual consolidation of our partners and competitors could cause uncertainty and disruption to our business and can cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nThe energy-based aesthetic market faces competition from non-energy-based medical products, such as Botox and collagen injections. Other alternatives to the use of our products include electrolysis, a procedure involving the application of electric current to eliminate hair follicles, and chemical peels. The Company may also face competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other products that have not yet been developed.\nIf there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with the Company\u2019s products, practitioner demand for its products could be inhibited, resulting in unfavorable operating results and reduced growth potential.\nContinued expansion of the global market for laser and other-energy-based aesthetic procedures is a material assumption of our business strategy. Most procedures performed using our products are elective procedures not reimbursable through government or private health insurance, with the costs borne by the patient. The decision to utilize our products may therefore be influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf consumer disposable income and access to consumer credit, which as a result of an unstable economy, maybe significantly impacted;\n\u25cf the cost, safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments, including treatments which are not based upon laser or other energy-based technologies and treatments which use pharmaceutical products;\n\u25cf the success of the Company\u2019s sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf the education of the Company\u2019s customers and patients on the benefits and uses of the Company\u2019s products, compared to competitors\u2019 products and technologies.\nIf, as a result of these factors, there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, revenue and result of operations.\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state agencies or international regulatory bodies and our commercial operations would be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA for manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping.The FDA, state authorities and international regulatory bodies have broad enforcement powers. If the Company fails to comply with any U.S. law or any of the applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA, or federal or state agencies, or one of the international regulatory bodies, it could result in enforcement action by the agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf repair, replacement, refund, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\n\u25cf withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nFederal regulatory reforms and changes occurring at the FDA could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell its products profitably and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a device. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect the Company\u2019s business and our products. Changes in FDA regulations may lengthen the regulatory approval process for medical devices and require additional clinical data to support regulatory clearance for the sale and marketing of our new products. In addition, it may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market. Either of these changes lengthen the duration to market, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for its products.\nFor instance, on or about July 30, 2018, the FDA issued a public statement and sent letters to a number of companies in the medical aesthetics industry expressing concerns regarding \u201cvaginal revitalization\u201d procedures using energy-based devices. The Company\u2019s Juliet device is promoted and used by physicians in procedures that are the subject of the FDA\u2019s public warning. However, neither the Company nor its distribution partner were named in the announcement, and neither the Company nor its distribution partner have received a letter from the agency as of the date of this filing. Working with our distribution partner and the FDA, the Company is assessing the potential parameters of an additional study regarding our Juliet device to address the concerns highlighted in the FDA\u2019s statement. However, there can be no assurances that we will reach an agreement with our distribution partner on the execution details of such a study, or that such a study will be successful in addressing the FDA\u2019s safety concerns with our Juliet device.\nNotwithstanding, the Company saw a significant slowdown in the sales of Juliet in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. The Company believes this relates to the safety letter, given the timing. The Company supports any action that helps ensure patient safety going forward. The Company has a robust, multi-functional process that reviews its promotional claims and materials to ensure they are truthful, not misleading, fair and balanced, and supported by sound scientific evidence.\nIf the Company fails to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and laser performance standards, the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations could be halted, and its business would suffer.\nThe Company is currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (the \u201cQSR\u201d). The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record-keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products, as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products.\nThe FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. The Company has had multiple quality system audits by the FDA, our Notified Body, and other foreign regulatory agencies, with the most recent inspection by the FDA occurring in March, 2017. There were no significant findings or observations as a result of this audit. Failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or its failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of its products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraph, which would cause its sales and business to suffer.\nThe Company is a sponsor of Biomedical Research. As such, the Company is also subject to FDA regulations relating to the design and conduct of clinical trials. The Company are subject to unannounced BIMO audits, with the most recent inspection by FDA occurring over 5 days in August 2016. There were no significant findings and only two observations as a result of this audit. Our responses to these observations were accepted by the FDA. Failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse BIMO inspection or our failure to comply with Good Clinical Practices could result in us no longer being able to sponsor Biomedical Research, the reversal of 510(k) clearances previously granted based on the results of clinical trials conducted to gain clinical data to support those 510(k) clearances, or enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraph, which would cause our sales and business to suffer.\nIf the Company modifies one of its FDA-cleared devices, it may need to seek a new clearance, which, if not granted, would prevent the Company from selling its modified products or cause it to redesign its products.\nAny modifications to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The Company may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, its existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearance would adversely affect its ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm its revenue and future profitability.\nThe Company has made modifications to its devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that it believes do not or will not require additional clearance or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, the Company may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm the Company\u2019s operating results and require it to redesign its products.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory qualifications or approvals for its current or future products and indications, which could harm its business.\nSales of the Company\u2019s products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, exports of medical devices from the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required for obtaining clearance or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. The Company may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals in other countries. The Company may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or qualifications. If the Company experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market its products outside the U.S., or if the Company fails to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, the Company may be unable to market its products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth strategy.\nAny defects in the design, material or workmanship of its products may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers, which could materially increase its expenses, adversely impact profitability and harm its business.\nThe design of the Company\u2019s products is complex. To manufacture them successfully, the Company must procure quality components and employ individuals with a significant degree of technical expertise. If the Company\u2019s designs are defective, or the material components used in its products are subject to wearing out, or if suppliers fail to deliver components to specification, or if its employees fail to properly assemble, test and package its products, the reliability and performance of its products will be adversely impacted.\nIf the Company\u2019s products contain defects that cannot be repaired easily, inexpensively, or on a timely basis, the Company may experience:\n\u25cf damage to our brand reputation;\n\u25cf loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment;\n\u25cf increased costs due to product repair or replacement;\n\u25cf inability to attract new customers;\n\u25cf diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department; and\n\u25cf legal action.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could materially increase expenses, adversely impact profitability and harm our business.\nProduct liability suits could be brought against the Company due to a defective design, material or workmanship or misuse of its products and could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and an increase in its insurance rates.\nIf the Company\u2019s products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, the Company may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Misusing our products or failing to adhere to operating guidelines could cause significant eye and skin damage, and underlying tissue damage. In addition, if its operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, the Company may be subject to liability. The Company has been involved, and may in the future be involved, in litigation related to the use of its products. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from its core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against the Company. The Company may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. The Company may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide the Company with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against the Company, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm its reputation in the industry and could reduce product sales. In addition, the Company historically experienced steep increases in its product liability insurance premiums as a percentage of revenue. If its premiums continue to rise, the Company may no longer be able to afford adequate insurance coverage.\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results, divert management\u2019s attention from our business, and subject the Company to significant liabilities.\nAs described under \u201cNote 11- Commitments and Contingencies - Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is involved in various litigation, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and may require us to devote significant resources to our defense of these claims.\nSuch litigation involves certain non-compete provisions of an agreement an employee of ours was a party to while employed by a competitor. The competitor alleges causes of action for breach of contract (against the employee) and intentional interference with contractual relations (Cutera). The Company believes the non-compete provisions are unenforceable. The competitor has also threatened to file a complaint against another current employee based in Arizona. As of March 14, 2019, the Company is involved in several lawsuits worldwide, with most of the claims in various federal or state courts throughout the U.S. The complaints generally seek damages and other relief based on theories of breach of express and implied warranties, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer protection statutes.\nAlthough the Company is defending these matters vigorously, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation or proceeding. Litigation may have a material adverse effect on the Company because of potential adverse outcomes, defense costs, the diversion of our management's resources, availability of insurance coverage and other factors.\nIf customers are not trained and/or our products are used by non-physicians, it could result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation, result in product liability litigation, distract management and result in additional costs, all of which could harm our business.\nBecause the Company does not require training for users of its products, and sell its products at times to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products, which could harm our reputation and our business. U.S. federal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of \u201clicensed practitioners.\u201d The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training, and in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the U.S., many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of its products. The Company does not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor does the Company require that direct medical supervision occur-that is determined by state law. The Company and its distributors generally offer but do not require product training to the purchasers or operators of our products. In addition, the Company sometimes sells its systems to companies that rent its systems to third parties and that provide a technician to perform the procedures. The lack of training and the purchase and use of its products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and its business, and, in the event these result in product liability litigation, distract management and subject us to liability, including legal expenses.\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of the Company\u2019s marketable investments or impair the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nThe primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal. To achieve this objective, the Company invests its excess cash primarily in money market funds and in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and U.S. municipalities, in commercial paper and high grade corporate debt. As of December 31, 2018, our balance in marketable investments was $9.5 million. The longer the duration of a security, the more susceptible it is to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. For example, assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, there would not have any adverse impact the Company\u2019s earnings. As a result, changes in the market interest rates will affect its future net income (loss).\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making its vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm its business.\nMany of the components and materials that comprise its products is currently manufactured by a limited number of suppliers. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers\u2019 capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. The Company\u2019s reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm its business, including:\n\u25cf interruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s variation in a component;\n\u25cf lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u25cf inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or on reasonable terms;\n\u25cf inability to redesign one or more components in our systems in the event that a supplier discontinues manufacturing such components and the Company is unable to source it from other suppliers on reasonable terms;\n\u25cf difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications; and\n\u25cf delay in supplier deliveries.\nAny interruption in the supply of components or materials, or the Company\u2019s inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair its ability to meet the demand of the Company\u2019s customers, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks related to the reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply may adversely affect the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations and related product sales.\nThe Company maintains manufacturing operations at its facility in Brisbane, California, and purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Any problem affecting a supplier (whether due to external or internal causes) could have a negative impact on us.\nIn a few limited cases, specific components and raw materials are purchased from primary or main suppliers (or in some cases, a single supplier) for reasons related to quality assurance, cost-effectiveness ratio and availability. While the Company works closely with its suppliers to ensure supply continuity, the Company cannot guarantee that its efforts will always be successful. Moreover, due to strict standards and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing its products, it may not be able to quickly locate new supply sources in response to a supply reduction or interruption, with negative effects on its ability to manufacture its products effectively and in a timely fashion.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing is currently conducted at a single site, and the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar event could cause damage to its facilities and equipment, which might require the Company to cease or curtail operations.\nThe Company is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters, including fires, earthquakes, terrorist acts, floods, power losses, communications failures and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, the Company may not be able to operate our business at our facility in Brisbane, California. Our manufacturing facilities require FDA approval, which could result in significant delays before the Company could manufacture products from a replacement facility. The insurance the Company maintains may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions. Therefore, any such catastrophe could seriously harm our business and consolidated results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for some or all of our products, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nThe Company relies on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. At December 31, 2018, the Company had 32 issued U.S. patents and 5 pending U.S. patent applications. Some of our components, such as our laser module, electronic control system and high-voltage electronics, are not, and in the future may not be, protected by patents. Additionally, the Company\u2019s patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents the Company obtains may be challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties. Consequently, competitors could market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours. The Company may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and the Company does not know whether the steps it has taken to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property will be effective. Moreover, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nThe absence of complete intellectual property protection exposes us to a greater risk of direct competition. Competitors could purchase one of the Company\u2019s products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages the Company derives from our development efforts, design around our protected technology, or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights. If the Company\u2019s intellectual property is not adequately protected against competitors\u2019 products and methods, the Company\u2019s competitive position and its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact its future business and financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors or other patent holders may assert that the Company\u2019s present or future products and the methods the Company employs are covered by their patents. In addition, the Company does not know whether its competitors own or will obtain patents that they may claim prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell or import our products. Although the Company may seek to resolve any potential future claims or actions, it may not be able to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. If, following a successful third-party action for infringement, the Company cannot obtain a license or redesign our products, it may have to stop manufacturing and selling the applicable products and our business would suffer as a result. In addition, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may become involved in litigation not only as a result of alleged infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights but also to protect our own intellectual property. For example, the Company has been involved in litigation to protect the trademark rights associated with its company name or the names of its products. Infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate, and could divert management\u2019s attention from its core business.\nThe expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for the Company\u2019s customers could adversely affect its ability to sell its products, and therefore adversely affect its financial condition.\nSome of the Company\u2019s customers and prospective customers have had difficulty procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operation and use of its products. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, the Company\u2019s customers may discontinue using our products and potential customers may opt against purchasing laser-based products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage. The unavailability of insurance coverage for our customers and prospects could adversely affect its ability to sell its products, and that could harm its financial condition.\nFrom time to time the Company may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings, and as a result the Company may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that may negatively impact its operating results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions where it operates through a subsidiary, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. The Company\u2019s determination of its tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities.\nThe Company is currently under tax examination in Germany (\u201cCutera GmbH\u201d) for tax years ended December 31, 2011 through 2013 and are uncertain of the potential outcome of this examination. The Company underwent audits for our California sales and use tax returns for the period July 2013 through June 2016, and Canadian goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax returns for the period January 2013 to July 2015. Although these audits resulted in immaterial adjustments, the final timing and resolution of any future tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions. An increase or decrease of tax related to tax examination resolution could result in a change in the Company\u2019s income tax accrual and could negatively impact its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws, importation taxes and other changes that may be imposed by the current administration.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:\n\u25cf the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u25cf the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities\n\u25cf changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u25cf changes in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u25cf changes in share-based compensation; and\n\u25cf changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nIn the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), for example, has the potential to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. Due to subsequent legislative amendments the excise tax has been suspended for the period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020, which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flows.\nAny acquisitions that the Company makes could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWhile the Company from time to time evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipates continuing to make these evaluations, the Company has no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or collaborative projects. The Company may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate any businesses, products or technologies that the Company acquire.\nThe Company has limited experience as a team with acquiring companies and products. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and it may incur significant legal, accounting and banking fees in connection with such a transaction. Acquisitions could diminish our available cash balances for other uses, result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, and restructuring charges. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of its acquisitions or investments may not materialize and could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets.\nThe Company failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business and our financial condition or results.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with rules relating to bribery, foreign corrupt practices, and privacy and security laws may subject the Company to penalties and adversely impact its reputation and business operations.\nThe Company business is subject to regulation and oversight worldwide including:\n\u25cf the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity;\n\u25cf the UK Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors; and bribery provisions contained in the German Criminal Code, which, pursuant to draft legislation being prepared by the German government, may make the corruption and corruptibility of physicians in private practice and other healthcare professionals a criminal offense;\n\u25cf Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act , which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above laws, such as state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of the Company\u2019s business activities, including our relationships with practitioners and thought leaders worldwide, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or use our devices, as well as the Company\u2019s sales agents and distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The Company is also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, independent sales agents and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While the Company has policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions the Company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting the Company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nThere are similar laws and regulations applicable to us outside the U.S., all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the UK Bribery Act, the Brazil Clean Companies Act, and continued enforcement in the Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. The Company\u2019s operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of its employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors because these parties are not always subject to its control. It is the Company\u2019s policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices; however, its existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and its employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which the Company might be held responsible. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and could negatively affect its business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.\nWhile the Company believes it has a strong culture of compliance and adequate systems of control, and it seeks continuously to improve its systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses identified, there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of its employees, consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, the Company may be subject to penalties and material adverse consequences on its business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90081, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CUTR"}
