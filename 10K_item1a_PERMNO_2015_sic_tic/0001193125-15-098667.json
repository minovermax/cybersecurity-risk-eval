{"cik": "1374128", "company": "ENTELLUS MEDICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in 2006. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.9 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $103.7 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred securities, certain debt-related financing arrangements and from sales of our products and most recently with the completion of our IPO. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our products, sales and marketing activities and clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain clearances or approvals for our products. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from our existing products or from any of our products in development, to transition to profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows, is uncertain. We also expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to build our commercial infrastructure, develop, enhance and commercialize new products and incur additional operational costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. Furthermore, even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives.\nOur revenue is primarily generated from our XprESS family of multi-sinus products and we are therefore highly dependent on a limited number of products.\nWe began selling our XprESS family of products in 2010, and these products accounted for 95% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect that sales of these products will continue to account for the substantial majority of our revenue going forward. Therefore, our ability to execute our growth strategy and become profitable will depend not only upon a continued shift of more sinus procedures from traditional operating room settings to the ENT physician office setting, but also to the adoption of our XprESS family of products to perform those procedures. Some ENT physicians may have prior history with or preference for a competitor\u2019s balloon sinus dilation products or be reluctant to alter practice patterns and undergo training required to use our products. If our XprESS products fail to achieve wide market acceptance for any reason, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf physicians or patients are not willing to change current practices and continue to adopt office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures, our products may fail to gain increased market acceptance, and our business will suffer.\nOur primary strategy to grow revenues is to drive an increase in office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures and the adoption of our XprESS family of products to perform these procedures. While the number of ENT physicians performing sinus procedures using office-based balloon sinus dilation has increased in recent years, there is a significant group of ENT physicians who have not yet adopted these procedures, and additional ENT physicians may not adopt office-based balloon sinus dilation for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nlack of significant experience with balloon sinus dilation as a treatment alternative;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of adequate insurance coverage or reimbursement for office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures;\n\u2022\nperceived inadequacy of evidence supporting clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness of office-based balloon sinus dilation over existing alternatives;\n\u2022\na perception among some ENT physicians of patients\u2019 inability to tolerate balloon sinus dilation procedures in the physician office setting; and\n\u2022\nliability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures.\nIf additional ENT physicians do not continue to adopt, or existing ENT physicians cease using office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures for any reason, including those listed above, our ability to execute our growth strategy would be impaired, and our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe believe recommendations and support of our products by notable ENT physicians can influence market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from these influential ENT physicians, our ability to achieve broad market acceptance for our products may be impaired.\nIn addition, if patient receptivity toward treatment in an ENT physician office setting becomes less favorable in the future, this shift could negatively impact market acceptance of our products. Any negative change due to patient receptivity could also be compounded by patients reporting to physicians or other patients through word-of-mouth or social media.\nAdditionally, while it is currently more cost-effective to the healthcare system for providers to perform balloon sinus dilation in an ENT physician\u2019s office than a FESS procedure in the operating room, healthcare economics are always subject to change. If the use of our balloon sinus dilation products were to cease being more cost-effective than FESS due to changes in reimbursement economics, our products may fail to gain market acceptance, our future growth would be limited and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if payment rates for office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures were to be lowered, in particular by Medicare, which we believe would likely cause other third-party payors to implement comparable reductions to their reimbursement rates, ENT physicians may reduce the frequency of balloon sinus dilation procedures and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for the procedures using our products, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nHospital, physician and other healthcare provider customers, including ambulatory surgery center, or ASC, customers that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles or co-payments. In the hospital and ASC settings, our products are often used in a hybrid procedure in conjunction with traditional FESS. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for supplies used in surgical procedures, and with respect to FESS, no separate reimbursement for balloon sinus dilation, the additional cost associated with the use of our products in these settings can impact the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the hybrid procedure is performed. Some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt our products in light of the additional associated cost. Further, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for balloon sinus dilation procedures in either the office or facility setting could make it difficult for existing customers to continue using or to adopt our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will materially adversely affect our business.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform\npolicy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage or alter pre-authorization requirements for new or existing products and procedures. Additionally, some third-party payors do not currently cover or reimburse balloon sinus dilation procedures because they have determined insufficient evidence of favorable clinical outcomes is available. We are actively working to avoid or to reverse these non-coverage decisions, as applicable, but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are not successful in reversing existing noncoverage policies, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse balloon sinus dilation procedures reverse or limit their coverage in the future, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional preauthorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products or any of our products in development for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe compete and may compete in the future against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving increased market penetration or improved operating results.\nOur industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We believe competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat sinusitis. We currently compete against companies providing alternative treatments to balloon sinus dilation, as well as companies that provide competing balloon sinus dilation products. For example, we are aware that the Xomed division of Medtronic has recently launched a balloon sinus dilation device that competes with our XprESS family of products. Additionally, Intersect ENT is currently developing products for office-based treatment of sinusitis, which if approved may be competitive with us in the future. Many of the companies developing or marketing these ENT products are publicly traded or are divisions of publicly traded companies, including the Xomed division of Medtronic, the Acclarent division of Johnson & Johnson and the ArthroCare division of Smith & Nephew, each of which produces competing balloon sinus dilation products, and the Gyrus ACMI division of Olympus, Stryker Corporation and Intersect ENT, each of which produces tools and devices for FESS. These companies may enjoy several competitive advantages, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human capital resources;\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\ncontrol of key intellectual property, which could impact future products under development;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with ENT physicians, suppliers, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022\nmore established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.\nTo a lesser extent, we also have faced and may in the future face competition from pharmaceutical companies that develop medical therapies to treat sinusitis.\nIn addition, substantially all of our products are designed to be used exclusively during balloon sinus dilation or FESS procedures. If another company successfully develops an approach for the treatment of chronic\nsinusitis that would not benefit from the use of our products, or if another company develops a balloon sinus dilation device that is more efficacious, more cost-effective or easier to use than our products, sales of our products could be significantly and adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our license agreement with Acclarent, which exposes us to a variety of risks.\nWe are a party to a license agreement, or the Acclarent License, with Acclarent. Under the Acclarent License, Acclarent has granted us a non-exclusive license under patents held by Acclarent to manufacture, use and commercialize our currently marketed XprESS, PathAssist and FinESS products and certain future versions of those products, or, collectively, the Covered Products. We have certain obligations under the Acclarent License, including paying Acclarent a royalty on the sale of Covered Products. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Acclarent License, Acclarent may terminate the Acclarent License, in which case our current products would no longer enjoy a license under Acclarent\u2019s patents. Without the license, Acclarent might successfully enforce its patents against us based on the sale of our current products, possibly resulting in our being ordered to pay Acclarent monetary damages and/or in our being enjoined from selling our current products within any country where Acclarent has a valid and enforceable claim covering a given product. Furthermore, because the Acclarent License is non-exclusive, Acclarent could choose to also license the same intellectual property to other third-party competitors. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we do not control the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the Acclarent License. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If Acclarent fails to maintain the patents it has licensed to us under the Acclarent License, or loses its rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, which could severely harm our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to develop and commercialize additional ENT products.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and technological advancements. Therefore, it is important to our business that we continue to enhance our product offerings and introduce new products. Developing products is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our core balloon sinus dilation business. Even if we are successful in developing additional products, the success of any new product offering or enhancements to existing products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate ENT physician and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nbe fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products; and\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing new products, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired.\nOur future growth depends on physician awareness and adoption of our balloon sinus dilation devices.\nWe focus our sales, marketing and training efforts on ENT physicians. However, the initial point of contact for many patients suffering from chronic sinusitis may be primary care physicians or other referring medical professionals, such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants, who commonly see patients with sinus infections and sinusitis and prescribe pharmaceuticals to address sinusitis symptoms. We believe that education of primary care physicians and other medical professionals about the clinical merits and patient benefits of office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures is an important element of the growth of office-based balloon sinus dilation procedures. If we fail to educate primary care physicians and other medical professionals, they may not refer sinusitis patients to an ENT physician to perform balloon sinus dilation procedures and, as a result, those patients may continue to receive only medical management. If this were to occur, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired.\nThe efficacy of our products have been demonstrated in clinical studies sponsored by us, and insurance companies who do not cover stand-alone balloon sinus dilation may require additional or independently performed clinical studies prior to adopting or covering or maintaining coverage of procedures in which our products are used as a stand-alone therapy.\nOur success depends on the medical and third-party payor community\u2019s acceptance of our products as tools that are useful to ENT physicians treating patients with chronic sinusitis. We have sponsored seven clinical studies with over 600 patients to track outcomes of treatment with our products. While the results of these studies, collectively indicate that our products can be used to successfully treat uncomplicated chronic sinusitis equally effectively as FESS while also providing better recovery outcomes, if physicians or insurers do not find our data compelling or wish to wait for additional or independently performed studies, they may choose not to use or provide coverage and reimbursement for our products. Currently, we estimate there are insurance plans, including a number of large third-party payors, covering approximately 84 million lives that have determined balloon sinus dilation to be investigational and therefore do not cover it at this time.\nIn addition, the long-term effects of balloon sinus dilation with our products beyond 24 months are not known. Certain ENT physicians, hospitals, ASCs and insurers may prefer to see longer-term efficacy data than we have produced. We cannot make any assurances that any data that we or others generate will be consistent with that observed in our existing clinical studies.\nIt is difficult to forecast future performance and our financial results may vary from forecasts and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur limited operating history and commercial experience make it difficult for us to predict future performance. A number of factors over which we have limited control, such as seasonal variations in revenue, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. In the first quarter, our results can be impacted by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures in which our products are used. In the second quarter, demand may be increased by the seasonal nature of allergies and the resultant onset of sinus-related symptoms. In the third quarter, we believe the number of elective surgeries and particularly FESS or balloon sinus dilation procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters as a result of summer vacations of ENT physicians and their patients. In the fourth quarter, demand typically increases with the onset of the cold and flu season and related symptoms, as well as the desire of patients to spend the remaining balances in their flexible-spending accounts or because of lower out-of-pocket costs to patients who have already met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans.\nOther factors that may cause fluctuation in our quarterly results include:\n\u2022\nENT physician adoption of our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated pricing pressure;\n\u2022\nthe hiring, retention and continued productivity of our sales representatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products in development or for our current products outside the United States;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;\n\u2022\ndelays in receipt of anticipated purchase orders;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or failure of, component and raw material deliveries by our suppliers; and\n\u2022\npositive or negative coverage in the media or clinical publications of our products or products of our competitors or our industry.\nIn the event our actual revenue and operating results do not meet our forecasts or the forecasts or estimates of the research analysts that cover us for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry or group purchasing organizations could lead to demands for price concessions, which may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payors. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create more requests for pricing concessions in the future. Additionally, group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts may continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals and ASCs. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nThe size of the market for balloon sinus dilation products has not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimate of the annual total addressable market for balloon sinus dilation products is based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including, without limitation, the number of annual patient visits to ENT and primary care physicians, internal estimates regarding the number of certain types of FESS procedures performed annually, and our estimate of the number of people currently under medical management who would benefit from and be amenable to a balloon sinus procedure. In addition, our internal estimates are based in large part on current patterns of patient selection by ENT physicians for balloon sinus dilation. While we believe these factors have historically provided and may continue to provide us with effective tools in estimating the total market for balloon sinus dilation procedures and our products, these estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our products may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of patients who would benefit from our products and the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to expand, manage and maintain our direct sales and marketing organizations we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue.\nWe began selling our first FDA-cleared product, FinESS, in April 2008. We subsequently began selling our XprESS devices and PathAssist tools in February 2010 and August 2011, respectively. As a result, we have limited experience marketing and selling our products. As of December 31, 2014, our direct sales organization, including marketing and reimbursement, consisted of 114 employees, having increased from 84 employees as of December 31, 2012. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. If our direct sales force fails to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales may suffer.\nIn order to generate future sales growth, we will need to expand the size and geographic scope of our direct sales organization. Accordingly, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales personnel with significant technical knowledge of sinus procedures and related products. Because the competition for their services is high, we cannot assure you we will be able to hire and retain additional personnel on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales personnel would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur past growth has provided, and our future growth may create, challenges to our organization. From December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2014, the number of our employees increased from 124 to 173. In the future, we expect to hire and train new personnel as we continue to grow and expand our operations. As a public company, we will need to support managerial, operational, financial and other resources. This growth may place significant strain on us. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls and systems and procedures. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, there may be an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain key executives and highly qualified personnel.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our key executives. Although we have entered into employment letter agreements with certain of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We expect that Brian Farley will transition from his role as Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman in the future. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could therefore have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nMany of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock, particularly after the expiration of the lock-up agreements described herein. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products are designed to affect, and any future products will be designed to affect, important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products or our products in development could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our balloon sinus dilation or other products cause, or merely appear to have caused, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ncosts of litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our existing or new products;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or, if cleared or approved, products in development;\n\u2022\ndamage to our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or withdrawals from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022\nloss of revenue.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, although we have product liability and clinical study liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe utilize third-party, single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products. Our ability to supply our products commercially and to develop any future products depends, in part, on our ability to obtain these components in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization\nand clinical testing. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the past, we cannot assure that they will in the future be able to meet our demand for their products, either because we do not have long-term agreements with those suppliers, our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers, or their ability to produce the components used in our products.\nWhile we believe replacement suppliers exist for all components and materials we obtain from single sources, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of these components or materials, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. Even if we are able to find a replacement supplier, the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single-source components and materials used in our products in the event of disruption, those inventories may not be sufficient.\nIf our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of materials on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality on a timely basis, the continued commercialization of our products, the supply of our products to customers and the development of any future products would be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of ENT physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of ENT physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer with those ENT physicians or patients and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate them in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and advances in technologies. Accordingly, although we have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment, we may in the future pursue the acquisition of, or joint ventures relating to, complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisitions or joint ventures, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain any key employees related thereto. Integrating any business, product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time-consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management. If we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business will suffer. In addition, any amortization or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could increase our expenses.\nThe implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause disruption to our business and operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, which we expect to be implemented during 2015. This system will integrate our operations, including supply-chain, order entry, manufacturing, inventory and financial reporting, among others. This project requires significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business, and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. If we fail to implement the system successfully or in the contemplated timeframe, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business, including our ability to report financial results accurately and timely, could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to incur significant additional costs as a result of being a public company, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe expect to incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements that are newly applicable to us as a public company, including rules and regulations of the SEC, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of The Nasdaq Global Market. We expect that these rules and regulations will significantly increase our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Accordingly, increases in costs incurred as a result of becoming a publicly traded company may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure of a key information technology system, process or site could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business. These systems impact, among other things, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, we accept payments for many of our sales through credit and debit card transactions, which are handled through a third-party payment processor. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to credit and debit card payments. As a result of these transactions, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our products or experience an increase in our costs and expenses. In addition, as part of the payment processing process, we transmit our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information to our third-party payment processor. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 credit or debit card information if the security of our third-party credit card payment processor is breached. We and our third-party credit card payment processor are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we or our third-party credit card payment processor fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, and there may be an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our facilities are damaged or become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop and manufacture our products and, as a result, there will be an adverse impact on our business until we are able to secure a new facility.\nWe do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our research and development, manufacturing and back office activity and maintain all our raw material and finished goods inventory in a single location in Plymouth, Minnesota. Our facility and equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with our limited inventory of reserve raw materials and finished product, may result in the inability to continue manufacturing our products during such periods and the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have no prior experience selling our products outside of the United States and Canada and do not know if we will be successful in achieving adoption of our products and revenue growth outside of the United States in a timely manner. If we commercialize any products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may establish a direct sales force outside of the United States or enter into agreements with third-parties to market our products outside the United States. We expect that we would be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ntraining of third-parties on our products and the procedures in which they are used;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\ninternational regulators and third-party payors may require additional clinical studies prior to approving or allowing reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and U.S. anti-money laundering regulations, as well as exposure of our foreign operations to liability under these regulatory regimes;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nThe FDA regulatory clearance process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals could prevent us from commercializing our products.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a new use of or a claim for a cleared product in the United States, we must obtain clearance from the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process, unless an exemption applies. In addition, we may be required to seek FDA clearance for any changes or modifications to our products that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a change in intended use. The 510(k) clearance processes can be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. In addition to the time required to conduct clinical trials, if necessary, it generally takes from three to six months from submission of an application to obtain 510(k) clearance; however, it may take longer and 510(k) clearance may never be obtained. Our ability to obtain additional regulatory clearances for new products and indications may be significantly delayed or may never be obtained. Moreover, any new product introduction or product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous FDA review process.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, regulatory clearances for any product enhancements or new products we develop would result in delayed or no realization of revenue from such product enhancements or new products and in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.\nIn addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance for a product. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain the clearances we have received or may receive in the future. In addition, our existing clearances can be revoked if any issues arise that bring into question our products\u2019 safety or effectiveness. Any failure to maintain compliance with FDA regulatory requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nThe products we currently market have been cleared by the FDA for specific treatments. We train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our products off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations.\nIn addition, physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Similarly, in an effort to decrease costs, physicians may also reuse those of our products that are intended for a single use or may purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us, which could result in product failure and liability. As described immediately above, product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nOur marketed products are subject to Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, obligations, which require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report under the MDR regulations is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event\nor if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearances, seizure of our products, or delay in clearance of future products.\nWe and any of our future contract manufacturers are subject to various governmental regulations related to the manufacturing of our products, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of, and be subject to material sanctions if we or our future contract manufacturers violate, these regulations.\nThe methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities, and both we and any future contract manufacturers we may employ are subject to such inspections. We cannot guarantee that we or any future third-party manufacturers will take the necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 manufacturing processes, including any failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nadministrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending or future clearances or approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nAny of these actions could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products and would likely harm our business.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in their design or manufacture. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation and business, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action.\nIf clinical studies of our future products do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or, with respect to our current or future products, elsewhere, we will be unable to expand the indications for or commercialize these products.\nWe will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support new indications for our products or for clearances of new product lines, or for the approval of the use of our products in some foreign countries. Clinical testing can take many years, can be expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use. Even if our future products are cleared in the United States, commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require approval by regulatory authorities in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our business.\nHealthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. In addition, new regulations and interpretations of existing healthcare statutes and regulations are frequently adopted.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. While the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022\nimposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions (described in more detail below), although the effective rate paid may be lower;\n\u2022\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\ncreates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to Congress to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nIn addition, third-party payors regularly update payments to physicians and hospitals where our products are used. For Medicare, annual updates to physician payments are made using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. Most recently, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, signed into law in April 2014, provided for a 0.5% increase from 2013 payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2014 and a 0% change from January 1 until April 1, 2015. If Congress fails to intervene to prevent the negative update factor in future years, the resulting decrease in payment could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Because there is no separate reimbursement for our products, and with respect to FESS, no separate reimbursement for balloon sinus dilation, these payment updates could directly impact the demand for our products or any products we may develop in the future, if cleared or approved.\nFurthermore, we believe that many individuals who have obtained insurance coverage through the health insurance exchanges which arose as a result of the Affordable Care Act have done so with policies that have significantly higher deductibles than policies they may have obtained prior to its enactment. Because the out-of-pocket costs of undergoing a procedure such as balloon sinus dilation for patients who have not met their deductible for a given year would be significantly higher than they historically would have been, these patients may be discouraged from undergoing such a procedure due to the cost. Any reluctance on the part of patients to undergo balloon sinus dilation procedures due to cost could impact our ability to expand sales of our products and could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to additional federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to our healthcare business; our failure to comply with those laws could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could adversely impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, on device manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period, and manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements, including the provision of stock options as partial compensation for consulting services, with physicians, some of whom use or purchase our products, and other customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could adversely impact our business.\nSales of our devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registration or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. In certain countries we intend to rely upon third-party\ndistributors to obtain all required regulatory registrations and approvals, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such registrations or approvals. Our distributors in these countries may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or registrations, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If these distributors experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our products outside the United States, or if they fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in certain international markets effectively, or at all.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur operations use or generate small volumes of hazardous or toxic materials. We are therefore subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with environmental, health and safety laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. We also expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, and may require us to change how we manufacture our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Relating to Capital Requirements and Finances\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our recent IPO, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenue will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least 24 months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of additional regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any product recall that may occur;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating as a public company.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third-parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third-parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and its research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which might be beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. For these reasons, in the event we experience a change of control, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property Matters\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection and third-parties from which we license intellectual property may not enforce their intellectual property rights, which may permit third-parties to compete against us more effectively.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies and inventions used in, or embodied by, our products. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions in our consulting and employment agreements. These legal means afford only limited protection, however, and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Furthermore, while we have no reason to believe that any third parties hold rights of ownership to the intellectual property we regard as our own, we cannot assure shareholders that third parties of which we are unaware do not possess such rights, or that we will not be subject to, and forced to defend against, third-party claims of ownership to our intellectual property in the future. In either case, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nPatents\nThe process of applying for patent protection itself is time-consuming and expensive and we cannot assure you that all of our patent applications will issue as patents or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. The rights granted to us under our patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage, and they could be opposed, contested, or circumvented by our competitors or declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed by third-parties. For example, we do not control the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the Acclarent License described above. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated. In addition, because the Acclarent License is non-exclusive, Acclarent could choose to also license the same intellectual property to other third-party competitors, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our technology and products. The rights granted to us under these patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors or declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. If any of our patents are challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third-parties, and if we do not own other enforceable patents protecting our products, competitors could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours, and our business will suffer. In addition, the patents we own may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement, and defense of our patents and applications. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third-parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nMoreover, the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist in the future, and the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products.\nTrademarks\nWe rely on our trademarks as one means to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Our trademark applications may not be approved, however. Third-parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nTrade Secrets and Know-How\nWe may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent and other intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to successfully market our products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by frequent and extensive intellectual property litigation and is highly competitive. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and/or the methods employed in our products are covered by their patents. If our products or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from manufacturing or marketing our products. In the event that we become involved in such a dispute, we may incur significant costs and expenses and may need to devote resources to resolving any claims, which would reduce the cash we have available for operations and may be distracting to management.\nWe do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, will apply for, or will obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export our products. Competing products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our products in one or more foreign countries. We may also initiate litigation against third-parties to protect our own intellectual property. Our intellectual property has not been tested in litigation. If we initiate litigation to protect our rights, we run the risk of having our patents invalidated, which would undermine our competitive position.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time-consuming, and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and could prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our products unless we can obtain licenses to use technology or ideas covered by such patents. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain these licenses, we could be forced to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon the product altogether. As a result, our ability to grow our business and compete in the market may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nWe could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products could have an adverse impact on our business, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. In recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe volume and timing of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments with respect to our or others\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nmedia exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in reimbursement;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf a trading market for our common stock develops, the trading market will be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. If any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take, and intend to take, advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d In particular, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (1) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) we will be exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements, (3) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (4) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or elect not to avail themselves of this provision.\nWe may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (2) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 6, 2015, our officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 5% of our common stock, collectively control approximately 68.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they were to act together, would be able to control the management and affairs of our Company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nIn the event that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of becoming a public company, we are required, under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. In preparing our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we determined that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed that related to our having recorded revenue relating to sales orders that had been falsified by one of our sales representatives. Subsequent to identifying this material weakness, we implemented processes and controls designed to enhance our internal controls over the customer sales order process and to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2014, we determined that we have remediated the material weakness. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur in the future and not be detected.\nIn addition, once we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances and that could accelerate our timeline for complying with Section 404(b).\nIf we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors, when required, are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, or be delayed in producing these financial reports, both of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We could also be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market and could be subject to securities litigation.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that:\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the exclusive right to expand the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nour board of directors may alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, our current credit facility precludes, and any future debt agreements may preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 15176, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ENTL"}
