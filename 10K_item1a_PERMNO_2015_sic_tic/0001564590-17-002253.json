RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to the Business of the Company\nThe highly competitive market for our products and industry fragmentation may continue to create adverse\nprice pressures.\nThe markets for the majority of our product categories are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors. Management believes that excess capacity in our markets, as well as increasing consolidation of our customer base has caused downward price pressure for our products and that this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which we compete may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices as a result of synergies achieved.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials may continue to adversely affect our businesses.\nElectronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of print materials. Consumers continue to accept electronic substitution in directory printing and are replacing traditional reading of print materials with online, hosted media content or e-reading devices. The extent to which consumers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future rates of acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has negatively impacted some of our products, such as directories and books. Digital technologies have also impacted printed magazines, as some advertising spending has started transitioning from print to electronic media. To the extent that consumers and customers continue to accept these alternatives, our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses, could adversely affect us, as the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate.\nGlobal economic conditions affect our customers\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. Because a significant part of our business relies on advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and consumer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for the printing and related services that we provide. Delays or reductions in customers\u2019 spending would have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could be material, and consequently could negatively impact our results of consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased net sales, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. Our exposure to industries experiencing financial difficulties and certain financially troubled customers could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. Further, a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or a sustained period of unfavorable economic conditions could increase our exposure to credit risks of our customers and result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. We may experience operating margin declines, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive price pressures, inventory write-downs, cost increases for wages and materials, and increases in pension plan funding requirements. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.\nFor instance, in June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last up to two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union-derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal or renegotiation of the terms of their membership. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nAdverse credit market conditions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing.\nWe may, from time to time, depend on access to the credit markets. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial markets institutions to fail or may cause lenders to hoard capital and reduce lending. The failure of a financial institution that supports the Company\u2019s existing credit agreement would reduce the size of its committed facility unless a replacement institution were added.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality, as print demand is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future. If we are unable to obtain access to financing sources to fund our working capital needs or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nFluctuations in the costs and availability of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials may adversely impact us.\nPurchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to customers through higher prices. In addition, we may not be able to resell waste paper and other print-related byproducts or may be adversely impacted by decreases in the prices for these by-products. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely impact customers\u2019 demand for our printing and related services to the extent we pass along the costs to our customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support our operations. Unforeseen developments in these markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials and could cause a decline in our net sales.\nWe rely on a key supplier for ink and if such supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain obligations under our arrangement with them, we may be unable to procure comparable supply from another supplier in a timely fashion, or when we are able to procure such supply, such supply may be on worse terms.\nA significant portion of our ink comes from a single supplier pursuant to a multi-year supply agreement. The ink industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, as the demand for ink has declined while the costs of raw materials used to manufacture ink have fluctuated. We rely on this ink supplier to meet a significant portion of our ink needs, and have negotiated a contract that provides us with favorable terms and certain contingencies from supply disruption. A disruption in the supply of ink from this supplier, either from natural disaster, financial bankruptcy or other supply interruption, may require us to purchase a significant amount of ink from other suppliers or assume the production ourselves, which in either case, may be on worse terms and slow our production, either of which could have a negative impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe have in the past acquired and intend in the future to acquire other businesses, and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the Company or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt the businesses of the Company or the acquired businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy is, in part, predicated on the Company\u2019s ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the Company\u2019s products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nWe may be subject to more intensive competition if our competitors pursue consolidations.\nWe currently have a large number of competitors in the markets in which we operate. We believe that selectively pursuing acquisitions is an important strategy for our business. If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another, and we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the competitive landscape we face could be significantly altered. Such consolidation could create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and the resulting increase in competitive pressures could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brands or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition, particularly in our Office Products segment, and reputation generally are important aspects of our business. Maintaining and further enhancing our brands and reputation will be important to retaining and attracting customers for our products. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation for products will continue to increase as competition in the market for our products continues to increase. Our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers and strategic partners, the quality and perceived value of our products, actions of our competitors, and positive or negative publicity. Our reputation also depends on the quality of our customer service, and if our customer service declines, our reputation may also decline. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on our business. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. Many of these manufacturers may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than we offer. In addition, many members of our management have significant industry experience that is valuable to our competitors. Our executive officers have non-solicitation agreements contractually prohibiting them from soliciting our customers and employees for a specified period of time after they leave the Company. If one or more members of our senior management team leave and cannot be replaced with a suitable candidate quickly, we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nCatastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events could cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our customers, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature could also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and from performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with operations outside the United States.\nNet sales from our operations in geographic regions outside the United States accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated and combined net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including the impact of economic and political instability of those countries in which we operate. Our operations outside of the United States are primarily in Poland and Mexico. Our business in Poland, which primarily serves the European market, has experienced a decline in profitability due to adverse economic conditions in Europe since the global financial crisis, which has affected the demand for print services in Europe. Security disruptions within the regions in Mexico in which we operate may interfere with operations, which could negatively impact our supply chain.\nWe are also subject to risks that could materially affect our operations and operating results with respect to potential changes in United States government trade policy and legislation, including changes to tax laws, withdrawal from or modification of certain international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d), the imposition of additional tariffs or other restrictions on trade on goods produced outside the United States for import into the United States and any changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which we operate or do business and compliance with applicable anti-corruption and sanctions laws and regulations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into our consolidated financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, net sales and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, we may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to our employees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. may also increase our cost of providing such benefits. The full effect that a full or partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act or changes to other healthcare laws and regulations would have on our business remains unclear at this time, and could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, or lower returns on assets may increase required pension plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with historically low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions may increase the level of expected required pension plan contributions in future years. Various conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate, or worsen, the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nA decline in our expected profitability or the expected profitability of our individual reporting units could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.\nWe hold goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write-down or write-off of these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in postal rates, regulations and delivery systems may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customers\u2019 cost structure and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces and types of mailings that our customers mail. On January 22, 2017, the USPS implemented a rate adjustment affecting all market dominant classes including an average inflation-based rate increase for each class of mail. Going forward, the frequency and percentage of postal rate increases are uncertain. As of the date hereof there are two efforts underway. First, on September 1, 2016, the Postal Regulatory Commission (the \u201cPRC\u201d) notified the public that, pursuant to its statutory mandate under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, it would begin reviewing the system for regulating rates and classes for market dominant products to determine if it is achieving the objectives established by Congress. If the PRC determines that the system is not achieving the objectives, the PRC may, by regulation, make modifications or adopt an alternative system as necessary to achieve the objectives. Second, on January 31, 2017, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives. If the bill is passed into law, it would allow the USPS to increase postal rates for market-dominant products by 2.15%, or 1 cent, for a First-Class stamp.\nThese two efforts leave our customers with an uncertain future relative to budgeting for postal expenses. If either of these efforts result in declines in print volumes mailed, this may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nThe conduct of our businesses is subject to various environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our results or increase our costs and liabilities.\nVarious laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels. Proposals under consideration include limitations on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted. The impacts of such proposals could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe competitiveness, success and growth of our business may depend on our ability to refurbish or replace our infrastructure, which could result in an increase in our capital expenditures and such capital expenditures could be substantial. We may be required to invest more in capital expenditures than we have done historically.\nCapital expenditures, such as software upgrades or machinery replacements, may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness, success and growth of our business. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is expected to remain competitive. We may be required to invest amounts in capital expenditures that exceeds our recent spending levels to replace worn out or obsolete machinery or otherwise remain competitive. If cash from operations is insufficient to provide for needed levels of capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain funds for such purposes elsewhere, we may be unable to make necessary upgrades or\nrepairs to our software and facilities. An increase in capital expenditures could affect our ability to compete effectively and could have a negative impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of customers or the failure to implement new required processes or procedures in connection with the expansion of our products and services into new areas may adversely impact our business.\nMany of the end markets in which our customers compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences. In order to remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of customers. If we are unable to continue to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments, changing demands of customers and the expansion of our products and services into new areas may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies, as well as the implementation of additional necessary or required compliance procedures and processes to which we are not currently subject. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers. Furthermore, our compliance with new procedures and processes may increase our costs and, in the event we are unable to comply, may reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to work with us. If we are unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, or if we cannot comply with these necessary or required procedures or processes, customers\u2019 demand for our products and services may be adversely affected.\nOur services depend on the reliability of computer systems maintained by us and our vendors and the ability to implement and maintain information technology and security measures to protect against security breaches and data leakage.\nWe depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems, or a security breach or a data leak that compromises the confidential and sensitive information stored in those systems, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors.\nOur systems allow us to share information that may be confidential in nature to our customers across our offices worldwide, which allows us to increase global reach for our customers. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage, power outages and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. Those systems are also susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency. Our systems are also susceptible to breaches due to intentional employee misconduct. For any of these reasons, we may experience systems malfunctions or interruptions or leakage of confidential information. A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of any one of our computer or data processing systems, or the leakage of confidential information due to a malfunction or breach of our systems or employee misconduct, could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently, and damage our reputation if we are unable to track transactions, deliver products and safeguard our customers\u2019 confidential information. A malfunction that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Recent Separation from RRD\nBecause there was not a public market for our common stock prior to the separation, the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the current market price of our stock after the separation.\nPrior to the separation, we did not have any securities traded on any exchange and, as a result, have a very limited trading history. There has been a limited market in our common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investors\u2019 interest will lead to a liquid trading market or whether the market price of our common stock will be volatile in the upcoming periods. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this annual report on Form 10-K or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative developments for our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions.\nShares of LSC\u2019s common stock are eligible for future sale, and substantial sales of such shares may cause the price of LSC\u2019s common stock to decline.\nAny sales of substantial amounts of LSC\u2019s common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of LSC\u2019s common stock to decline. As of October 1, 2016, LSC had approximately 32 million of its common stock outstanding (of which approximately 26 million were distributed and owned by the public). Such publicly-owned shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), unless the shares are owned by one of LSC\u2019s \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. LSC is unable to predict whether large amounts of its common stock will be sold in the open market and whether a sufficient number of buyers would be in the market at that time.\nIn connection with the separation, RRD retained 19.25% of LSC\u2019s total shares outstanding. RRD will dispose of such shares within the 12-month period following the separation. Such disposition could include one or more subsequent exchanges of LSC common stock for debt of RRD, or otherwise using the common stock to satisfy RRD\u2019s outstanding obligations. RRD and LSC entered into a Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement wherein LSC agreed, upon the request of RRD, to use reasonable best efforts to effect a registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of any shares of LSC\u2019s common stock retained by RRD. Refer to Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement, filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 10-K.\nDispositions of significant amounts of LSC\u2019s common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of LSC\u2019s common stock.\nThe spinoff from RRD could result in significant liability to LSC.\nThe spin-off is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to RRD and its stockholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Completion of the spin-off was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the RRD Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the spin-off was also conditioned upon RRD\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by RRD, LSC and Donnelley Financial. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or\nincomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the RRD transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.\nIf the separation is determined to be taxable, RRD and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement, LSC may be required to indemnify RRD for any liabilities incurred by RRD if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by LSC following the spinoff. For additional detail, refer to Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.4 to this Form 10-K.\nThe tax rules applicable to the separation may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation from RRD under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, for the two-year period following the separation, we are subject to restrictions with respect to:\n\u2022\ntaking any action that would result in our ceasing to be engaged in the active conduct of our business, with the result that we are not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of certain provisions of the Code;\n\u2022\nredeeming or otherwise repurchasing any of our outstanding stock, other than through certain stock purchases of widely held stock on the open market;\n\u2022\namending our Certificate of Incorporation (or other organizational documents) that would affect the relative voting rights of separate classes of our capital stock or would convert one class of our capital stock into another class of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nliquidating or partially liquidating;\n\u2022\nmerging with any other corporation (other than in a transaction that does not affect the relative shareholding of our shareholders), selling or otherwise disposing of (other than in the ordinary course of business) our assets, or taking any other action or actions if such merger, sale, other disposition or other action or actions in the aggregate would have the effect that one or more persons acquire (or have the right to acquire), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, assets representing one-half or more our asset value;\n\u2022\ntaking any other action or actions that in the aggregate would have the effect that one or more persons acquire (or have the right to acquire), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, capital stock of ours possessing (i) at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or equity interests of ours entitled to vote, or (ii) at least 50% of the total value of shares of all classes of stock or of the total value of all equity interests of ours, other than an acquisition of our shares as part of the separation solely by reason of holding RRD common stock (but not including such an acquisition if such RRD common stock, before such acquisition, was itself acquired as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares of our stock meeting the voting and value threshold tests listed previously in this bullet); and\n\u2022\ntaking any action that (or failing to take any action the omission of which) would be inconsistent with the separation qualifying as, or that would preclude the separation from qualifying as, a transaction that is generally tax-free to RRD and the holders of RRD common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability during such period to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business. These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets. For more information, refer to Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.4 to this Form 10-K.\nLSC's historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe historical information about LSC prior to October 1, 2016 included in this annual report on Form 10-K refers to LSC\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with RRD. LSC\u2019s historical financial information for such periods was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of RRD. Accordingly, such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows that LSC would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that LSC will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, LSC\u2019s business was operated by RRD as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. RRD or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for LSC, such as tax, treasury, finance, audit, risk management, legal, information technology, human resources, stockholder relations, compliance, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and compensation. After the separation, RRD has continued to provide some of these functions to LSC, as described in Transition Services Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.2 to this Form 10-K. LSC\u2019s historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from RRD for such functions. These allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses LSC would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company in the periods presented. LSC will make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which LSC no longer has access as a result of the separation. These initiatives to develop LSC\u2019s independent ability to operate without access to RRD\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure have been costly and will continue to be costly to implement in the future. LSC may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline.\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, LSC\u2019s business was integrated with the other businesses of RRD. LSC was able to utilize RRD\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although LSC has entered into transition agreements with RRD, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits LSC enjoyed as a result of being integrated with RRD and may result in LSC paying higher charges than in the past for these services. As a separate, independent company, LSC may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation, which could decrease LSC\u2019s overall profitability. As a separate, independent company, LSC may also not be as successful in negotiating favorable tax treatments and credits with governmental entities. This could have a material adverse effect on LSC\u2019s consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows for periods after the separation.\n\u2022\nGenerally, prior to the separation, LSC\u2019s working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, R&D and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of RRD. As a separate independent company, LSC may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for LSC\u2019s business is higher than RRD\u2019s cost of capital prior to the separation.\nOther significant changes have occurred and may continue to occur in LSC\u2019s cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from RRD. For additional information about the past financial performance of LSC\u2019s business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements of LSC\u2019s business, refer to the discussion in Item 7, Item 8 and the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred, and we may continue to incur, material costs and expenses as a result of our separation from RRD.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, costs and expenses greater than those we currently incur as a result of our separation from RRD. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting and costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). In addition, we expect to either maintain similar or have increased corporate and administrative costs and expenses to those we incurred or were allocated while part of RRD, even though, after the separation, LSC is a smaller, stand-alone company. We cannot assure you that these costs will not be material to our business.\nAs LSC builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, LSC has incurred and will continue to incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.\nLSC expects to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. LSC may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from RRD's existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions as LSC replaces these systems. LSC may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data, and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. LSC's failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces RRD's information technology services, or its failure to implement the new systems and replace RRD's services successfully, could disrupt its business, adversely affect its ability to collect receivables from customers, and have a material adverse effect on its profitability. In addition, if LSC is unable to replicate or transition certain systems, its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, beginning in Fiscal Year 2017, we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the separation.\nWe believe that our separation from RRD has allowed, and will continue to allow, among other benefits, us to focus on our distinct strategic priorities; afford us direct access to the capital markets and facilitate our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock; facilitate incentive compensation arrangements for our employees more directly tied to the performance of our business; and enable us to concentrate our financial resources solely on our own operations. However, we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits. For example, in order to prepare ourselves for the separation, we undertook a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we currently expect, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses after the separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key customer and supplier relationships. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRRD or Donnelley Financial may not satisfy their respective obligations under the Transition Services Agreements and other agreements that were entered into as part of the separation, or we may not have necessary systems and services in place when the transition services terms expire.\nIn connection with the separation, we entered into Transition Services Agreements with both RRD and Donnelley Financial. Refer to exhibits 2.2 and 2.3 to this annual report on Form 10-K, related to the agreements with RRD and Donnelley Financial, respectively. These Transition Services Agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. We will rely on RRD and Donnelley Financial to satisfy their respective performance and payment obligations under these Transition Services Agreements. If RRD or Donnelley Financial is unable to satisfy its respective obligations, including indemnification obligations, under these Transition Services Agreements, we could incur operational difficulties. The other agreements relating to the separation provide for indemnification in certain circumstances and commercial agreements establish ongoing commercial arrangements. There can be no guarantee that RRD or Donnelley Financial, as the case may be, will satisfy any obligations owed to us under such agreements, including any indemnification obligations.\nFurther, if we do not have our own systems and services in place, or if we do not have agreements in place with other providers of these services when the term of a particular transition service terminates, we may not be able to operate our business effectively, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services RRD and Donnelley Financial will provide. We may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from RRD\u2019s or Donnelley Financial\u2019s systems to our systems, as the case may be, which could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services RRD and Donnelley Financial are providing during the transition period.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the separation and the degree to which we are currently leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe incurred approximately $825 million of debt in connection with the separation. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the separation, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including facility closure, staff reductions, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and restricting future capital return to stockholders. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the print and related services industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt.\nIn addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nThe agreements and instruments that govern our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement that governs our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants can have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Agreement that governs our Senior Secured Credit Facilities requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Term Loan Facility and indenture. If we violate covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indenture and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indenture would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt.\nIf our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt.\nDespite our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although our the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities restrict the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had $388 million available for additional borrowing under our Revolving Facility. The more indebtedness we incur, the further exposed we become to the risks associated with substantial leverage described above.\nRRD and Donnelley Financial have a significant understanding of our business and may be uniquely positioned to compete against us.\nPrior to the separation, we operated as part of RRD, and many of its and Donnelley Financial\u2019s current officers, directors and employees have participated in the development and execution of our corporate strategy and the management of our day-to-day operations. RRD and Donnelley Financial have significant knowledge of our products, operations, strengths, weaknesses and strategies. This knowledge includes the cost of production, average market pricing and margin, compensation of critical employees, key or critical accounts knowledge, intellectual property and proprietary processes. Because of RRD\u2019s competitive insight into our operations and Donnelley Financial\u2019s ability to compete in discrete areas of our business, specifically the printing of books, competition from RRD, and to a lesser extent Donnelley Financial, which could occur in the future, may negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nSubstantial sales of our common stock may occur, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nRRD stockholders who received shares of common stock in LSC after the separation generally may sell those shares in the public market. RRD retained 19.25% of our common stock, and may sell or transfer its shares in certain circumstances. It is possible that some RRD stockholders, including some of our larger stockholders, will sell our common stock if, for reasons such as our business profile, market capitalization as an independent company or the size or rate of return of our dividend, we do not fit their investment objectives, or-in the case of index funds-we are not a participant in the index in which they are investing. The sales of significant amounts of our common stock relating to the above events or the perception in the market that such sales will occur may decrease the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends to LSC stockholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, future prospects, earnings, capital requirements and debt service obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our debt or debt that we may incur in the future may continue to limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. While our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share on October 27, 2016 payable on December 1, 2016 and on January 18, 2017 payable on March 2, 2017, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend.\nDelaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could make it more difficult to acquire us and limit your ability to sell your shares at a premium.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series with such rights, obligations and preferences as the board of directors may determine, without further vote or action by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe initial classification of our board of directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders until the second annual meeting of stockholders after the separation;\n\u2022\nadvanced notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors and for stockholders to submit proposals for consideration at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ninability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting rights for our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. This statute, as well as the provisions in our organizational documents, could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing certain potential acquisitions or a change in control of us.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC may be diluted in the future.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC may be diluted in the future because of equity securities we issue, either as consideration for acquisitions, in connection with capital raises or for equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and employees. We may issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition. Further, to the extent that LSC raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Any such transaction will dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership in LSC.", "PERMNO": 16278, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "LKSDQ"}
