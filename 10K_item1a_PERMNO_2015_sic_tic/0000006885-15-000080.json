{"cik": "6885", "company": "STAGE STORES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Act\") provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. We wish to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Act.\nCertain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act, and such statements are intended to qualify for the protection of the safe harbor provided by the Act. The words \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"objective,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"may,\" \"target,\" \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, strategies, plans, goals or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to the expectations of management as to future occurrences and trends, including statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events and projected sales, earnings, capital expenditures and business strategy.\nForward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and factors concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that are made herein and in other reports and releases are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ability for us to maintain normal trade terms with vendors, the ability for us to comply with the various covenant requirements contained in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement (as defined in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"), the demand for apparel, and other factors. The demand for apparel and sales volume can be affected by significant changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn, employment levels in our markets, consumer confidence, energy and gasoline prices and other factors influencing discretionary consumer spending. Other factors affecting the demand for apparel and sales volume include unusual weather patterns, an increase in the level of competition in our market areas, competitors' marketing strategies, changes in fashion trends, changes in the average cost of merchandise purchased for resale, availability of product on normal payment terms and the failure to achieve the expected results of our merchandising and marketing plans as well as our store opening or relocation plans. Additional assumptions, factors and risks concerning future conditions are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and may be discussed from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control.\nForward-looking statements are and will be based upon management\u2019s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Although management believes the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge, forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, any one or a combination of which may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nReaders should carefully review this Form 10-K in its entirety, including, but not limited to our financial statements and the accompanying notes, and the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 1A. Readers should consider these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are made as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our public announcements and SEC filings.\nOur ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward-looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Described below are certain risk factors that management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. There may also be additional risks that are presently immaterial or unknown.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our strategies, our operating performance may be significantly impacted. There is a risk that we will be unable to meet or exceed our operating performance targets and goals in the future if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful. Our ability to develop and execute our strategic plan and to execute the business activities associated with our strategic and operating plans, may impact our ability to meet our operating performance targets.\nOur failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences in a timely manner may adversely affect our operations. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner. We attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyles and consumer preferences affecting our merchandise. However, any sustained failure on our part to identify and respond to such trends may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to successfully operate our e-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations may adversely impact our business and sales. Our e-commerce platform provides another channel to generate sales. We believe that the e-commerce website will drive incremental sales by providing existing customers another opportunity to shop with us and also allowing us to reach new customers. If we do not successfully meet the challenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling customer expectations, our business and sales may be adversely affected.\nWe face the risk of significant competition in the retail apparel industry which may result in the loss of customers and adversely affect revenues. The retail apparel business is highly competitive. Although competition varies widely from market to market, we face the risk of increased competition, particularly in our more highly populated markets from national, regional and local department and specialty stores. Some of our competitors are considerably larger than us and have substantially greater resources. Although we offer a unique product mix and brands that are not available at certain other retailers, including regional and national department stores, there is no assurance that our existing or new competitors will not carry similar branded merchandise in the future. This may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to traditional store-based retailers, we also face e-commerce competition, which may materially affect our revenues and profitability.\nAn economic downturn or decline in consumer confidence may negatively impact our business and financial condition. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending, such as employment levels, taxes, energy and gasoline prices and other factors influencing consumer confidence. We have extensive operations in the South Central, Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. In addition, many stores are located in small towns and rural environments that are substantially dependent upon the local economy. If there is an economic downturn or decline in consumer confidence, particularly in the South Central, Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and any state from which we derive a significant portion of our net sales (such as Texas or Louisiana), our business, financial condition and cash flows will be negatively impacted and such impact may be material.\nThere can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in economic conditions. Recent economic conditions have not had, nor do we anticipate that current economic conditions will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash flow and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be materially and adversely affected by changes in economic conditions.\nFailure to obtain merchandise product on normal trade terms and/or our inability to pass on any price increases related to our merchandise may adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. We are highly dependent on obtaining merchandise product on normal trade terms. Failure to meet our performance objectives may cause key vendors and factors to become more restrictive in granting trade credit. The tightening of credit, such as a reduction in our lines of credit or payment terms from the vendor or factor community, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flows. We are also highly dependent on obtaining merchandise at competitive and predictable prices. In the event we experience rising prices related to our merchandise, whether due to cost of materials, inflation, transportation costs, or otherwise, and are unable to pass on those rising prices to our customers, our business, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely and materially affected.\nRisks associated with our vendors from whom our products are sourced may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our merchandise is sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors. All of our vendors must comply with applicable laws, including our required standards of conduct. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms and the financial viability of our vendors are beyond our control and may adversely impact our performance.\nRisks associated with our carriers, shippers and other providers of merchandise transportation services may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our vendors rely on shippers, carriers and other merchandise transportation service providers (collectively \"Transportation Providers\") to deliver merchandise from their manufacturers, both in the United States and abroad, to the vendors' distribution centers in the United States. Transportation Providers are also responsible for transporting merchandise from their vendors' distribution centers to our distribution centers. We also rely on Transportation Providers to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers in the case of e-commerce sales. However, if work slowdowns, stoppages, weather or other disruptions affect the transportation of merchandise between the vendors and their manufacturers, especially those manufacturers outside the United States, between the vendors and us, or between us and our e-commerce customers, our business, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nUnusual weather patterns or natural disasters, whether due to climate change or otherwise, may negatively impact our financial condition. Our business depends, in part, on normal weather patterns in our markets. We are susceptible to unseasonable and severe weather conditions, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Any unusual or severe weather, especially in states such as Texas and Louisiana, whether due to climate change or otherwise, may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our business, financial condition and cash flow may be adversely affected if the businesses of our key vendors and their merchandise manufacturers, shippers, carriers and other merchandise transportation service providers, including those outside of the United States, are disrupted due to severe weather, such as, but not limited to, hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, tsunamis or floods, whether due to climate change or otherwise.\nA catastrophic event adversely affecting any of our buying, distribution or other corporate facilities may result in reduced revenues and loss of customers. Our buying, distribution and other corporate operations are in highly centralized locations. Our operations may be materially and adversely affected if a catastrophic event (such as, but not limited to, fire, hurricanes, tornadoes or floods) impacts the use of these facilities. While we have developed contingency plans that would be implemented in the event of a catastrophic event, there are no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining alternative servicing facilities in a timely manner in the event of such a catastrophe.\nWar, acts of terrorism, Mexican border violence, public health issues and natural disasters may create uncertainty and may result in reduced revenues. We cannot predict, with any degree of certainty, what effect, if any, war, acts of terrorism, Mexican border violence, public health issues and natural disasters, if any, will have on us, our operations, the other risk factors discussed herein and the forward-looking statements we make in this Form 10-K. However, the consequences of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nA disruption of our information technology systems may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems for day to day business operations. In addition, as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. Today's information technology risks are largely external and their consequences may affect us. Potential risks include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) an intrusion by a hacker, (ii) the introduction of malware (virus, Trojan horse, spyware), (iii) hardware failure, (iv) outages due to software defects and (v) human error. Although we run anti-virus and anti-spyware software and take other steps to ensure that our information technology systems will not be disabled or otherwise disrupted, there are no assurances that disruptions will not occur. The consequences of a disruption, depending on the severity, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and may expose us to civil, regulatory and industry actions and possible judgments, fees and fines.\nA security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of our, employee or customer information may adversely impact our business, reputation and financial condition. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer, employee or company information may severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt our operations, attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our customer relationships, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. While we have taken significant steps to protect confidential information, there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments will prevent the compromise of customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of our information security were to occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to attract, develop and retain qualified employees may deteriorate the results of our operations. We believe that our competitive advantage is providing well-trained and motivated sales associates in order to provide customers exceptional customer service. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel.\nLaws and regulations may adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. We, like other businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local government laws and regulations including, but not limited to, tax laws. These may change periodically in response to economic or political conditions. We cannot predict whether existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or as reinterpreted in the future, or future laws and regulations, may have a material and adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings. Due to the inherent uncertainties of such matters, we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such matters. The ultimate resolution of these matters may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these matters may result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial attention and resources to defend ourselves.\nIf our trademarks are successfully challenged, the outcome of those disputes may require us to abandon one or more of our trademarks. We regard our trademarks and their protection as important to our success. However, we cannot be sure that any trademark held by us will provide us a competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Although we intend to vigorously protect our trademarks, the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of trademarks can be substantial and the outcome of those disputes may require us to abandon one or more of our trademarks.\nOur dependence upon cash flows and net earnings generated during the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, may have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations. The seasonal nature of the retail industry causes a heavy dependence on earnings in the fourth quarter. A large fluctuation in economic or weather conditions occurring during the fourth quarter may adversely impact our earnings. In preparation for our peak season, we may carry a significant amount of inventory in advance. If, however, we do not manage inventory appropriately or customer preferences change we may need to increase markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of inventory which will negatively impact our financial results.\nCovenants in our Revolving Credit Facility agreement may impose operating restrictions, impede or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common shares and raise capital through the sale of stock and other securities. Our Revolving Credit Facility agreement contains covenants which, among other things, restrict (i) the amount of additional debt or capital lease obligations we may incur, (ii) our payment of dividends and repurchase of common stock under certain circumstances and (iii) related party transactions. A violation of any of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans. Our failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, any material or adverse developments affecting our business may significantly limit our ability to meet our obligations as they become due or to comply with the various covenant requirements contained in our Revolving Credit Facility agreement.\nThe inability or unwillingness of one or more lenders to fund their commitment under our Revolving Credit Facility may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Our Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on October 6, 2019, is a $350.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. We use the Revolving Credit Facility to provide financing for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, as well as to support our outstanding letters of credit requirements. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are: Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, Regions Bank and Bank of America, N.A. Notwithstanding that we may be in full compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, the inability or unwillingness of one or more of those lenders to fund their commitment under our Revolving Credit Facility may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nUnexpected costs may arise from our current insurance program and our financial performance may be affected. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. However, we may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative cost trends in the insurance market, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events, we are self-insured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles. If we experience a greater number of self-insured losses than we anticipate, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThe price of our common stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange may be volatile. Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, general economic and stock market conditions, risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above, strategic actions by us or our competitors, variations in our quarterly operating performance, our future sales or purchases of our common stock and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.", "PERMNO": 89289, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "SSINQ"}
