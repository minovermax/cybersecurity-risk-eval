{"cik": "920465", "company": "LA JOLLA PHARMACEUTICAL CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited financial statements and related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, reputation and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe to be material. In any such case, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are substantially dependent on the commercial success of GIAPREZA\u00ae (angiotensin II) and XERAVA\u00ae (eravacycline).\nThe success of our business is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize GIAPREZA\u00ae (angiotensin II) and XERAVA\u00ae (eravacycline). The market for effective pharmaceutical sales and marketing professionals is competitive, and maintaining these capabilities is expensive and challenging. If we are unable to maintain an effective sales and marketing organization, GIAPREZA and XERAVA sales could be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nIn the U.S. and most major foreign markets, drugs like GIAPREZA and XERAVA that are administered in the hospital must be purchased by the hospital and generally are not directly reimbursed by third-party payors. Hospitals instead are reimbursed for patient cases based on patients\u2019 diagnosed conditions under the U.S. Medicare diagnosis-related group (\u201cDRG\u201d) system or other like systems for non-Medicare patients in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Adoption of new drugs that are administered in the hospital generally occurs more slowly than adoption of new drugs that are taken on an outpatient basis, which generally are paid for by third-party payors. If we are unsuccessful at convincing hospitals and health care providers to increase their rate of adoption of GIAPREZA and XERAVA, our business may suffer.\nCatecholamines (primarily norepinephrine), which are available as generics and inexpensive, are typically used in the first line to treat distributive shock, while vasopressin, including Vasostrict\u00ae (Endo International plc) and Vasopressin (Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), is typically used in the second line. In the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, GIAPREZA demonstrated clinical benefit in patients who were not adequately responding to available vasopressors, including catecholamines and Vasostrict. GIAPREZA\u2019s principal competition as a treatment in patients not adequately responding to available vasopressors is the use of these same vasopressors at increased doses. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nXERAVA competes with a number of antibiotics that are currently marketed for the treatment of cIAI and other multidrug resistant infections, including: AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam, marketed by AbbVie Inc.); MERREM IV\u00ae (meropenem, marketed by AstraZeneca PLC); PRIMAXIN\u00ae (imipenem and cilastatin, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); RECARBRIO\u2122 (imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); TYGACIL\u00ae (tigecycline, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); VABOMERE\u2122 (meropenem and vaborbactam, marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.); ZERBAXA\u00ae (ceftolozane and tazobactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); ZOSYN\u00ae (piperacillin and tazobactam, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); and current and future generic versions of marketed antibiotics. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for XERAVA will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nIn an effort to remain competitive in the marketplace, we may determine, from time to time, to change our pricing, dosage forms and strengths, and other marketing strategies for GIAPREZA and XERAVA, including altering the amount or availability of discounts or rebates. Any such changes could have short-\nterm or long-term negative impacts on our net sales, which would cause our business and results of operations to suffer. Price increases or changes to our marketing strategies may also negatively affect our reputation and our ability to secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for GIAPREZA and XERAVA, which could result in decreased demand and cause our business and results of operations to suffer. If we are unable to successfully price or market GIAPREZA or XERAVA, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA and XERAVA will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nOur estimates of the potential market sizes for GIAPREZA and XERAVA are based on prescription and sales data for relevant in-market products, the results of clinical studies, medical literature and other information. If the potential market sizes for GIAPREZA and XERAVA are smaller than our estimates, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA and XERAVA may be limited, and our business may suffer.\nThe commercial success of GIAPREZA and XERAVA will depend on our ability to obtain an uninterrupted supply of GIAPREZA and XERAVA from our contract manufacturers.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of GIAPREZA or XERAVA. We rely on sole-source contract manufacturers to produce GIAPREZA and XERAVA and expect to continue to do so to meet our development and commercial needs. In all of our manufacturing agreements, we require that contract manufacturers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) and drug products in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (\u201cFDA\u2019s\u201d) current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) and all other applicable laws and regulations. The long-term commercial success of GIAPREZA and XERAVA will depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers to supply cGMP-compliant API and drug product without interruption. If there is an interruption in the supply of GIAPREZA and XERAVA from our contract manufacturers, our business may suffer.\nProduct liability or other lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and reduce GIAPREZA and XERAVA sales.\nPatients suffering from distributive shock are gravely ill and have a high mortality rate. Although 28-day mortality in patients treated with GIAPREZA was lower than in patients treated with placebo in the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, there was a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients treated with GIAPREZA in this study. Some patients who are treated with GIAPREZA will die due to their underlying illness or suffer adverse events (which may or may not be drug related). Additionally, patients suffering from cIAI may become gravely ill and may die due to underlying illness or suffer adverse events (which may or may not be drug related). As such, we may face product liability lawsuits. Although we carry product liability insurance, product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and reduce GIAPREZA and XERAVA sales. Furthermore, any such lawsuits could impair our business reputation and result in the initiation of investigations by regulators.\nAdditionally, we may not have and may not be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses if any claim or lawsuit is brought against us, regardless of the success or failure of the claim or lawsuit. Even where claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity, there can be no assurance that the claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable to cover the cost of such claims. Any such claims or lawsuits could materially impact our financial condition, and our business may suffer.\nOur ability to continue commercializing GIAPREZA is dependent on our fulfillment of contractual obligations under the royalty financing agreement with HealthCare Royalty Partners.\nIn May 2018, we closed a $125.0 million royalty financing agreement (the \u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d) with HealthCare Royalty Partners (\u201cHCR\u201d). Under the terms of the Royalty Agreement, we received $125.0 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA. HCR is entitled to receive quarterly royalties on worldwide net sales of GIAPREZA beginning April 1, 2018. Quarterly payments to HCR under the Royalty Agreement start at a maximum royalty rate, with step-downs based on the achievement of annual net product sales thresholds. Through December 31, 2021, the maximum\nroyalty rate was 10%. Starting January 1, 2022, the maximum royalty rate increased by 4%, and starting January 1, 2024, the maximum royalty rate may increase by an additional 4% if an agreed-upon, cumulative net product sales threshold has not been met. The Royalty Agreement is subject to maximum aggregate royalty payments to HCR of $225.0 million. The Royalty Agreement expires upon the first to occur of January 1, 2031 or when the maximum aggregate royalty payments have been made. The Royalty Agreement was entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary, La Jolla Pharma, LLC, and HCR has no recourse under the Royalty Agreement against La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company or any assets other than GIAPREZA. However, under the terms of the Royalty Agreement, La Jolla Pharma, LLC has certain obligations, including the obligation to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to commercialize GIAPREZA. If La Jolla Pharma, LLC is held to not have met these obligations, HCR would have the right to terminate the Royalty Agreement and demand payment from La Jolla Pharma, LLC of either $125.0 million or $225.0 million (depending on which obligation La Jolla Pharma, LLC is held to not have met), minus aggregate royalties already paid to HCR. In the event that La Jolla Pharma, LLC fails to timely pay such amount if and when due, HCR would have the right to foreclose on the GIAPREZA-related assets.\nThe commercial success of GIAPREZA and XERAVA in certain ex-U.S. territories is dependent on the fulfillment of contractual obligations under the Company\u2019s out-license agreements.\nPAION License\nIn January 2021, La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including La Jolla Pharma, LLC and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement (the \u201cPAION License\u201d) with PAION AG and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, \u201cPAION\u201d). Pursuant to the PAION License, La Jolla granted PAION an exclusive license to commercialize GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively, the \u201cPAION Territory\u201d). La Jolla has received an upfront cash payment of $22.5 million, less a 15% refundable withholding tax, and is entitled to receive potential commercial milestone payments of up to $109.5 million and double-digit tiered royalty payments. In addition, royalties payable under the PAION License will be subject to reduction on account of generic competition and after patent expiration in a jurisdiction. Pursuant to the PAION License, PAION will be solely responsible for the future development and commercialization of GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the PAION Territory. PAION is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the PAION Territory. The Company has not received any payments from PAION related to either royalties or commercial milestones.\nIn July 2021, the Company entered into a commercial supply agreement with PAION whereby the Company will supply PAION a minimum quantity of GIAPREZA and XERAVA through July 13, 2024. The supply agreement will automatically renew until the earlier of July 13, 2027, or until a new supply agreement is executed. During the initial 3-year term of the supply agreement, the Company will be reimbursed for direct and certain indirect manufacturing costs at cost.\nIf the Company is held to not have met its commercial supply obligations, or if PAION is unable to successfully develop and commercialize GIAPREZA or XERAVA in the PAION Territory, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the PAION Territory will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nEverest License\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement with Everest, which was subsequently amended and restated (the \u201cEverest License\u201d). Pursuant to the Everest License, the Company granted Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize XERAVA for the treatment of cIAI and other indications in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Singapore, the Malaysian Federation, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of Indonesia, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of the Philippines (collectively, the \u201cEverest Territory\u201d). The Company is eligible to receive an additional $8.0 million regulatory milestone payment and up to an aggregate of $20.0 million in sales milestone payments. The Company is also entitled to receive tiered royalties from Everest at percentages in the low double digits on sales, if any, in the Everest Territory of products containing eravacycline. Royalties are payable with respect to each jurisdiction in the Everest Territory until the latest to occur of: (i) the last-to-expire of specified patent rights in such jurisdiction in the Everest Territory; (ii) expiration of marketing or regulatory exclusivity in such jurisdiction in the Everest Territory; or (ii) 10 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such jurisdiction in the Everest Territory. In March 2021, the Company received a $3.0 million milestone payment associated with the submission of an NDA with the China National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d) for XERAVA for the treatment of cIAI in patients in China. XERAVA was approved in Singapore by the Health Science Authority in April 2020.\nIn May 2021, the Company entered into a commercial supply agreement with Everest whereby the Company will supply Everest a minimum quantity of XERAVA through December 31, 2023 and will transfer to Everest certain XERAVA-related manufacturing know-how. Pursuant to the supply agreement: (i) the Company has received $6.8 million of upfront payments comprised of: (1) a $4.0 million upfront technology transfer payment; and (2) a $2.8 million partial prepayment for XERAVA that is expected to be delivered to Everest during 2022; (ii) the Company received an additional $1.0 million technology transfer payment in January 2022; and (iii) the Company will be reimbursed for direct and certain indirect manufacturing costs at 110% of cost through December 31, 2023.\nIf the Company is held to not have met its commercial supply obligations, or if Everest is unable to successfully develop and commercialize XERAVA in the Everest Territory, the commercial prospects for XERAVA in the Everest Territory will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nOur overall financial performance, including but not limited to, net product sales and net cash used for or provided by operating activities, may not meet our expectations.\nOur overall financial performance, including but not limited to, net product sales and net cash used for or provided by operating activities, including any milestone, royalty and other payments resulting from La Jolla\u2019s out-license agreements and commercial supply agreements, and any distributions received in connection with our non-voting profits interest, is difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. Historical financial performance may not be indicative of future financial performance. For example, our net product sales may be below expectations, and our costs to operate our business, including cost of product sales, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, could exceed our estimates. Furthermore, we may not receive any future distributions in connection with our non-voting profits interest. If our overall financial performance does not meet our expectations, our business may suffer.\nOur capital requirements and our potential need for, and ability to obtain, additional financing are uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.7 million. GIAPREZA and XERAVA are our approved products and our only sources of net product sales. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts for GIAPREZA and XERAVA, and our ability to control expenses. If necessary, we will raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or collaboration agreements. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we\nneed to raise additional capital and are unable to do so, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nFuture utilization of net operating loss carryforwards or research and development credit carryforwards may be impaired due to changes in ownership.\nOur net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cIRC\u201d). As a result, our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance may be reduced for the estimated impact of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that we estimate may expire unused. Utilization of our remaining net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the IRC and similar state provisions, including those that may come in conjunction with market trades by our stockholders or future equity financings.\nOur ability to hire and retain key employees is uncertain.\nThe market for effective professionals in the pharmaceutical industry is competitive and hiring and retaining these professionals is expensive and challenging. If we are unable to hire and retain key employees, we may be unable to effectively execute on our operating plan, and our business may suffer.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee misconduct, which could include intentional failures to comply with regulatory standards and requirements, such as FDA regulations, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commissions, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in protecting us from governmental actions or lawsuits. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves, those actions, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our products, our product candidates or any other products the Company or its current or future out-licensees may develop from being marketed abroad.\nIn the event the Company or its current or future out-licensees pursue the right to market and sell our products, our product candidates or any other products we may develop in jurisdictions other than the U.S. or the European Union, the Company or its current or future out-licensees would be required to obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in each country or jurisdiction. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA or European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country or jurisdiction. In the event the Company or its current or future out-licensees choose to pursue them, the Company or its current or future out-licensees may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities in such countries on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA or EC does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. If the Company or its current or future out-licensees are unable in the future\nto obtain approval of a product or product candidate by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of that product or product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business may suffer.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to out-license our product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the commercialization of GIAPREZA and XERAVA, we also intend to seek to out-license for our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our efforts to out-license our product candidates will be successful.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nGIAPREZA\u2019s and XERAVA\u2019s market exclusivity periods will depend on the validity and enforceability of issued and pending patents covering GIAPREZA and XERAVA.\nWe depend on patents and other intellectual property rights to prevent others from improperly benefiting from our commercial products, GIAPREZA and XERAVA, and products or inventions that we develop or acquire. For details about our intellectual property portfolio protecting GIAPREZA and XERAVA, see the section titled \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property.\u201d\nWe plan to file additional patent applications that, if issued, would provide further protection for GIAPREZA and XERAVA. Although we believe the bases for these patents and patent applications are sound, they are untested, and there is no assurance that they will not be successfully challenged. There can be no assurance that any patent previously issued or any patent application will protect GIAPREZA or XERAVA from generic competition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that GIAPREZA or XERAVA will not be held to infringe valid patents held by others. If our owned and in-licensed intellectual property do not protect GIAPREZA or XERAVA from generic competition, GIAPREZA or XERAVA net product sales may decline, and/or we may incur additional costs for patent protection, including patent infringement litigation costs arising out of ANDA submissions by generic companies to manufacture and sell generic products or arising out of 505(b)(2) submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If either GIAPREZA or XERAVA is held to infringe valid patents held by others, we could be subject to liability, and our business may suffer.\nOn February 15, 2022, La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (the \u201cCompany\u201d) received a paragraph IV notice of certification (the \u201cNotice Letter\u201d) from Gland Pharma Limited (\u201cGland\u201d) advising that Gland has submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) seeking approval to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of GIAPREZA (angiotensin II) in the U.S. prior to the expiration of certain of the Company\u2019s U.S. GIAPREZA Patents, which are listed in the FDA\u2019s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the \u201cOrange Book\u201d). The Notice Letter alleges that the GIAPREZA Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Gland\u2019s ANDA. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights protecting GIAPREZA, we may incur significant patent litigation costs, and, if Gland is successful in the introduction of the generic product described in Gland\u2019s ANDA, then GIAPREZA net product sales may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our in-license agreements, we may lose rights to critical patents that are important to the commercialization and net sales potential of GIAPREZA and XERAVA.\nWe have licensed patent rights covering GIAPREZA from George Washington University (\u201cGW\u201d) and licensed patent rights covering XERAVA from Harvard University (\u201cHarvard\u201d) and Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cParatek\u201d). If, for any reason, our in-license agreements with GW, Harvard or Paratek are terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it would materially and adversely affect our business. Our in-license agreements with GW, Harvard and Paratek impose, and any future collaboration agreements or license agreements in which we enter are likely to impose, various development,\ncommercialization, commercial supply, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. Failure to fulfill these obligations would pose a material risk to our patent protection and commercial prospects for GIAPREZA and XERAVA, and our business may suffer.\nIf our products or our product candidates infringe the rights of others, we could be subject to expensive litigation, become liable for substantial damages, be required to obtain licenses from others or be prohibited from selling our products or product candidates altogether.\nOur competitors or others may have patent rights that they choose to assert against us or our licensors, licensees, suppliers, customers or potential marketing partners. Moreover, we may not know about patents or patent applications that our products or product candidates could infringe. Because patent applications do not publish for at least 18 months, if at all, and can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our products or product candidates could infringe. In addition, if third parties file patent applications or obtain patents claiming inventions also claimed by us or our licensors in issued patents or pending applications, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) to determine priority of invention. If third parties file oppositions in foreign countries, we may also have to participate in opposition proceedings in foreign tribunals to defend the patentability of claims in our foreign patent applications.\nIf a third party claims that we infringe its proprietary rights, any of the following may occur:\n\u2022\nwe may become involved in time-consuming and expensive litigation, even if the claim is without merit;\n\u2022\nwe may become liable for substantial damages for past infringement if a court decides that we have infringed a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u2022\na court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our products without a license from the patent holder, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or which may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents; or\n\u2022\nwe may have to redesign our products or product candidates so that they do not infringe patent rights of others, which may not be possible or commercially feasible and may require new regulatory approvals.\nAny of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent policy and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. or other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We therefore cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the U.S., prior to March 15, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while, outside the U.S., the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), enacted on September 16, 2011, the U.S. has moved to a first-to-file system. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will\nbe prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In general, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide new opportunities for third parties to challenge issued patents in the USPTO. We may be subject to the risk of third-party prior art submissions on pending applications or become a party to opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patents for our products or product candidates. There is a lower standard of evidence necessary to invalidate a patent claim in a USPTO proceeding relative to the standard in U.S. federal courts. This could lead third parties to challenge and successfully invalidate our patents that would not otherwise be invalidated if challenged through the court system.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the health care industry that could result in substantial penalties for noncompliance.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing the health care industry that could result in substantial penalties for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may impact our ability to operate, including our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by federal, state and foreign governments that govern jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, cash payments, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service or compensation for something other than fair market value.\n\u2022\nFederal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers; improperly promoting a product\u2019s off-label use; violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or misreporting pricing information to government programs.\n\u2022\nFederal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers; improperly promoting a product\u2019s off-label use; violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or misreporting pricing information to government programs.\n\u2022\nProvisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nThe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.\n\u2022\nVarious federal, state and foreign data privacy and security laws and regulations. These include provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations (\u201cHITECH\u201d), which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information in the U.S. and the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union that became effective in May 2018. We may not be directly subject to certain of these laws and regulations, such as privacy and security requirements under HIPAA; however, we may be subject to criminal penalties for knowingly, aiding and embedding these violations.\n\u2022\nSection 1927 of the Social Security Act, which requires that manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered by Medicaid report pricing information to CMS on a monthly and quarterly basis, including the best price available to any customer of the manufacturer, with certain exceptions for government programs, and pay prescription rebates to state Medicaid programs based on a statutory formula derived from reported pricing information.\n\u2022\nVarious state and/or foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, which complicates our compliance efforts.\nIf we are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to substantial penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. If we are subjected to substantial penalties, our business may suffer, and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nDrugs approved by the FDA, EC and/or other regulatory agencies are subject to ongoing regulation.\nAny products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA, EC and/or other regulatory agency approvals may be subject to continuing regulation by such agencies, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA, EC and/or other regulatory agencies and may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by such agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. Even after regulatory approval is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown safety risks, the FDA, EC and/or other regulatory agencies can withdraw approval, recall the product or subject the drug to additional restrictions. In addition, governments outside of the U.S. tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues or our royalty payments received from license agreements.\nBusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, natural disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business.\nBusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, such as war and terrorism, natural disasters, public health crises, such as a pandemic, or other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, if one of these events were to adversely affect one of our contract manufacturers, our supply of GIAPREZA and XERAVA could be interrupted. Furthermore, in the case of a pandemic, the ability of our critical care specialists to access hospitals and call on physicians may be curtailed, which may adversely affect product sales.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our operations and affect our ability to sell GIAPREZA and XERAVA.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic will have on our results from operations, financial condition and our ability to sell GIAPREZA and XERAVA due to numerous factors that are not within our control, including its duration and severity of the outbreak. Stay-at-home orders, business closures, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and employee illness or quarantines could result in disruptions to our operations, which could adversely impact our results from operations and financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in ongoing volatility in financial markets. If our access to capital is restricted or associated borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you may lose all or part of your investment. These fluctuations could be based on various factors, including factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and below:\n\u2022\nchanges in analyst estimates, ratings and price targets;\n\u2022\nnegative press reports or other negative publicity, whether or not true, about our business;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in general;\n\u2022\nmarket sentiment towards pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning the overall economy; and\n\u2022\nmarket sentiment toward equity securities.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of shares of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert the attention of management, result in negative press reports and, if adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have never paid a dividend on shares of our common stock, and you should rely on price appreciation of shares of our common stock for return on your investment.\nWe have never paid a dividend on shares of our common stock. Even if we decide to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors. You should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock and should rely on price appreciation of shares of our common stock for a return, if any, on your investment.\nConversion of our convertible preferred stock would result in substantial dilution for our existing common stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 26.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. We may be required to issue up to approximately 6.7 million additional shares of common stock upon conversion of existing convertible preferred stock. The issuance of these additional shares would represent approximately 20% dilution to our existing common stockholders.\nIf we need to obtain additional financing in the future, such financing could result in dilution to your investment, adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and/or create future operating and financial restrictions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.7 million. GIAPREZA and XERAVA are our approved products and our only source of net product sales. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts for GIAPREZA and XERAVA and our ability to control expenses. If necessary, we will raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, you may suffer dilution to your investment, and such issuance may adversely affect the price per share of our common stock. Any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations, which may include limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or pay dividends.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over the Company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of February 18, 2022, our current directors, officers and stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 52% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these current directors, officers and stockholders, if they act, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. In addition, our current directors, officers and stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale of the Company and could affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law may make a potential acquisition of us more difficult.\nSection 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) makes certain types of unfriendly or hostile corporate takeovers, or other non-board approved transactions involving a corporation and one or more of its significant stockholders, more difficult. It does so by generally prohibiting \u201cbusiness combinations,\u201d including mergers, sales and leases of assets, issuances of securities and similar transactions, by a corporation or a subsidiary with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (generally defined as a person or entity who, together with their affiliates and associates, beneficially owns 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock) within three years after the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are satisfied, such as, in advance of the transaction that resulted in the person exceeding 15% ownership, Board approval of such transaction or the business combination or, following the time of such transaction, approval of the business combination by the Board and two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock, excluding the interested stockholder, voting at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Although we believe that Section 203 will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, the requirements of Section 203 would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nDisclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of computer system failures or security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and interrupt our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, loss of trade secrets or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including protected health information or personal data of employees or former employees, access to our customer or clinical data or disruption of the manufacturing process, we could incur liability and the further development of our products or product candidates could be delayed. We may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other malfeasance by hackers, employees and others. This type of breach of our cybersecurity may compromise our confidential information or our financial information and adversely affect our business or result in legal proceedings.", "PERMNO": 80640, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LJPC"}
