{"cik": "38984", "company": "SIGNATURE GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are in addition to risks that apply to most businesses and are not the only ones we face. The order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight, likelihood or importance. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Real Alloy Acquisition and the Financings\nFollowing the consummation of the Real Alloy Acquisition, we and Real Alloy may incur significant cost, time, effort and attention on integration and the development of necessary support related to its carve-out from Aleris. These may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits of the Real Alloy Acquisition. We are a holding company and Real Alloy represents a significantly larger operating business than Signature. Real Alloy\u2019s predecessor operated substantially on a stand-alone basis from Aleris and maintained its own sales, marketing, product development, manufacturing and other administrative teams, however, it did receive support from Aleris with respect to legal, purchasing, information technology (\u201cIT\u201d), tax and certain other financial and operating services such as human resources (\u201cHR\u201d), insurance and treasury.\nWhile we intend to operate Real Alloy predominantly as a stand-alone business with substantially the same organizational structure, operations, management team, employees and locations as were present prior to the Real Alloy Acquisition, the success of the Real Alloy Acquisition will substantially depend on our ability to incorporate Real Alloy into Signature and support its business needs, as well as effectively manage this significantly larger business. Challenges may include i) the integration of Real Alloy into our accounting reporting system and functions; ii) the development, adaptation and maintenance of the operating and administrative support systems historically provided by Aleris on which Real Alloy has relied, including legal, purchasing, IT, tax, HR, insurance and treasury; and iii) the ability of Real Alloy to adapt to our policies, procedures and support systems, including internal controls.\nThe incorporation of, and development of the necessary support for, Real Alloy could be a lengthy process, requiring substantial expenditures by Signature, as well as significant time, effort and attention from the management teams and key employees of both Signature and Real Alloy. Such demands could divert needed resources from both businesses. Further, these challenges could result in the loss of key employees, disruption of the ongoing businesses and relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, diversion of management and corporate attention to integration issues, tax costs and inefficiencies, and inconsistencies in standards, controls, IT systems, accounting systems, procedures, policies, Sarbanes-Oxley controls and other administrative systems. If any of these factors limit our ability to integrate Real Alloy successfully or on a timely basis, we may not achieve the strategic, operational, financial and other benefits anticipated to result from the Real Alloy Acquisition to the fullest extent, on a timely basis or at all.\nFor a period following the closing of the Real Alloy Acquisition, we and Real Alloy will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our and their businesses. Delays in integrating the business could exacerbate these uncertainties and have adverse effects. Uncertainties about the effect of the Real Alloy Acquisition on the employees and customers of both Signature and Real Alloy may have an adverse effect on Real Alloy and, consequently, us. Although we and Real Alloy have taken, and continue to take, steps to reduce the potential adverse effects during the integration period, these uncertainties may impair our and Real Alloy\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Real Alloy Acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter. These uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Real Alloy, and to a lesser degree, our business, to seek to change their existing business relationships. Alternatively, it could cause third parties who are considering doing business with us or Real Alloy to delay taking action until the Real Alloy Acquisition is fully integrated. Employee retention could be reduced during the integration of the Real Alloy Acquisition, as employees of Signature or Real Alloy may experience uncertainty about their future duties or roles. If, despite retention and business partner management efforts, we or Real Alloy lose key employees or customer/supplier relationships because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process or a desire not to remain with Signature or Real Alloy, the business, operations, prospects and financial results of the Company could be harmed.\nWith the completion of the Real Alloy Acquisition, we operate a substantially larger entity in an industry and locations in which we have not operated, and we are subject to additional regulations, risks and uncertainties that we have not previously faced. These could exceed our expectations and have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Following the consummation of the Real Alloy Acquisition, the size of the Company and our primary operating segments have changed substantially compared with our previous operations. As a result, any risk or uncertainty that is significant to Real Alloy, including those discussed below under \u201c-Risks Related to Real Alloy,\u201d will also be significant to us and have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Real Alloy is unable to maintain compliance with United States federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, civil penalties and criminal sanctions, or costs associated with upgrades to improve facilities or changes in manufacturing processes in order to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance. While we intend to operate Real Alloy largely as a stand-alone business, our results of operations, financial condition and stock price will largely depend on how Real Alloy can handle its business risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may exceed our expectations, and it may take time for us to mitigate them.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, may continue to be volatile, and after the Real Alloy Acquisition, may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares prior to the Real Alloy Acquisition. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. During the past twelve months, our stock price has ranged from $6.35 to $11.75. Our previous business differs significantly from Real Alloy in several ways, including size, industry, geographic area, and applicable regulations. As a result, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of our shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those previously affecting our independent results of operations. In addition, the Company has conducted multiple offerings of common stock as part of the Financings for the Real Alloy Acquisition, which could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock as a result of dilution.\nThe Real Alloy Acquisition may not be accretive to earnings and if not accretive, may cause dilution to our earnings per share. We currently anticipate that the Real Alloy Acquisition will be accretive to our earnings in 2016. This expectation is based on our preliminary estimates, which may change materially. We may encounter additional or unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs, or we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Real Alloy Acquisition. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Real Alloy Acquisition and contribute to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nThe Real Alloy Acquisition may expose us to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we will not be adequately indemnified. The entities acquired in the Real Alloy Acquisition may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations, and for litigation or other claims. While the Real Alloy Purchase Agreement includes indemnification provisions, the total amount of indemnification related to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants is generally capped at $67 million, excluding breaches of certain fundamental representations, and representations relating to taxes and Title IV of ERISA, and, generally, Aleris is not obligated to indemnify us until the aggregate amount of all losses exceeds $3 million. However, certain scheduled environmental matters are subject to a deductible of approximately $23.9 million. Based on these provisions we may incur material liabilities for the past activities of GRSA. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting reputational damage could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have issued $25 million in Series B Preferred Stock to Aleris as partial consideration in the Real Alloy Acquisition, which shares have superior rights to our common stock. In connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition, we issued $25 million of a newly created Series B Preferred Stock to Aleris to be held in an escrow in order to secure Aleris\u2019 indemnification obligations under the Real Alloy Purchase Agreement. The Series B Preferred Stock could have a material impact on the rights of our common stockholders in terms of dividends, repurchases and redemptions by, or in the event of a liquidation of, the Company.\nWe will pay quarterly dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, increasing from 7% for the first eighteen months after the issue date, to 8% for the next twelve months, to 9% thereafter, with dividends payable in kind for the first two years, and thereafter in cash. Other than dividends or distributions payable on our common stock in shares of common stock, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks superior to our common stock in the payment of accrued and accumulated dividends, declaration and payment of new dividends and distributions, and making of redemptions. In addition, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock for a period of two years after the Series B Preferred Stock is issued.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock generally has no voting rights, except, among other customary matters, for any merger (unless the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding or is purchased at the liquidation preference), for any acquisition valued at more than 5% of the consolidated assets of the Company (so long as at least $10 million in aggregate principal amount of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding), or (for the first two years of the Series B Preferred Stock) for the declaration or payment of cash dividends on the common stock or generally the purchase, redemption or acquisition of common stock.\nOur debt agreements as of December 31, 2014, the Financings in connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition, and future debt financing arrangements into which we or our subsidiaries may otherwise enter, may contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests. Failure to comply with these limits could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial results. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $14.6 million of indebtedness outstanding, which was all related to our Industrial Supply segment and has been repaid in full upon the January 9, 2015 closing of the NABCO Sale. Our outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness of Real Alloy and excluding the indebtedness of NABCO, would have been approximately $392.5 million had the Real Alloy Acquisition and the Financings occurred as of December 31, 2014. Further, Real Alloy has additional borrowing capacity under the Asset-Based Facility and\nFactoring Facility. Interest costs related to this indebtedness, together with the dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, will be substantial. The Senior Secured Notes, the Asset-Based Facility, the Factoring Facility and the Series B Preferred Stock, and the instruments governing our other future indebtedness contain, or may contain, certain customary restrictions, covenants, provisions for mandatory repayment upon the occurrence of certain events, and provisions for events of default that will require us or Real Alloy to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, restrict our or Real Alloy\u2019s ability to engage in specified types of transactions, and otherwise limit the distributions of funds from Real Alloy to us. This overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to pay dividends, especially from Real Alloy to us;\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult to satisfy obligations under the terms of this indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to refinance this indebtedness on terms acceptable to Real Alloy or us, or at all;\n\u00b7\nlimit the flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we or Real Alloy operate and increase the vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow to make interest and principal payments on this indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow to distribute to us or to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nrestrict sales of key assets;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to substantially change our business or enter into new lines of business;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or acquisitions or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; or\n\u00b7\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Asset-Based Facility and the Factoring Facility and certain other indebtedness requires us or could require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions and tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios, conditions and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness.\nWith respect to the Real Alloy Acquisition, challenges with integration, the industry, operations and other business, market and acquisition-related risks, as well as various uncertainties and events beyond our control, could affect our ability to comply with such restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under any such financing arrangement, the relevant lenders could assess increased interest rates, accelerate the maturity of the debt or foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. In this event, we may lack sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, any limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt or to take other actions could significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nRisks Related to Signature\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to acquire and integrate businesses that perform and meet expectations after closing. A key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition and integration of profitable operating businesses. We may experience challenges identifying, financing, consummating and integrating such acquisitions. Competition exists in the market for the acquisition of profitable operating companies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms, as suitable financing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nEven if we are successful in completing additional acquisitions, these could require significant investments of capital, management attention, and integration effort. We may also encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies, and retaining key personnel. We may also incur significant goodwill impairment charges in the future. Acquisitions could disrupt relationships with existing customers, suppliers and strategic partners of the newly acquired entities and may create other contractual, intellectual property or employment issues. The acquisition of\nanother company or business may also require us to enter into a business or geographic market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation and increase our operating costs, and these challenges could be magnified as the size of the acquisition increases.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions or that, if consummated, we will realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. Even if we are able to grow and build our operations, any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have experienced substantial losses in recent years and may experience losses in the future. Although we reported net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we reported net losses of $10.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively. Since emerging from Bankruptcy Proceedings in 2010, we have continued to have significant operating costs, including compensation, legal, professional and other outside services expenses, occupancy, and other general and administrative expenses. While we believe we made significant progress in reducing our operating costs since summer 2013, following the NABCO Sale and the consummation of the Real Alloy Acquisition, the nature of our operations and our operating costs have changed significantly. Therefore, we may experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which could make it difficult to fund our operations, finance acquisitions and achieve our business plan, any of which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur ability to use our United States federal NOLs to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of past events, the Financings, the Real Alloy Acquisition or other financings, or as the result of future acquisitions or other issuances or transfers of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we reported United States federal NOLs of approximately $933.6 million, which will begin to expire if not used before the tax year ending December 31, 2027. For accounting purposes, a valuation allowance is required to reduce our potential deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income. As a result of the NABCO Sale, we have released $5.1 million of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2014, and expect to continually review and evaluate the valuation allowance in future periods.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing NOLs could be limited or eliminated as a result of changes in federal tax laws and regulations or should we: i) be found by the IRS to not be able to avail ourselves of Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code in connection with the Plan of Reorganization in 2010; ii) undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as described under Section 382 of the Tax Code; iii) be deemed to have abandoned an active business; or iv) not return to profitability or be only marginally profitable in the future.\nThe Company was incorporated as Fremont in 1972. On June 11, 2010, Fremont completed the Plan of Reorganization and emerged from Bankruptcy Proceedings with its present name, Signature Group Holdings, Inc. Although we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that, as of Signature Nevada\u2019s emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings, it met the criteria under Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code to be able to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs, however, will be subject to significant limitation for federal and California state income tax purposes if the Company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code. For this purpose, an \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value, over a rolling three-year period. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership, which would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs. Separately, any changes to tax rules or the interpretation of tax rules could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs.\nWhile there is no guarantee that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that the Financings and the Real Alloy Acquisition did not result in an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. The Company received an opinion letter (the \u201cSection 382 Opinion Letter\u201d) from its United States tax counsel, Blank Rome LLP, substantially to the effect that the Financings and Real Alloy Acquisition should not result in an \u201cownership change\u201d for United States federal income tax purposes and that the Company may use its NOLs to offset future United States taxable income generated by Real Alloy. The Section 382 Opinion Letter is restricted to the precise terms described therein and the Company or its stockholders may engage in subsequent transactions that would result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d Additionally, the Company adopted the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision in order to protect stockholder value by preserving our NOLs. There is no guarantee, however, that the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets.\nThe amount of our NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our NOLs and other tax assets, which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes in the future. Further, our NOLs only have value to the extent we generate taxable income. If we are unable to generate taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOLs, or if we are only marginally profitable during such period, we will be limited in our ability to utilize the tax benefits related to our NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income to be able to utilize our NOLs prior to their expiration.\nFinally, the use of federal and state NOLs is subject to various tax laws and regulations and the changes in such or the interpretations thereof. In California, for example, during 2011, we were unable to utilize any of our state NOLs due to a state moratorium on the usage of NOLs. While the moratorium expired on December 31, 2011, no assurance can be made that we will be able to use our California state NOLs in the future.\nFunding for our future acquisitions and operations could increase our liabilities, trigger negative tax consequences or dilute, or rank preferentially to, our stockholders. We intend to fund any future acquisition through a mix of our available cash, the sale of equity securities in private placements or in registered offerings under our shelf registration statement declared effective on September 26, 2013 (the \u201cShelf Registration Statement\u201d), rights offerings to existing stockholders, and debt financings. Utilizing these funding sources can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences or substantial capital commitments. Any of these events could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe currently have 9,975,000 shares of blank check preferred stock available for issuance and an effective Shelf Registration Statement. In order to fund our future operations or acquisitions, we may sell equity securities or convertible debt securities, which securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders. In such event, future security holders could be entitled to dividends, liquidation or other transaction preferences, or voting rights that are not provided to our existing common stockholders. Further, with or without preferential terms, future issuances of securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur pending legal proceedings and other contingent liabilities may impact our financial condition and results of operations, lowering our stock price, and limiting our ability to use our common stock as consideration in future transactions. We are subject to a number of lawsuits seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief and have potential other contingent liabilities, including repurchase claims, which relate to Fremont\u2019s prior businesses and are presented in discontinued operations of SGGH, LLC. For a summary of our material legal proceedings, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. Additional litigation may be filed against us or disputes may arise in the future concerning matters involving the discontinued operations. We have been and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all legal proceedings in which we are involved, however, the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the costs to defend the Company in these matters may be significant. In turn, these could have a material impact on the price of our common stock. In addition, a decline in our stock price may limit our ability to utilize our common stock as consideration for potential future acquisitions and other transactions in which we may engage.\nSGGH, LLC has received repurchase claims relating to certain residential mortgage loans sold by our discontinued operations. SGGH, LLC may receive additional claims in the future that, unless withdrawn or settled within the limits of the established repurchase reserve, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, SGGH, LLC had $101.7 million of outstanding repurchase claims associated with claims of breaches of certain representations and warranties related to the residential real estate loans sold by FIL. SGGH, LLC maintains a repurchase reserve for the estimated losses it may experience from repurchase claims, both known and unknown, based on the representations and warranties FIL provided to counterparties that purchased the residential real estate loans, largely from 2002 through 2007. While management believes the $5.5 million repurchase reserve liability is sufficient as of December 31, 2014, the reserve is subjective and is based on management\u2019s current expectations based on facts currently known. Although the last mortgage loan purchase agreement was executed in mid-2007, there is no certainty that other claims will not also be asserted against SGGH, LLC or us. Changing or new facts and circumstances could cause us to increase the repurchase reserve in future periods or may cause us to experience losses in excess of the repurchase reserve liability. Any material increase in, or change in the nature of, repurchase claim activity and payout amounts, the repurchase reserve, or changes in our ability to object to, defend or settle such claims, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our repurchase reserve.\nSGGH, LLC is subject to residential mortgage-backed securities defense, indemnity and contribution claims. In connection with residential mortgage-backed securities offerings (\u201cRMBS Offerings\u201d) involving loans originated by FIL, either or both of FIL and its subsidiary entered into mortgage loan purchase agreements, underwriting agreements and indemnification and contribution agreements, which contained various representations and warranties relating to the loans. Investment banks involved in these RMBS Offerings have been sued in a number of actions concerning their activities related to subprime mortgages (\u201cRMBS Actions\u201d), where neither FIL, nor its subsidiary, are a named defendant. FIL and its subsidiary have received demands for defense, indemnity and contribution from defendants in various RMBS Actions. Each of these demands has been rejected as we believe the demanding parties are being sued for conduct not chargeable to FIL or its subsidiary. There is no assurance that FIL or its subsidiary will not be named as a defendant in additional RMBS Actions or receive additional demands for defense, indemnity and contribution. We intend to vigorously defend any claims seeking defense, indemnity or contribution, but we cannot presently predict whether such claims will be pursued or what the outcome would be. However, if the investment banks suffer losses in connection with RMBS Actions and\nsuccessfully pursue claims against FIL, its subsidiary or us, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel to achieve our business and strategic objectives. We depend on the members of our senior management team, particularly Craig Bouchard, Kyle Ross and Chris Manderson, to execute our business plan and strategy and to manage our business and day-to-day operations, including identifying, structuring, closing and monitoring business acquisitions. These members of our senior management team have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely upon to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, it may take us significant time, effort and cost to identify and hire suitable executives with the appropriate experience and expertise to join the Company, and in the meantime, we may not be able to operate our business or identify and manage our business as we planned. As a result, our ability to compete could be harmed. All of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant changes in our management team, Board of Directors and business strategy during our recent operating history. Our predecessor company emerged from Bankruptcy Proceedings in June 2010 with a new management team and Board, as well as a new business plan and strategy. Since then, we have experienced changes in our Board and management in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Additionally, in the future, we may have turnover in the members of our management team or the Board. Any such future turnover may require time, effort and cost and may divert the attention of the management team and Board away from our operations and business objectives.\nImpairment of our intangible assets could result in significant charges that could adversely impact our future operating results. We have significant intangible assets, including goodwill, which are susceptible to impairment charges as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets on our balance sheet are goodwill and customer relationships, all of which are related to business combinations. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed fair value. We assess finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had identifiable intangible assets with a carrying value of $1.7 million, and goodwill of $17.8 million in our consolidated balance sheets within continuing operations and no identifiable intangible assets, and no goodwill within discontinued operations. Following the NABCO Sale, we have identifiable intangible assets with a carrying value of $0.1 million, and no goodwill within continuing operations. As a result of the Real Alloy Acquisition, both intangible assets and goodwill have increased substantially. Adverse changes in the operations of our businesses or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge in future periods that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in that period.\nSGGH, LLC has $5.1 million in remaining unpaid bankruptcy claims that could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources and distract our management team if we are unsuccessful in objecting to, litigating or settling these matters in the near future. As of December 31, 2014, there remained two open unpaid claims filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, Santa Ana Division (the \u201cCalifornia Federal Bankruptcy Court\u201d) totaling $5.1 million. SGGH, LLC plans to continue to litigate those claims, which litigation has been costly both in terms of legal fees, as well as management\u2019s time in addressing these matters. If SGGH, LLC is unsuccessful in resolving such litigation in the near future, or is unable to negotiate substantially reduced settlements for the remaining claims, and SGGH, LLC is obligated to pay these amounts, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for additional information about the \u201cColburn\u201d and \u201cWalker\u201d matters.\nWe have continuing indemnity obligations in connection with the NABCO Sale. Under the NABCO Purchase Agreement we and SGGH, LLC each have customary indemnification obligations related to our representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations. While the indemnification is capped at an aggregate of $7.8 million for breaches of most representations and warranties, other indemnification obligations are not limited. Should a significant claim arise that exceeds the $3.9 million in escrowed indemnification funds, we could be required to pay a material amount of our available cash to fund or address any such indemnified liability, including the costs of negotiating or defending claims from the purchasers of NABCO or third parties and the final costs of the underlying liability.\nOur operations may not perform as expected and we may not realize full value for assets we sell. Based on any number of factors, our operations may not perform as expected. As a result, we may from time to time decide to sell operating subsidiaries or assets. As discussed above, we sold NABCO on January 9, 2015, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such future transactions. If such a transaction is completed, it may reduce the size of our business. There is also no assurance that we will receive adequate consideration in the disposition of any operating subsidiary or asset. As a result, our future disposition of operating subsidiaries or assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or experience material weaknesses in our system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis and may not be able to detect fraud, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and our common stock price. As of December 31, 2014, our management believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are operating effectively. However, management previously identified a material weakness in our system of internal controls. As determined as of December 31, 2011, we had a material weakness related to our inability to maintain a sufficient number of financial and accounting personnel with the appropriate level of accounting knowledge and experience in order to provide timely, accurate and reliable financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, our management a) acquired accounting and financial reporting resources with the appropriate accounting knowledge and experience, and b) implemented new disclosure controls and procedures, which, we believe, remediated the material weakness as of September 30, 2012.\nIf we fail to maintain or enhance our internal control over financial reporting or fail to properly maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to detect fraud or to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis. The existence of any such deficiencies and/or weaknesses, even if cured, could also lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock. Such deficiencies or material weaknesses may also subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other penalties.\nWe have a lean operations staff that we believe is appropriate for our current business. In addition, our business strategy contemplates the acquisition of businesses and the operation of subsidiaries whose financial results will be consolidated into our financial statements and reporting. As a result of these business activities and our future growth, the scope of our internal control over financial reporting will have to expand, which may subject us to increased internal control risks, especially as new businesses are integrated into our processes. Effective internal control over financial reporting must be established and maintained in connection with these acquisitions, if any, in order for us to produce accurate and timely financial reports. Failure to do so would result in our inability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, and possibly lead to other deficiencies, which would likely have a negative impact on the market value of our common stock.\nFurthermore, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act currently requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report. We are also subject to the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not be able to complete the work required for such attestations on a timely basis and, even if we timely complete such requirements, we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The inability to obtain such attestation could lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and may impair our ability to raise capital under our Shelf Registration Statement.\nWe may not obtain the expected benefits of the Reincorporation, from a Nevada corporation to a Delaware corporation. We completed the Reincorporation to take advantage of the benefits of Delaware law and provide us with additional flexibility as we pursue our goal of growth through acquisitions. These expected benefits may not be obtained if we fail to complete acquisitions or if market conditions or other circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic, business and financing flexibility that it affords us. In addition, our holding company structure may not keep the assets and liabilities of the Company and any new businesses we acquire legally separate. As a result, we may have incurred the costs of implementing the Reincorporation without realizing the possible benefits. These costs include the increased administrative costs and expenses associated with keeping separate records, and in some cases making separate regulatory filings for the Company and SGGH, LLC.\nAs a holding company, Signature depends in large part on funding from its operating subsidiaries. Signature is a holding company with no current business operations of its own. Until it has either formed or acquired other companies, its only significant assets are its cash and interests in Real Alloy Parent and SGGH, LLC. As a result, we may rely on funding from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations. If Real Alloy Parent and SGGH, LLC need to retain their funds to meet their financial obligations or experience other restrictions on their ability to fund Signature, that may limit Signature\u2019s access to funds and ability to pursue its acquisition strategy or other strategic objectives.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber-security threats, giving unauthorized persons access to, and the ability to misappropriate, our customer data and proprietary business information. In our operations, we store and transmit our proprietary information and that of our customers. We have offices, operations and employees in various locations throughout the United States, and following the Real Alloy Acquisition, considerably more locations in the United States, Europe, Canada and Mexico. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations. Further, as our present principal business, Real Alloy does not have long-term contracts with all of its large customers, its business and revenues are dependent upon the trust and satisfaction of its customers.\nDespite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information that has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, if we select a vendor that uses cyber or \u201ccloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our attractiveness as a business partner could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nChanges in, and compliance with, laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. We are subject to regulation at the federal, state, local and foreign level, as may be any entity we acquire. Further, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, potentially with retroactive effect, any of which could harm us, our operations, our plans and our stockholders. Changes to laws and regulations may cause us to alter our business strategy in order to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences in the strategies and plans set forth in this Annual Report. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our inability to comply with the federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations in the business segments, geographic regions and jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nRisks Related to Real Alloy\nThe cyclical nature of the metals industry, Real Alloy\u2019s end-use segments and the industries of Real Alloy\u2019s customers could limit operating flexibility and could negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The metals industry is generally cyclical in nature. It tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general macro and local economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the level of economic growth, financing availability, the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, demand for automobiles and housing. Historically, in periods of recession or periods of minimal economic growth, metals companies have often tended to underperform other sectors. Real Alloy is particularly sensitive to trends in the transportation industry, which is seasonal, highly cyclical and dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, during recessions or periods of low growth, the transportation industry typically experiences major cutbacks in production, resulting in decreased demand for inputs such as aluminum. This may lead to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for Real Alloy\u2019s products and services. Because Real Alloy generally has some fixed costs, its near-term profitability can be significantly affected by decreased processing volume. Accordingly, reduced demand and pricing pressures may significantly reduce its profitability and adversely affect its financial condition. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a prolonged recession in its principal industry segments have had a negative impact on the operations of Real Alloy\u2019s predecessor and could have a negative impact on Real Alloy\u2019s future financial condition or results of operations. In addition, global economic and commodity trends have been increasingly correlated in recent years. Although Real Alloy will continue to seek to diversify its business on a geographic and industry end-use basis, there can be no assurance that diversification will significantly mitigate the effect of cyclical downturns.\nChanges in the market price of aluminum scrap impact the selling prices of Real Alloy\u2019s products and the margins it makes from selling its products and services. Market prices are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which Real Alloy has minimal or no control, including:\n\u00b7\nregional and global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\navailability and relative pricing of metal substitutes;\n\u00b7\nlabor costs;\n\u00b7\nenergy prices;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental and conservation regulations;\n\u00b7\nseasonal factors and weather; and\n\u00b7\nimport and export levels and/or restrictions.\nReal Alloy requires substantial amounts of capital to operate; failure to maintain sufficient liquidity will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy requires substantial amounts of capital to operate and its liquidity can be adversely affected by a number of factors outside its control. Fluctuations in aluminum prices may result in increased cash costs for metal scrap and increase our working capital needs. In addition, if aluminum price movements result in a negative valuation of its current financial derivative positions, our counterparties may require posting of cash collateral. Furthermore, in an environment of falling aluminum prices, the borrowing base and availability under Real Alloy\u2019s then-current borrowing facilities may shrink and constrain Real Alloy\u2019s liquidity.\nReal Alloy requires substantial capital investments that it may be unable to fulfill. The operations of Real Alloy are capital intensive. Its predecessor\u2019s total capital expenditures were $50 million, $56 million, $37 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Real Alloy may not generate sufficient operating cash flows and its external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable it to make anticipated capital expenditures, service or refinance indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If Real Alloy is unable to make upgrades or purchase new equipment, its financial condition and results of operations could be affected by higher maintenance costs, lower sales volumes due to the impact of reduced product quality, and other competitive influences.\nThe loss of certain members of the management team of Real Alloy may have an adverse effect on its operating results. The success of Real Alloy will depend, in part, on the efforts of senior management and other key employees. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of its business. If Real Alloy loses or suffers an extended interruption in the services of one or more of its senior officers, its financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. Moreover, the pool of qualified individuals may be highly competitive and Real Alloy may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of senior management or other key employees, should the need arise.\nReal Alloy may be unable to effectively manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and its hedging activities may affect profitability in a changing metals price environment and subject its earnings to greater volatility from period-to-period. Significant increases in the price of primary aluminum, aluminum scrap, alloys, hardeners, commodity inputs, or energy would cause the cost of sales for Real Alloy to increase significantly and, if not offset by product price increases, would negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy is a substantial consumer of raw materials, and by far the largest input cost in producing its goods is the cost of aluminum and aluminum scrap. The cost of energy used, however, is also substantial. In the case of buy/sell arrangements, customers pay for products based on the indexed prices or based on a fixed price. Under tolling arrangements, customers pay Real Alloy a processing fee. In general, Real Alloy uses these pricing mechanisms to pass changes in the price of aluminum and scrap, and, sometimes, commodities, through to its customers. Buy/sell arrangements may require Real Alloy to purchase raw materials in future periods, exposing it to the risk that increased aluminum or energy prices will increase the cost of its products, thereby reducing or eliminating the margin Real Alloy receives when it delivers the product. These risks may be exacerbated by the failure of customers to pay for products on a timely basis, or at all.\nSimilarly, as Real Alloy maintains substantial quantities of raw material and finished goods inventories, significant decreases in the price of aluminum and scrap would reduce the realizable value of its inventory, negatively affecting its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a drop in aluminum prices between the date of purchase and the final settlement date on derivative contracts used to mitigate the risk of price fluctuations may require it to post additional margin, which, in turn, can be a significant demand on liquidity.\nHistorically, GRSA purchased and sold London Metal Exchange (\u201cLME\u201d) forwards, futures and options contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in aluminum prices in its European operations. The ability to realize the benefit of a hedging program is dependent upon factors beyond its control, such as counterparty risk, as well as its receiving timely payments from customers. In addition, at certain times, hedging options may be unavailable or not available on terms acceptable to Real Alloy. In certain scenarios when market price movements result in a decline in value of its current derivatives position, its mark-to-market expense may exceed its credit line and counterparties may request the posting of cash collateral. Despite the use of LME forwards, futures and options contracts, Real Alloy will remain exposed to the variability in prices of aluminum scrap. While aluminum scrap is typically priced in relation to prevailing aluminum index prices (LME, Platts 380, Metal Bulletin 226, etc.), certain scrap types used in Real Alloy\u2019s operations are not highly correlated to an underlying LME price and, therefore, are not hedged. Scrap is also priced at a discount to selling prices. This discount is referred to in the industry as the \u201cscrap spread\u201d and fluctuates depending upon industry conditions. In addition, GRSA purchased forwards, futures or options contracts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices. It did not account for forwards, futures, or options contracts as hedges of the underlying risks. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments were reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The inclusion of such unrealized gains and losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of underlying operating performance.\nReal Alloy may encounter increases in the cost, or limited availability, of raw materials and energy, which could cause the cost of sales to increase thereby reducing operating results and limiting operating flexibility. Real Alloy requires substantial amounts of raw materials and energy in its business, consisting principally of aluminum scrap, primary-based aluminum, alloys and other materials, and natural gas. Any substantial increases in the cost of raw materials or energy could cause operating costs to increase and negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAluminum scrap, primary aluminum, and hardener prices are subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations. Metallics (primary aluminum metal, aluminum scrap and aluminum dross) represent the largest component of the costs of sales. Real Alloy purchases aluminum primarily from aluminum scrap dealers, primary aluminum producers and other intermediaries. Real Alloy has limited control over the price or availability of these supplies.\nThe availability and price of aluminum scrap depends on a number of factors outside of the control of Real Alloy, including general economic conditions, international demand for metallics and internal recycling activities by primary aluminum producers and other consumers of aluminum. Increased regional and global demand for aluminum scrap can have the effect of increasing the prices that Real Alloy pays for these raw materials thereby increasing the cost of sales. Real Alloy may not be able to adjust the selling prices for its products to recover the increases in scrap prices. If scrap and dross prices were to increase significantly without a commensurate increase in the traded value of the primary metals or of the indices on which sales are made, the future financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy could be affected by higher costs and lower profitability. In addition, a significant decrease in the pricing spread between aluminum scrap and primary aluminum could make recycling less attractive compared to primary production, and thereby reduce customer demand for Real Alloy\u2019s recycling services.\nAfter raw material and labor costs, utilities represent the third largest component of the cost of sales. The price of natural gas, and therefore the costs, can be particularly volatile. Price, and volatility, can differ by global region based on supply and demand, political issues and government regulation, among other things. As a result, Real Alloy\u2019s natural gas costs may fluctuate dramatically, and it may not be able to reduce the effect of higher natural gas costs on its cost of sales. If natural gas costs increase, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Although Real Alloy attempts to mitigate volatility in natural gas costs through the use of hedging and the inclusion of price escalators and pass-through mechanisms, it may not be able to eliminate the effects of such cost volatility. Furthermore, in an effort to offset the effect of increasing costs, it may have also limited its potential benefit from declining costs.\nIf Real Alloy were to lose order volumes from any of its largest customers, its sales volumes, revenues and cash flows could be reduced. Real Alloy is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. Its ten largest customers were responsible for approximately 50% of its volume invoiced for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. No one customer accounted for more than 15% of those volumes. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy by lowering sales volumes and lowering profitability. In addition, Real Alloy\u2019s strategy of having dedicated facilities and arrangements with customers subject it to the inherent risk of increased dependence on a single or a few customers with respect to these facilities. In such cases, the loss of such a customer, or the reduction of that customer\u2019s business at one or more of its facilities, could negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations, and Real Alloy may be unable to timely replace, or replace at all, lost order volumes. In addition, several of Real Alloy\u2019s customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to Real Alloy\u2019s predecessor in recent years. Similar incidents in the future would adversely impact the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy does not have long-term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of its customers, and sales volumes and revenues could be reduced if those customers switch their suppliers. A substantial amount of Real Alloy\u2019s volume is sold to customers under contractual arrangements of one year or less or on a purchase order basis. Customers may choose not to continue to purchase products and services from Real Alloy. Any significant loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material negative impact on the sales volume and business of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy may not be able to compete successfully in the industry segments it serves and aluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce Real Alloy\u2019s share of industry sales, sales volumes and selling prices. Aluminum competes with other materials such as steel, plastic, composite materials and glass for various applications. Higher aluminum prices tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials.\nReal Alloy competes with other aluminum recyclers in segments that are highly fragmented and characterized by smaller, regional operators. The principal factors of competition in the aluminum recycling business include price, metal recovery rates, proximity to customers, customer service, molten metal delivery capability, environmental and safety regulatory compliance, and types of services offered. Many of the customers of Real Alloy also have the capability to recycle scrap and may choose to bring more of their recycling volumes within their own operations.\nWith its international business, Real Alloy encounters the risk that non-U.S. governments could take actions to enhance local production or local ownership at its expense.\nAdditional competition could result in a reduced share of industry sales or reduced prices for the products and services of Real Alloy, which could decrease revenues or reduce volumes, either of which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal Alloy\u2019s predecessor has been shaped by acquisition and divestiture, and we will continue to evaluate future acquisitions and divestitures. Past and future acquisitions or divestitures may not be successful, which could adversely affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition. The future financial performance and success of Real Alloy will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its business strategy on a stand-alone basis. Part of the business strategy for Real Alloy has been, and will continue to be, the opportunistic pursuit of strategic acquisitions and dispositions. However, there can be no assurance that any such growth efforts will be successful, or that if successful, Real Alloy will be able to effectively manage expanded or acquired operations. The ability of Real Alloy to achieve its expansion and acquisition needs and objectives and to effectively manage its growth depends on numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the following:\n\u00b7\nits ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to integrate new business into Real Alloy\u2019s operations;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital on acceptable terms to finance acquisitions (including in light of the terms of the indebtedness under the Financings);\n\u00b7\nthe ability to generate the cost savings or synergies anticipated;\n\u00b7\nthe inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u00b7\nincreasing demands on Real Alloy\u2019s operational systems; and\n\u00b7\nthe amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, the process of integrating new businesses could cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the existing Real Alloy business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of new businesses or divestiture of existing businesses could negatively impact Real Alloy and its results of operations. Furthermore, any acquisition could result in significant increases in outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. The terms of this indebtedness may further limit the acquisitions that Real Alloy can pursue.\nFurther aluminum industry consolidation could impact Real Alloy. The aluminum industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years, and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although recent industry consolidation has not negatively impacted Real Alloy\u2019s predecessor, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.\nA portion of the sales of Real Alloy is derived from its international operations, which exposes Real Alloy to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad. Real Alloy has aluminum recycling operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Norway and Canada and magnesium recycling operations in Germany. Real Alloy continues to explore opportunities to expand its international operations. Real Alloy\u2019s international operations generally are subject to risks, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in United States and foreign governmental regulations, trade restrictions and laws, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with United States and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and silimar anti-corruption laws in the United Kingdom and Germany, and export controls and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises or government policies favoring local production;\n\u00b7\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u00b7\ncurrency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits;\n\u00b7\ndiffering protections for intellectual property and enforcement thereof;\n\u00b7\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and social instability.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could cause costs to rise, limit growth opportunities or have a negative effect on Real Alloy\u2019s operations and ability to plan for future periods, and subject it to risks not generally prevalent in the United States.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of the operating entities of Real Alloy are reported in various currencies and then translated into United States dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in its audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of USD against these currencies may have a negative impact on reported revenues and operating profit, and the resulting accounts receivable, while depreciation of USD against these currencies may generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit. In addition, a portion of the revenues generated by its international operations are denominated in USD, while the majority of costs incurred are denominated in local currencies. As a result, appreciation in USD may have a positive impact on earnings while depreciation of USD may have a negative impact on earnings.\nCurrent environmental liabilities as well as the cost of compliance with, and liabilities under, health and safety laws could increase the operating costs of Real Alloy and negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy\u2019s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites, and employee health and safety. Future environmental regulations could impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which it operates. Additional pollution control equipment, process changes, or other environmental control measures may be needed at some of its facilities to meet future requirements.\nFinancial responsibility for contaminated property can be imposed on Real Alloy where current operations have had an environmental impact. Such liability can include the cost of investigating and remediating contaminated soil or ground water, fines and penalties sought by environmental authorities, and damages arising out of personal injury, contaminated property and other toxic tort claims, as well as lost or impaired natural resources. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for certain kinds of matters, such that a person can be held liable without regard to fault for all of the costs of a matter even though others were also involved or responsible. Future remedial requirements at currently owned or operated properties or adjacent areas could result in significant liabilities.\nChanges in environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement could materially increase costs. For example, if salt cake, a by-product of aluminum recycling operations, were to become classified as a hazardous waste in the United States, the costs to manage and dispose of it would increase and could result in significant increased expenditures.\nReal Alloy could experience labor disputes that could disrupt its business. Approximately 25% of Real Alloy employees in North America and substantially all of the employees located in Europe, where union membership is common, are represented by unions or equivalent bodies and are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. Although Real Alloy believes they will successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements when the current agreements expire, these negotiations may not prove successful, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption or cessation of its operations.\nLabor negotiations may not conclude successfully, and, in that case, work stoppages or labor disturbances may occur. Any such stoppages or disturbances may have a negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations by limiting plant production, sales volumes and profitability.\nNew government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may subject Real Alloy to significant new costs and restrictions on its operations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide, including recently announced, long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments by the United States and China. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are legislative and regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions that would institute a cap-and-trade system, covering various sectors of the economy, under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where Real Alloy has manufacturing plants, are considering greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of these plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity derived from various sources, and natural gas. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity that Real Alloy purchases, increase the cost of its use of natural gas, restrict access to, or the use of, natural gas, require Real Alloy to purchase allowances to offset its emissions or result in an overall increase in the cost of raw materials. Any one of these developments could significantly increase Real Alloy\u2019s costs, reduce its competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect its business, operations or financial results. While future emissions regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict specifically how such regulation might affect Real Alloy\u2019s business, operations or financial results.\nThe profitability of Real Alloy depends, in part, on the availability of an adequate source of raw materials. Real Alloy depends on scrap for its operations and acquires its scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metals to us. In periods of low industry prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap waiting for higher prices. In addition, the slowdown in industrial production and consumer consumption in the United States and Europe during past economic crises may have reduced the supply of scrap metal available to Real Alloy. In addition, exports of scrap out of North America and Europe can negatively impact scrap availability and scrap spreads. If an adequate supply of scrap metal is not available, Real Alloy would be unable to recycle metals at desired volumes and its results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe operations of Real Alloy present significant risk of injury or death. It may be subject to claims that are not covered by or exceed its insurance. Because of the heavy industrial activities conducted at its facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to employees and visitors of Real Alloy, notwithstanding the safety precautions taken. These operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. While Real Alloy has policies to minimize such risks in place, it may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed its insurance coverage and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy and on the cost of its hedging activities. Real Alloy uses over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives products to hedge its metal commodity and natural gas risks and, historically, currency risks. Legislation in Europe and the United States has been adopted to increase the regulatory oversight of the OTC derivatives markets and impose restrictions on certain derivative transactions, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. A significant number of the final rules and regulations pursuant to this legislation have not been adopted and not all compliance dates have been reached. If future rules and regulations subject Real Alloy to additional capital or margin requirements, reduce the number of eligible derivatives counterparties, or impose other restrictions on its trading and commodity positions, they could have an adverse effect on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy and on the costs of its hedging activities.\nCertain German pension and benefit obligations of Real Alloy are currently underfunded. Real Alloy may have to make significant cash payments to certain German pension plans, which would reduce the cash available for its business and have an adverse effect on its business financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Since the predecessor entity of Signature Nevada emerged from Bankruptcy Proceeding in June 2010, the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock has varied significantly, from a low closing sales price per share of $2.31 per share in the second quarter of 2012, to a high closing price per share of $14.10 in the third quarter of 2013. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nchanges or variations in earnings and/or operating results;\n\u00b7\nour ability to complete acquisitions on a timely and cost-effective basis, and generate the expected benefits from such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nchallenges to our NOLs or any inability to fully utilize our NOLs prior to their expiration;\n\u00b7\nshortfalls in operating revenues or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the value of our assets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing accounting principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions;\n\u00b7\nthe commencement or outcome of material litigation involving the Company, our subsidiaries, or the industries in which we have exposure, or both;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u00b7\ndeparture of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market volatility, economic trends and other external factors.\nOur outstanding Warrants have special participation rights in connection with the Rights Offering which, among other things, could result in their exercise of subscription rights until April 28, 2015, or a later date if extended by our Board, which may dilute the ownership of our common stockholders. The terms applicable to our 1.5 million outstanding Warrants provide special rights to such Warrantholders in respect of participation in the Rights Offering. First, Warrantholders received 20 calendar days advance notice of the Rights Offering Effective Date of the Rights Offering in order to provide such Warrantholders with additional time to exercise their Warrants in advance of the Rights Offering Effective Date. Second, Warrantholders have a period of 90 calendar days following the Rights Offering Effective Date (i.e., until 5:00 pm, New York City time, April 28, 2015) in which to exercise their subscription rights in respect of the shares of common stock for which such Warrants could have been exercised immediately prior to the Rights Offering Effective Date. Finally, if the Company does not issue subscription rights following the Warrantholder\u2019s request in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then upon any eventual exercise of a Warrant, the Warrantholder will receive the subscription rights that such Warrantholder would have been entitled, along with the common stock for which the Warrant was exercised. As a result, our Warrantholders have a much longer period of time to exercise basic and oversubscription rights than our common stockholders had. As a result of the future issuances of shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of the subscription and oversubscription rights of Warrantholders, our common stockholders may experience additional dilution from the Rights Offering.\nWe and our predecessors have not paid cash dividends since 2006 and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We are a holding company that does not operate any business that is separate from those of SGGH, LLC and Real Alloy Parent and their subsidiaries. We are therefore dependent on SGGH, LLC and Real Alloy Parent for any funds from which to pay dividends. We and our predecessors have not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of 2006, and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, but rather expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business.\nIn addition, our future cash dividends would be limited by the terms of certain of the Financings and the Series B Preferred Stock. Because we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, holders of our common stock will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates, which we cannot assure.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions to protect the value of our NOLs. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us, which may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nOur Rights Agreement could discourage, delay or prevent takeover attempts. Attempts to acquire control of the Company may be discouraged, delayed or prevented by that certain Rights Agreement, dated October 23, 2007, as amended, between our predecessor, Fremont General Corporation, a Nevada corporation, and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d) which was adopted to protect the value of our NOLs and continues to remain in effect. The Rights Agreement provides for a dividend distribution of ten rights for each outstanding share of our common stock. The Rights Agreement also provides that, in the event that (i) we engage in a merger or other business combination transaction in which we are not the surviving corporation; (ii) we engage in a merger or other business combination transaction in which we are the surviving corporation and our common stock is changed or exchanged; or (iii) 50% or more of our assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right (except Rights that have previously been voided because they were held by the acquiring person or entity) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company as set forth in the Rights Agreement. The existence of the Rights Agreement may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from effecting a change of control or takeover of the Company in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX Marketplace, which may not provide investors with a meaningful degree of liquidity. Bid quotations for our common stock are available on the OTCQX Marketplace (the \u201cOTCQX\u201d), an electronic quotation service for securities traded over-the-counter. Bid quotations can be sporadic and may not provide any meaningful liquidity to investors. There can be no assurance that an active market will develop for our common stock or that a stockholder will ever be able to liquidate shares of common stock without considerable delay, if at all. Many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 37699, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "ELLH"}
