We have completed a number of acquisition transactions in recent years. We expect that we will continue to seek acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, capital equipment and technologies to add products and services for our core customer base and for related markets, and will also continue to expand each of our businesses geographically. The success of the completed transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel and to apply our manufacturing processes and controls to the acquired businesses. Although our acquisition strategy generally emphasizes the retention of key management of the acquired businesses and an ability of the acquired business to continue to operate independently, various changes may be required to integrate the acquired businesses into our operations, to assimilate new employees and to implement reporting, monitoring and forecasting procedures. Business and capital equipment acquisitions entail a number of other risks, including as applicable:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of liabilities;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from our existing businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies, installation schedules and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndecrease in our cash or an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital\nwhen needed; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with investments where we do not have full operational control.\nOur failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could cause us to incur increased expenses or to fail to realize the benefits we anticipated from the transactions.\nWe operate in cyclical markets.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from the highly cyclical aerospace and power generation markets. Our sales to the aerospace industry constituted 70 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2015. Our sales to the power market constituted 17 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2015.\nThe commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries continue to face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S. and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns and environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines. Accordingly, the timing, duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty. Downturns or reductions in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe power generation market is also cyclical in nature. Demand for power generation products is global and is affected by the state of the U.S. and world economies, the availability of financing to power generation project sponsors, the political environments of numerous countries and environmental constraints imposed upon power project operators. The availability of fuels and related prices also have a large impact on demand. Reductions in demand for our power generation products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services to customers in the oil and gas, automotive, chemical and petrochemical, medical, industrial process, and other general industrial markets. Each of these markets is cyclical in nature, and the market for oil and gas products can be particularly volatile. Customer demand for our products or services in these markets may fluctuate widely depending upon U.S. and world economic conditions, the availability of financing and industry-specific factors, which for the oil and gas market include the levels of exploration, development, and production activity of oil and natural gas companies and the trends in oil and natural gas prices. Cyclical declines or sustained weakness in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on a small number of direct and indirect customers.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted with a relatively small number of large direct and indirect customers, including General Electric Company, United Technologies Corporation, Rolls Royce plc, Airbus, Spirit AeroSystems, and The Boeing Company. General Electric accounted for approximately 13 percent of our total sales for fiscal 2015. No other customer directly accounted for more than 10 percent of total sales; however, Boeing, Airbus, Rolls Royce, Spirit AeroSystems, and United Technologies are also considered key customers. A financial hardship experienced by any one of these key customers,\nthe loss of any of them or a reduction in or substantial delay of orders from any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our aerospace products are ultimately used in the production of new commercial aircraft. There are only two primary manufacturers of large commercial aircraft in the world, Boeing and Airbus. A significant portion of our aerospace sales are dependent on the number of new aircraft built by these two manufacturers, which is in turn dependent on a number of factors over which we have little or no control. Those factors include the demand for new aircraft from airlines around the globe and factors that impact manufacturing capabilities, such as the availability of raw materials and manufactured components, changes in the regulatory environment and labor relations between the aircraft manufacturers and their work forces. A significant interruption or slowdown in the number of new aircraft built by aircraft manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales to the military sector constituted approximately 10 percent of our fiscal 2015 sales. Defense spending is subject to appropriations and to political pressures that influence which programs are funded and which are canceled. Reductions in domestic or foreign defense budgets or military aircraft procurement, delays in funding or reprioritization of government spending away from defense programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends, in part, on the success of new commercial and military aircraft programs.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the success of new commercial and military aircraft programs including the Boeing 787, Boeing 737Max, Boeing 777X, Airbus A350, Airbus A320neo, Airbus A330neo and programs. We are currently under contract to supply components for a number of new commercial, general aviation and military aircraft programs. These new programs as well as certain existing aircraft programs are scheduled to have production increases over the next several years. Our failure to accelerate production levels to timely match these order increases could have a material adverse effect on our business. Cancellation, reductions or delays of orders or contracts by our customers on any of these programs, or regulatory or certification-related groundings or other delays to any new aircraft programs or to the scheduled production increases for existing aircraft programs, could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe competitive nature of our business results in pressure for price concessions to our customers and increased pressure to reduce our costs.\nWe are subject to substantial competition in all of the markets we serve, and we expect this competition to continue. As a result, we have made significant long-term price concessions to our customers in the aerospace and power generation markets from time to time, and we expect customer pressure for further long-term price concessions to continue. Maintenance of our market share will depend, in part, on our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost-competitive. If we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing, our profitability will suffer. Our effectiveness in managing our cost structure will be a key determinant of future profitability and competitiveness.\nOur business is dependent on a number of raw materials that are subject to volatility in price and availability.\nWe use a number of raw materials in our products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, various rare earth elements, and titanium-containing feedstock ore (natural rutile and upgraded ilmenite), which are found in only a few parts of the world, are available from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, are considered conflict minerals for U.S. regulatory purposes if originating in certain countries. The availability and costs of these metals and elements may be influenced by private or government cartels, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas imposed by governments in countries with rare earth element supplies, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. These raw materials are required for the alloys or processes used or manufactured in our investment cast products, forged products and airframe products segments. We have escalation clauses for nickel, titanium and other metals in a number of our long-term contracts with major customers, but we are not usually able to fully offset the effects of changes in raw material costs. We also employ \u201cprice-in-effect\u201d metal pricing in our alloy production businesses to lock-in the current cost of metal at the time of production or time of shipment. The ability of key metal suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Future shortages (either to us or our customers) or price fluctuations in raw materials could result in decreased sales or margins or otherwise adversely affect our business. The enactment of new or increased import duties on raw materials imported by us could also increase the costs to us of obtaining the raw materials and might adversely affect our business.\nOur business is affected by federal rules, regulations and orders applicable to government contractors.\nA number of our products are manufactured and sold under U.S. government contracts or subcontracts. Consequently, we are directly and indirectly subject to various federal rules, regulations and orders applicable to government contractors. From time to time, we are also subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in\ngovernment programs. These inquiries and investigations are costly and consuming of internal resources. Violation of applicable government rules and regulations could result in civil liability, in cancellation or suspension of existing contracts or in ineligibility for future contracts or subcontracts funded in whole or in part with federal funds, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to environmental regulations and related liabilities and liabilities associated with chemicals and substances in the workplace.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of environmental permits required for our operations. Failure to comply with these laws or permits could result in fines and penalties, interruption of manufacturing operations or the need to install pollution control equipment that could be costly. We also may be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis. We also own properties, or conduct or have conducted operations at properties, where hazardous materials have been used for many years, including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary. Consequently, we will continue to be subject to environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances.\nOur financial statements include estimated liabilities for future costs arising from environmental issues relating to our properties and operations. Our accruals for known environmental liabilities represent our best estimate of our probable future obligations for the investigation and remediation of known contaminated sites. Our accruals include asserted and unasserted claims. The estimates of our environmental costs are based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology and take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data available for each site and the professional judgment of our environmental specialists and consultants. Although recorded liabilities include our best estimate of all probable costs, our total costs for the final settlement of each site cannot be predicted with certainty due to the variety of factors that make potential costs associated with contaminated sites inherently uncertain, such as the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent to which remedial actions will be required, the time period over which costs will be incurred, the number and economic viability of other responsible parties and whether we have any opportunity of contribution from third parties, including recovery from insurance policies. In addition, sites that are in the early stages of investigation are subject to greater uncertainties than mature sites that are close to completion. Although the sites we identify vary across the spectrum, a majority of our sites could be considered at an early stage of the investigation and remediation process. Therefore, our cost estimates and the accruals associated with those sites are subject to greater uncertainties. Environmental contingent liabilities are often resolved over a long period of time, and the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site. We expect that we will expend present accruals over many years, and that remediation of all currently known sites will be completed within an estimated 41 years. We cannot ensure that our estimated liabilities are adequate to cover the total cost of remedial measures that may eventually be required by environmental authorities with respect to known environmental matters or the cost of claims that may be asserted in the future with respect to environmental matters about which we are not yet aware. Accordingly, the costs of environmental remediation or claims may exceed the amounts accrued.\nWe have been named as a PRP at sites identified by the EPA and state regulatory agencies for investigation and remediation under CERCLA and similar state statutes. In the environmental remediation context, potentially responsible parties may be subject to an allocation process to determine liability, and therefore we may be potentially liable to the government or third parties for an allocated portion or full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated a PRP. In estimating our current liabilities for environmental matters, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may also be liable. It is also possible that we will be designated a PRP at additional sites in the future.\nLike many other industrial companies in recent years, we are defendants in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to chemicals and substances in the workplace, including asbestos. To date, we have been dismissed from a number of these suits and have settled a number of others. The outcome of litigation such as this is difficult to predict, and a judicial decision unfavorable to us could be rendered, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with international operations.\nWe purchase products from and supply products to businesses located outside of the U.S. We also have significant operations located outside the U.S. In fiscal 2015, approximately 17 percent of our total sales were attributable to our non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in U.S. dollar value arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of certain foreign currency subsidiary balances;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we or our customers operate;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade policies;\n\u2022\ntariff regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining export and import licenses;\n\u2022\nthe risk of government financed competition; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of international laws as well as U.S. and other laws affecting the activities of companies abroad.\nA majority of our sales of extruded pipe for the power generation market have been exported to power generation customers in China. These sales are subject to the risks associated with international sales generally. In addition, changes in demand could result from a reduction of power plant build rates in China due to economic conditions or otherwise, or increased competition from local manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers, or effects of anti-dumping or other import duties. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese market participants such as us are rapidly changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny lower-than-expected rating of our bank debt and debt securities could adversely affect our business.\nTwo rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, rate our debt securities. If the rating agencies were to reduce their current ratings, our interest expense may increase, our access to short-term commercial paper markets may be restricted, and the terms of future borrowing arrangements may become more stringent or require additional credit support. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control. If we breach any of these covenants, one or more events of default, including cross-defaults between multiple components of our indebtedness, could result. These events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owing to be immediately due and payable and terminate any commitments to make further extensions of credit, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur production may be interrupted due to equipment failures or other events affecting our factories.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment, such as some of our forging presses for which there may be only limited or no production alternatives. Unexpected failures of this equipment could result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs. In addition, our factories rely on the availability of electrical power and natural gas, transportation for raw materials and finished products and employee access to our workplace that are subject to interruption in the event of severe weather conditions or other natural or manmade events. While we maintain backup resources to the extent practicable, a severe or prolonged equipment outage or other interruptive event affecting areas where we have significant manufacturing operations may result in loss of manufacturing or shipping days, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Natural or manmade events that interrupt significant manufacturing operations of our customers also could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a combination of confidentiality, invention assignment and other types of agreements and trade secret, trademark, and patent law to establish, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. Our efforts in regard to these measures may be inadequate, however, to prevent others from misappropriating our intellectual property rights. In addition, laws in some non-U.S. countries affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be faced with labor shortages, disruptions or stoppages if our relations with our employees were to deteriorate.\nOur operations rely heavily on our skilled employees. Any labor shortage, disruption or stoppage caused by any deterioration in employee relations or difficulties in the renegotiation of labor contracts could reduce our operating margins and income. Approximately 22 percent of our employees are affiliated with unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. Failure to negotiate a new labor agreement when required could result in a work stoppage. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory, it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions, or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future, any of which could reduce our operating margins and income and place us at a disadvantage relative to non-union competitors.\nCybersecurity threats could disrupt our business and result in the loss of critical and confidential information.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our confidential and proprietary information. Although we maintain information security policies and procedures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct liability and contractual liability risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe produce many critical parts for commercial and military aircraft, for high-pressure applications in power plants and for oil and gas applications. Failure of our parts could give rise to substantial product liability claims. We maintain insurance addressing the risk of product liability claims arising from bodily injury or property damage (which generally does not include damages for pollution or environmental liability), but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. We manufacture most of our parts to strict contractually-established standards, tolerances and delivery schedules using complex manufacturing processes. If we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a product we may be subject to contractual liability costs and claims. Contractual liability costs are generally not insured.\nOur inventories could be subject to significant valuation changes due to our use of the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory valuation method.\nThe cost for the majority of our inventories is determined on a LIFO basis. Under the LIFO valuation method for inventories, changes in the cost inputs to produce inventories, including raw materials, labor and fixed costs, are recognized in cost of goods sold in the current period. Accordingly, the carrying value of our LIFO inventories may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory. When LIFO cost is greater than current cost, there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write-downs to market value. As of March 29, 2015, the LIFO cost of our inventories exceeds the current cost by $679 million. The key drivers that are causing our LIFO costs to exceed current costs are discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading of \u201cCritical accounting policies\u201d and the sub-heading \u201cValuation of inventories.\u201d If actual demand is significantly less than the future demand that we have projected, inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our inventories and reported operating results.\nWe could be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and pension investments.\nOur estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and assumptions relating to the employee workforce including salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality. Our results of operations, liquidity or shareholders' equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liabilities or changes in employee workforce assumptions. We may have to contribute more cash to various pension plans and record higher pension-related expenses in future periods as a result of decreases in the value of investments held by these plans or changes in discount rates or other pension assumptions.\nA global recession or disruption in global financial markets could adversely affect us.\nA global recession or disruption in the global financial markets presents risks and uncertainties that we cannot predict. During the recent recession, we saw a moderate decline in demand for our products due to global economic conditions. However, our access to credit to finance our operations was not materially limited. If recessionary economic conditions or financial market disruptions were to return, we would face risks that may include:\n\u2022\ndeclines in revenues and profitability from reduced or delayed orders by our customers;\n\u2022\nsupply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources;\n\u2022\nreductions to our banking group or to our committed credit availability due to combinations or failures of financial institutions; and\n\u2022\nincreases in corporate tax rates to finance government spending programs.", "PERMNO": 63830, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "PCP"}
