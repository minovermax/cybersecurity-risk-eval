{"cik": "14930", "company": "BRUNSWICK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company's operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nWorldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.\nIn times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects our financial performance. Although we have expanded the portions of our portfolio that are dependent or substantially weighted toward the usage and maintenance of boats and engines versus the sale of new product and therefore less susceptible to economic cycles, a portion of the business remains cyclical and sensitive to personal spending levels.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are used for recreation, and consumers\u2019 limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreation, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the timing or continued strength of global economies, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.\nFailure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, making acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. However, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant capital investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.\nSuccessfully managing our manufacturing activity is critical to our operating and financial results.\nOver the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida. We may also make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We have also implemented, or are in the process of implementing, several manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any manufacturing consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.\nMoving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws and policies governing foreign trade could continue to adversely affect our business. As a result of recent policy changes, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted\nor are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, such as aluminum and steel. Although we were granted exclusion from Section 301 tariffs for Mercury Marine 40, 50, and 60 horsepower engines in 2018 effective through the end of 2019, these exclusions were not renewed for 2020 and the denial of exemption requests will negatively affect our business. We continue to be subject to meaningful other tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted similar exclusions for these or other products in the future, or that we will not be subject to additional tariffs. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.\nSome of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines manufactured in China and purchased from our joint venture in Japan. We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.\nWe sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.\nOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.\nWe believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, and Lund significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name \u201cBrunswick,\u201d to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.\nFiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.\nFiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, there are fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, as well as greater down payment requirements than before the global recession. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.\nDealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.\nOur dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers. Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company\u2019s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers.\nMany factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including:\n\u2022\ntheir ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe performance of their overall credit portfolios;\n\u2022\ntheir willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers;\n\u2022\nthe overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and\n\u2022\nthe overall aging and level of pipeline inventories.\nOur sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.\nWe rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAlthough at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers\u2019 financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines.\nAdverse economic, credit, and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives.\nAdverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. This could adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and competitive position.\nIn addition, our variable rate indebtedness and financing programs, including wholesale financing arrangements through BAC, may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. As announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings.\nAdverse weather conditions, climate events, or regulatory policies can have a negative effect on revenues.\nChanges in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products.\nCatastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.\nHurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales\nmarkets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.\nLoss of key customers could harm our business.\nIn each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, such as White River Marine Group, LLC and MarineMax, Inc., and, from time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup.\nOur business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.\nThe talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. Although we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully, we perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions.\nIn 2019, we reorganized several of our operations and streamlined functions as part of the transformation to a marine-focused enterprise. Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of these organizational changes or other, currently unanticipated executive or management changes that may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMuch of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but with unemployment rates at low levels in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods, availability of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting and training programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.\nWe intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, and dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the novel coronavirus. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.\nInstability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.\nIn addition, global political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.\nAdditionally, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) officially withdrew from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d), subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, which could be extended up to two years under certain conditions (the \u201cBrexit Transition Period\u201d). There is uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU after the Brexit Transition Period. This uncertainty could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility, legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.\nWe also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $580 million, which represents approximately 16 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.\nOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.\nWe manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. In addition, the Fitness business sale has required the separation of previously unified business and IT systems, and new systems, which process is ongoing. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We are working to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. If a legacy system or another of the Company's key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.\nWe exchange information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems. A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, random attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks. We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company, and damage our image and reputation.\nWe rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nCertain of our business system reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and operate our business.\nWe collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective January 1, 2020. Although we have implemented plans to comply with the laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future law and regulations could impose an even greater compliance burden and risk with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information.\nInventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products. Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain of our products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.\nWe may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.\nWe have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.\nOur maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.\nOur inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products. In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.\nDeclines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to tariff impacts or defects or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.\nWe rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.\nIn addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.\nSome additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include:\n\u2022\nfinancial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets;\n\u2022\na deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;\n\u2022\nevents such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes;\n\u2022\nan outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the existing threat of coronavirus, particularly as it may impact our operations and supply chain in China;\n\u2022\nsupplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or\n\u2022\nlabor disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs.\nThese risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.\nWe continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials, such as aluminum, in 2019. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.\nHigher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.\nHigher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.\nEither inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, or failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;\n\u2022\nthird parties may independently develop similar technology;\n\u2022\nagreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;\n\u2022\nwe may not have adequate remedies for breaches;\n\u2022\nexisting patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;\n\u2022\na third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or\n\u2022\nwe may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention.\nIn addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. In addition to defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.\nWe have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability in a declining sales environment.\nThe fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base during the economic recovery, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially impacting our results.\nAn inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.\nOur growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies, and cost savings, and our ability to make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.\nAs part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses. Recent results of this evaluation include the sale of the Fitness business, the discontinuation of Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht models, and winding down yacht production. We have previously and may in the future make other changes to our portfolio as well, which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe completed Fitness business separation could be disruptive to the business and our operations, and there can be no assurance that it will provide all of the anticipated business benefits.\nOn June 27, 2019, the Company completed the sale (Sale) of the Fitness business to KPS Capital Partners, LP (KPS), which Sale included a transition services arrangement. Like any business separation, the Sale involves risks, including difficulties associated with the separation of operations, services, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, the potential loss of key employees, and adverse effects on relationships with business partners. In addition, we have incurred, and continue to incur, expenses in connection with the separation, and the completion of the transition services arrangement requires time and effort by the Company\u2019s management team, which may divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Also, in connection with the Sale, we agreed to indemnify KPS for certain specified matters, including product liability and regulatory matters. If we do not successfully manage these risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected. Furthermore, the Sale may not achieve the intended results, or results may take longer to realize than expected. The anticipated benefits of the Sale are based on a number of factors that we cannot predict.\nThe inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, including the Global Marine & Mobile Business of Power Products, could negatively impact financial results.\nOn August 9, 2018, Brunswick acquired the Global Marine & Mobile business of Power Products, which includes the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses. Additionally, on May 21, 2019, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of Freedom Boat Club, a leading boat club operator based in Florida. Acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. The Power Products and Freedom Boat Club acquisitions and other, future acquisitions, present these and other integration risks, including:\n\u2022\ndisruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period;\n\u2022\nthe risk that unexpected costs will be incurred;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties retaining employees.\nIf we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses, including Power Products and Freedom Boat Club, into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results.\nThe franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.\nOur franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees.\nWhile our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company\u2019s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2019, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2020 and beyond. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:\n\u2022\nunfavorable market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of cash.\nDelaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.\nThe introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.\nIn addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick\u2019s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet customer expectations.\nWe believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.\nWe manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.\nOur manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.\nCompliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, privacy, and other regulations. While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.\nEnvironmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating and marinas, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.\nOur manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.\nChanges in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nAlthough domestic tax reform legislation in the form of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, has had an overall positive impact on our financial statements, the impact of the legislation could change as we analyze and apply additional regulations or guidance issued by the government. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including the reaction by states to the corporate tax changes in the TCJA, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow, and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. tax law will likely have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, consumer behavior, and/or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the Company and our results.\nCertain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management\u2019s and our Board\u2019s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSome of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.\nWe share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results.", "PERMNO": 10874, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "BC"}
