Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our common stock. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to raise capital and growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to raise capital and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe are substantially dependent on the market acceptance in the United States for Algovita, and the failure of Algovita to gain market acceptance would negatively impact our business.\nOn November 30, 2015, Integer announced receipt of premarket approval for Algovita, and we launched Algovita commercially in the United States during the first half of 2016. If we are unable to achieve significant market acceptance in the United States, our results of operations will be adversely affected as the United States is expected to be the principal market for Algovita. We currently have Virtis and other complete medical devices incorporating our neurostimulation technology platform in development; however, if we are unsuccessful in commercializing Algovita, unable to market Algovita as a result of a quality problem, fail to maintain regulatory approval for Algovita, or experience unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects related to Algovita, we would lose our expected main source of revenue, and our business will be adversely affected. Virtis and other extensions of our technology platform could be adversely affected as well.\nIf we fail to develop and retain an effective direct sales force in the United States, our business could suffer.\nTo commercialize Algovita in the United States, we must build and retain a substantial direct sales force. As we expand our commercial launch of Algovita in the United States and concurrently increase our marketing efforts, we will need to retain, grow and develop our direct sales representatives. There is significant competition for sales representatives experienced in medical device sales. Once hired, the training process is lengthy because it requires significant education for new sales representatives to achieve the level of clinical competency with Algovita expected by physicians. Upon completion of the training, sales representatives typically require lead-time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales representatives, and if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our financial performance will suffer. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitors, we may have to wait until applicable non-competition provisions have expired before deploying that personnel in restricted territories or incur costs to relocate personnel outside of those territories, and we may be subject to future allegations that these new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information of their former employers. Any of these risks may adversely affect our business.\nWe must demonstrate to physicians the merits of Algovita compared to products marketed by our competitors.\nPhysicians play a significant role in determining the course of a patient\u2019s treatment and, as a result, the type of product that will be used to treat a patient. As a result, our success depends, in large part, on effectively marketing Algovita and SCS therapy to physicians. To successfully commercialize Algovita, we must successfully demonstrate to physicians the merits of Algovita as compared to our competitors\u2019 SCS systems. Acceptance of Algovita depends, in part, on educating physicians as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness of Algovita compared to our competitors\u2019 SCS systems, and communicating to physicians the proper application of Algovita. If we are not successful in convincing physicians of the merits of Algovita or educating them on the use of Algovita, they may not use our products and we may be unable to increase our sales, sustain our growth or achieve profitability.\nAdditionally, an important part of our sales process also includes the education of physicians on the safe and effective use of Algovita. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to educate physicians on the proper use of Algovita, and to provide them with adequate product support during clinical procedures. If physicians misuse or ineffectively use our products, it could result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injuries, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Finally, in the United States, for physicians to use Algovita, we expect that the hospital facilities where these physicians treat patients typically will require us to enter into purchasing contracts with them. If we do not receive access to hospital facilities via these contracting processes or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure contracts or tender successful bids, our sales and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe seasonality of our business creates variance in our quarterly revenue, which makes it difficult to compare or forecast our financial results.\nOur revenue fluctuates on a seasonal basis, which affects the comparability of our results between periods. We have experienced lower sales in the first quarter and third quarter of the year, which we believe is due to weather-related events, holidays, the buying patterns and implant volumes of our distributors, hospitals and clinics and reimbursement related issues such as patient deductibles. These seasonal variations are difficult to predict accurately, may vary amongst different markets and regions, and at times may be entirely unpredictable. This may create additional risk to our business as we rely upon forecasts of customer demand to build inventory in advance of anticipated sales. In addition, we believe our limited history commercializing our products has, in part, made our seasonal patterns more difficult to determine, making it more difficult to predict future seasonal patterns.\nOur competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources than us and many have a long history of competing in the SCS market.\nOur current and potential competitors are publicly-traded, or are divisions of publicly-traded, major medical device companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, and Nevro Corp., each has an approved neuromodulation system in at least the United States, Europe, and Australia. Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories have each been established for several years while Nevro is a new entrant to the SCS market and is marketing its High Frequency 10 (HF10) SCS therapy for treatment of several chronic pain conditions. We expect that as we continue to sell Algovita commercially in the United States, our competitors will take aggressive action to protect their current market share and position. We expect to face significant competition in establishing our market share in the United States and may encounter currently unforeseen obstacles and competitive challenges.\nIn addition, we face a particular challenge in overcoming entrenched practices by some physicians who exclusively use the neurostimulation products produced by our larger, more established competitors. Physicians who have completed many successful procedures using neurostimulation products made by these competitors may be reluctant or unwilling to try a new product from a new entrant in the marketplace with which they are less familiar. If these physicians are unwilling to try or adopt Algovita, our business will be adversely affected.\nFurther, a number of our competitors are currently conducting, or we anticipate will be conducting, clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of their SCS systems, which may lead to regulatory approvals for use of their systems for additional indications or support for their marketing claims that their products are superior to Algovita. Competition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their product offerings to compete directly with Algovita or other companies enter the SCS market. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization, or produce clinical results that show greater efficacy than Algovita, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices for Algovita due to increased competition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively affected.\nWe may never achieve full market acceptance in Europe.\nAlgovita received CE mark approval in June 2014, enabling us to commercialize it in Europe. We currently sell Algovita in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United Kingdom. We have limited experience engaging in commercial activities and limited established relationships with physicians and hospitals in those countries. We may be unable to gain broader market acceptance in these countries, which will adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe are dependent upon sole-source manufacturers and suppliers, including Integer and Minnetronix, making us vulnerable to supply shortages, manufacturing problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Integer under which we purchase fully assembled Algovita systems and most products, parts and components necessary for the production of Algovita. We also entered into a product component framework agreement that provides Integer with the exclusive right to supply us with products, parts and components necessary for production of future SNM or DBS neurostimulation devices that we may seek to commercialize. Subject to conditions specified in these agreements, Integer is our exclusive and sole source manufacturer and supplier for most products, parts and components of Algovita, while Minnetronix is the sole-source supplier of our external peripheral devices.\nEffective December 9, 2016, we entered into a manufacturing and supply amendment with Minnetronix for the supply of our current platform of external peripheral devices used with our Algovita spinal cord stimulation system, including the clinician programmer, patient programmer, the patient charging paddle, the external pulse generator kit and the patient feedback tool. Minnetronix is our sole-source supplier for these items (although we retain the right to manufacture the products ourselves).\nAs a result, we are vulnerable to supply shortages, failure to maintain adequate safety stock and manufacturing problems encountered by Integer or Minnetronix, including, for example, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, failure to properly conduct its own business affairs, and infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, any of which could delay or impede its ability to meet our requirements. Integer or Minnetronix may also be unwilling to supply components for Algovita or our other products or suffer from disruptions in their own supply chains. Even if Integer or Minnetronix were in material default under the supply agreements, as a practical matter, it would require time and investment to qualify new suppliers and comply with regulatory requirements regarding manufacture and supply. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of price fluctuations or competitive pricing that may become available from alternative supply sources. Our reliance on each of Integer and Minnetronix as our sole source suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nwe are not the only customer of either supplier, and they may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours;\n\u2022\nin the event our supply agreement or relationship is terminated, we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\nin the event our supply agreement or relationship is terminated, switching suppliers would likely require product redesign and submission to FDA, or other foreign regulatory bodies, which would significantly impede or delay our commercial activities or even suspend them;\n\u2022\nInteger or Minnetronix, which are dependent upon certain sole-source suppliers themselves, could suffer from shortages or delays in their supply chains, which could inhibit or delay their ability to fulfill our orders and meeting our requirements; and\n\u2022\nInteger or Minnetronix could encounter other financial or business hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit cost of Algovita and improve our gross margins.\nCurrently, the gross profit generated from the sale of Algovita is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses. To achieve profitability, we need to, among other things, reduce the per unit cost for Algovita and improve our gross margins. This cannot be achieved without increasing the volume of systems and components that we purchase from Integer and Minnetronix. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of any factor that negatively impacts the sales of Algovita or reduces manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our desired reduction in per unit costs and increase in gross margins, which would negatively affect our operating results and may prevent us from attaining profitability.\nOur international operations subject us to certain operating risks, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2014, following our receipt of CE mark for Algovita in June 2014, we began selling Algovita in Europe through a limited number of distributors. We began our sales in Germany and, to date, have expanded our sales efforts into Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Given that we do not have, or currently plan to use, any direct sales representatives in Europe, we are heavily dependent on the efforts of a limited number of distributors in Europe. The sale and shipment of Algovita and our other products across international borders exposes us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and in defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us, our distributors, or our suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nshortages in high-quality sales representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\ncompetitive disadvantage to competition with established business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nimposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\neconomic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non- tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nimposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements; and\n\u2022\nimposition of new trade restrictions.\nIn addition, our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, import-export, laws regarding transactions in foreign countries, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and local anti-bribery and other laws regarding interactions with healthcare professionals. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases prohibit, United States companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices in foreign countries. Our failure to comply with these regulations and laws could subject us to penalties, fines, denial of export privileges, seizures of shipments, product recalls, restrictions on business activities or other criminal, civil or administrative actions.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.\nIssues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, including product recalls and product liability litigation, and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to Algovita or any of our other products at any stage. A quality or safety issue, including a product recall, may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly product liability and other litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue, including a product recall, in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a diversion of management attention, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.\nWe may not be able to establish or strengthen our brand.\nWe believe that establishing and strengthening our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance for Algovita and our other products, particularly because of the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate. Promoting and positioning our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and the perception by physicians and our other customers of the quality and efficacy of Algovita and our other products.\nGiven the established nature of our competitors, it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur significant expenses. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased sales and, even if they do yield increased sales, any sales increases may not offset the expenses we incurred to promote our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, Algovita and our other products may not be accepted by physicians and our others customers, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our senior management or fail to hire necessary personnel and sales representatives.\nWe are dependent upon the continued services of key members of our senior management. The loss of these individuals could disrupt our operations or our strategic plans. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to hire or contract with, and retain, the necessary qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel and sales representatives, for whom we compete with numerous other companies, academic institutions and organizations. The loss of members of our management team or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Algovita and other neurostimulation devices we market for sale, we may be required to decrease our selling prices, which could have a negative effect on our financial performance.\nOur success in marketing Algovita and any other neurostimulation devices we develop depends and will depend in large part on whether United States and international government health administrative authorities, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of Algovita and those other devices. Third-party payers continually review their coverage and reimbursement policies and could, without notice, eliminate or reduce coverage or reimbursement for SCS, SNM or DBS therapy and/or Algovita and any other devices we develop.\nFurther, the trends toward managed care, healthcare cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants will continue to intensify, which will result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for SCS, SNM or DBS therapy and, in particular, for Algovita by third-party payers is essential to the acceptance of Algovita.\nIn addition, reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, in some cases, by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals are often required to be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for Algovita and other SCS devices in our international markets, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nWe have a relatively short operating history. We intend to continue to grow and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion, which could place a significant additional strain on our limited personnel, information technology systems and other resources. In particular, the hiring and retention of our direct sales representatives in the United States requires significant management, financial and other supporting resources. In order to manage our operations and growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting systems and control procedures, which we may be unable to do in a cost efficient manner or at all. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we continue to develop or seek to develop additional products using our neurostimulation technology platform for commercial introduction, we may be substantially dependent on sales from Algovita for many years. Over the longer term, we will need to successfully introduce new products or advancements to Algovita in order to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of its competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.\nU.S. or European regulatory authorities may not approve the regulatory submission of Virtis, our SNM System.\nWe submitted Virtis to the FDA and to the CE mark authorities in Europe for the treatment of chronic urinary retention and the symptoms of overactive bladder in January 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The approval of these submissions may be delayed or rejected, or the authorities may require us to submit additional information for approval. In the event the submissions are not approved in either the U.S. or Europe, our market release of Virtis would be substantially delayed or may never occur, which could adversely impact our future revenues and our ability to effectively compete. If we are required to provide additional information to either authority, we may be required to increase spending for related research and development or clinical projects, which could adversely impact our profitability and require additional resources or personnel.\nIf clinical studies for future indications do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize our products for these indications.\nWe will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies and post marketing studies in the future to support approval for new indications and product claims. Clinical testing takes many years, is expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, institutional review boards or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol, force us to modify a previously approved protocol, or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\npatients do not enroll in, or enroll at a lower rate than we expect, or do not complete a clinical study;\n\u2022\npatients or investigators do not comply with study protocols;\n\u2022\npatients do not return for post-treatment follow-up at the expected rate;\n\u2022\npatients experience serious or unexpected adverse side effects for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our products such as the advanced stage of two chronic diseases or conditions that may exist at the time of treatment, causing a clinical study to be put on hold;\n\u2022\nsites participating in an ongoing clinical study withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays associated with establishing additional clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or perform in a manner inconsistent with the investigator agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices or other regulations governing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthird-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical studies or manufacturing facilities require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nchanges in federal, state, or foreign governmental statutes, regulations or policies;\n\u2022\ninterim results are inconclusive or unfavorable as to immediate and long-term safety or efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe study design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy; or\n\u2022\nthe statistical endpoints are not met.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our clinical studies or post marketing studies may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or non-clinical studies in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use.\nWe could also encounter delays if the FDA concludes that our financial relationships with investigators results in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site or the utility of the clinical trial itself. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash and/or stock compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to or ownership interest by the clinical investigator carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or if the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of our premarket approval application by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing any of our products currently in development.\nOur future success is highly dependent upon our use of our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, which rights could be adversely impacted by many factors, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a neuromodulation medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of our neurostimulation technology platform, we expect to be highly dependent upon our use of our intellectual property rights. These intellectual property rights could be adversely impacted by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nWe may in the future become involved in lawsuits to defend ourselves against intellectual property disputes, which could be expensive and time consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful, and could result in the diversion of significant resources, and hinder our ability to commercialize our existing or future products;\n\u2022\nOur patents and other intellectual property rights infringing or violating the proprietary rights of others, particularly given that our competitors have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies and may have applied for or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that may interfere with our ability to sell our products. For example, should a third party bring a claim against us, our customers, our suppliers or our distributors, whether merited or not, it could be costly to defend, require us to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers, or distributors, interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, and/or export our products or require us to obtain a license (which we may not be able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all);\n\u2022\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide sufficient commercial protection for Algovita and any future complete medical device that incorporates our neurostimulation technology platform, and potentially enable third parties to use our technology or very similar technology and reduce our ability to compete in the market;\n\u2022\nThird parties may seek to challenge our patents, and, as a result, these patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable;\n\u2022\nOur current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022\nPatent reform legislation, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or any future patent reform legislation may affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, affect patent litigation or switch the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, any or all of which could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents;\n\u2022\nIf we may fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering Algovita and our neurostimulation technology platform, whether through unintentional lapse or otherwise, a competitor could design, manufacture and market products that are the same or similar to our own;\n\u2022\nWe may become involved in interference or derivation proceedings or re-examination or opposition proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign patent authority to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications, which if the outcome were unfavorable could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party;\n\u2022\nWe rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position, which we endeavor to protect through non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to these items; provided, however, despite our best efforts and contractual limitations, our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information may get disclosed and thereafter are likely to lose trade secret protection; and\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to our license agreements with Integer, including the potential for Integer to develop competing or similar products.\nWe have licensed to Integer the right to use (i) specified non-core intellectual property underlying our neurostimulation technology platform for applications within the neurostimulation fields of use in the unrestricted license agreement and (ii) other specified intellectual property underlying our neurostimulation technology platform for applications outside of the neurostimulation fields of use in the restricted license agreement. In addition, NeuroNexus has licensed to Integer the right to use its intellectual property outside of the neurostimulation fields of use. Integer, through the use of this licensed intellectual property or through the use of other intellectual property that it separately owns or has developed, may seek to develop products, components or improvements to items that compete against or are similar to our own products and components. In addition, if Integer tries to develop a product that incorporates licensed intellectual property for applications within a prohibited field of use, we may seek to enforce the terms of the license agreements to prohibit these developments, which could subject us to costly litigation, distract management and negatively affect our supply agreements with Integer. In addition, pursuant to the terms of these license agreements, we will be required to indemnify Integer against third party infringement claims, which could result in our incurrence of significant expenses to defend any such matters or require us to make significant indemnification payments to Integer.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our products could subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use, and expect to continue to use, some open source software in our products. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Further, if the license terms for the open source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our products, resulting in additional costs.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities.\nWe do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build brand recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build brand recognition in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties have registered trademarks similar to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions and may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we were not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries. In any case, if we are unable to establish brand recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of significant net operating losses. If we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our financial condition could suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net operating losses, and we expect to continue to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses as we continue to build our direct sales force in the United States, expand commercial sales of Algovita in the United States in 2018, continue to pursue regulatory approvals for Virtis, and assuming approval, begin to build a sales force for Virtis.\nWe intend to continue to increase our operating expenses substantially as we add sales representatives and independent sales agents in the United States and a network of distributors and independent sales agents outside of the United States to increase our geographic sales coverage and penetration, invest in research and development programs to accelerate new product launches, expand our marketing and training programs, conduct clinical studies, and increase our general and administrative functions as a result of operating as an independent publicly-traded company. We may not ever generate sufficient sales from our operations to achieve profitability, and even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to remain profitable for any substantial period of time. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our financial condition will suffer.\nWe will be required to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we anticipate our expenses will increase as we continue to build a direct sales force in the United States, develop the use of our neurostimulation technology platform for the treatment of other conditions, and continue to grow our business. Our existing resources, inclusive of the cash capital contribution of $75.0 million made by Integer immediately prior to the completion of the spin-off, borrowings under our credit facility, as amended (the availability of which is subject to compliance with specified conditions and covenants), and net proceeds from our follow-on common stock offering, may not allow us to conduct all of the activities that we believe would be beneficial for our future growth. As a result, we may need to seek additional funds in the future. If we are unable to raise additional funds on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to support our commercialization efforts for Algovita or increase our research and development activities, and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining supplementary or additional approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe scope and timing of our investment in our United States commercial infrastructure and direct sales force;\n\u2022\nthe research and development activities we intend to undertake in order to expand the indications and product enhancements that we intend to pursue;\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercialization activities including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution;\n\u2022\nthe degree and rate of market acceptance of Algovita;\n\u2022\nchanges or fluctuations in our inventory supply needs and forecasts of our supply needs;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy the conditions and covenants, including trailing six-month revenue milestones to be able to draw upon our $45 million of term loan financing under our credit facility;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire additional personnel to support our operations as an independent publicly-traded company; and\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.\nTo finance these activities, we may seek additional funds through borrowings or rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings, and strategic partnerships. We may be unable to raise necessary funds on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we borrow funds or issue debt securities, these securities will have payment rights superior to holders of our common stock and may contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We may have to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates, or products that we otherwise may not wish to relinquish.\nOur credit facility contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank and borrowed $15.0 million under the facility. In February 2017, the credit facility was amended to extend the availability of the final two tranches of the facility. In September 2017 we drew down an additional $12.5 million under the facility. In February 2018, our credit facility was amended again to extend the amortization period and maturity date and to replace the $5 million revolving line commitment with a $5 million term loan commitment. In February 2018 we also drew down an additional $12.5 million under the facility. Our credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell, lease, transfer, assign, or dispose of any part of our business or property;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or be liable for any indebtedness other than unsecured indebtedness to trade creditors incurred in the ordinary course of business and other permitted indebtedness as defined in our credit facility;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends on, repurchasing, or making distributions with respect to our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified investments (including loans and advances);\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, we are subject to a quarterly financial covenant requiring us to achieve specified minimum consolidated product revenues. The covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to take certain actions and, in the event that we breach one or more covenants, our lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding and foreclose on the collateral granted to it under the facility.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe assess our goodwill balances for impairment on the last day of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. On December 31, 2017, we performed our annual qualitative analysis goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual analysis, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Refer to Our Critical Accounting Estimates within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding this testing.\nOn a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are required to adopt a new revenue recognition standard in 2018, and we may have difficulties adopting this standard.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which has been subsequently updated. The purpose of ASC 606 is to provide enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle requires entities to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We will adopt the provisions in ASC 606, as amended, effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective method and will only apply this method to contracts that are not completed as of the date of adoption.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, we are continuing to update and enhance our internal accounting systems and our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are not successful in updating our policies, procedures, information systems and internal controls over financial reporting, the revenue that we recognize and the related disclosures that we provide under ASC 606 may not be complete or accurate, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nThe application of the new standard will be based on all information available to us as of the date of adoption and up through subsequent interim reporting, including transition guidance published by the standard setters. However, we understand the interpretation of these new standards will continue to evolve as other public companies adopt ASC 606 and the standard setters issue new interpretive guidance related to these rules. As a result, changes in the interpretation of these rules could result in adjustments to our application of the new standard, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to maintain sufficient levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. In order to market and sell Algovita effectively, we often must maintain high levels of inventory. In particular, as we expand our commercial launch of Algovita in the United States, we intend to substantially increase our levels of inventory and our safety stock in order to meet our estimated demand and, as a result, incur significant expenditures associated with increases in our inventory and safety stock. The manufacturing process requires lengthy lead times, during which components of Algovita may become obsolete, and we may over- or under-estimate the amount needed of a given component, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the number of Algovita systems that we can produce. As compared to direct manufacturers, our dependence on Integer and Minnetronix as sole manufacturers of certain key parts and devices used in our products exposes us to greater lead times increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence. Furthermore, Algovita has a limited shelf life due to sterilization requirements, and part or all of a given product or component may expire and its value would become impaired and we would be required to record an impairment charge. If our estimates of required inventory are too high, we may be exposed to further inventory obsolesce risk. In the event we experience a supply chain imbalance, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.\nIf we increase our sales outside the Unites States, we may be subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.\nIf we increase our sales outside the Unites States, we may be subject to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, which could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period-to-period comparisons. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the reporting of our receivables and payables in non-U.S. currencies. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may engage in exchange rate-hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nGovernmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies and authorities, regulate the medical device industry extensively and oversee virtually all aspects of a medical device\u2019s development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, distribution and marketing, as well as modifications to existing products and the marketing of existing products for new indications.\nGenerally, unless an exemption applies, a medical device and modifications to a device or its indications must receive either premarket approval or premarket clearance from the FDA before it can be marketed in the United States. The approval process may involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities, extensive agency review processes, and other costly and time-consuming procedures. It may take several years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product or modification. We may not be successful in the future in receiving approvals and clearances in a timely manner or at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain, such approvals could negatively impact our marketing of any future products and reduce our product revenues.\nThe laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Legislative or regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation of our Business\u201d for additional information regarding the regulatory schemes applicable to us and our business.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. federal and state regulations or other foreign regulations applicable in the countries where we operate could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance or approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of manufacturing facilities are possible. If any of these risks materialize, our business would be adversely affected.\nAlgovita and other neurostimulation devices we develop may in the future be subject to notifications, recalls, or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical in Germany, have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. Further, under the FDA and similar foreign medical device reporting regulations, we are required to submit information to the governmental agency when we receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or injury or has or may have a malfunction that could likely cause or contribute to death or injury if the malfunction were to recur, which may prompt action by the governmental authority. A government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other issues. Recalls, which include certain notifications and corrections as well as removals, of our products could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue.\nIn addition, the manufacturing of our products is subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, and any failure by us or our suppliers, including Integer and Minnetronix, to comply with regulatory requirements could result in recalls, facility closures, and other penalties. We and our suppliers are subject to the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and comparable foreign regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, and servicing of medical devices. These regulations are enforced through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. Any manufacturing issues at our or our suppliers\u2019 facilities, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in warning or untitled letters, manufacturing restrictions, voluntary or mandatory recalls or corrections, fines, withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals, product seizures, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, which would adversely affect our business results and prospects.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion.\nAlgovita has received premarket approval from the FDA and CE mark approval for use in the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk or limbs. We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our product off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our product off-label. Furthermore, the use of our product for indications other than those approved by the applicable regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. Physicians may also misuse our product or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability litigation. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation, including product liability litigation, by our customers or their patients. In addition, if the FDA or other regulatory bodies determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it or they, as applicable, could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions that may result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other restrictions. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business.\nIn the United States, the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal False Claims Act and civil money penalties, including whistleblower and qui tam actions;\n\u2022\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act;\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers (known as the physician \u201csunshine\u201d requirements), which requirements have been recently expanded under the Patient Protection and ACA;\n\u2022\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery laws; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws.\nSee \u201cBusiness - Regulation of our Business\u201d for a detailed description of each of these laws and their impact on our operations. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which includes, among other things, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions. As a consequence of passage of the TCJA, this excise tax has been suspended through December 31, 2019, but if this suspension is not continued or made permanent thereafter, the excise tax will be reinstated starting on January 1, 2020 and would result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry. If any efforts we undertake to offset the excise tax in the future are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and payment system reforms and shared savings pilots and other provisions, may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect our business. The full impact of the ACA, its possible repeal or replacement and the impact of other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burden and operating costs.\nAdditional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained and the trading price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as:\n\u2022\nresults from, or any delays in, clinical trial programs relating to our product candidates, including any additional planned clinical trials for Algovita or Virtis;\n\u2022\nour reliance on each of Integer, our exclusive and sole manufacturer and supplier of parts and components for Algovita, and Minnetronix, our sole-source supplier of external peripheral devices;\n\u2022\nany supply shortages or delays, manufacturing problems or price fluctuations related to Algovita or its components that could impact our inventory supply and inhibit our ability to meet demand as we expand our business;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nrecalls of our products;\n\u2022\nour operating results;\n\u2022\nour cash-on-hand and overall liquidity;\n\u2022\ndilution of our common stock resulting from the issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into additional shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to Algovita and our other products;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain regulatory approval for Virtis in the United States or Europe;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or develop additional products;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the medical device industry in general;\n\u2022\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022\nFDA or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry or other healthcare reform measures in the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ngeneral changes or uncertainty in the political, regulatory, safety or economic conditions in the United States or Europe, including as a result of the change in the United States presidential administration or the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the United States equity markets; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key scientific personnel or executive officers.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for equity securities of medical device companies in particular, have experienced volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If analysts that choose to cover us downgrade our stock or issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of these analysts, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our trading volume to decline and, as a result, our stock price may become more volatile and could decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of some of the exemptions from the reporting requirements that are afforded to emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may become more volatile. We may continue to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any independent publicly-traded company, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including incentive equity awards that we have granted, and expect to continue to grant, to our directors, officers and employees. Our stockholders experienced dilution in connection with our follow-on common stock offering completed in February 2018. In addition, under our credit facility, we have issued, and expect to issue, warrants to the lenders to purchase a number of shares of our common stock with a notional value equal to 4.5% of the funded amount of such term loan tranches, with all warrants issued at the time of a tranche funding having an exercise price equal to the lower of the average closing price of our common stock for the ten previous days of trading or the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to such tranche funding. Each warrant is exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance. If we issue common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into common stock, including the warrants issued to our lenders, our stockholders would experience dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nChanges in tax law may affect the U.S. federal tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law resulting in significant changes to United States federal income taxation law, including changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations, including us, and changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of stockholders in U.S. corporations, including investors in our common stock. The Treasury Department is expected to, but has not yet, issued regulations and other guidance regarding this new legislation. We are currently unable to predict what guidance will be issued with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, whether any further changes to United States federal income taxation law will occur or the impact of any of the foregoing, including on the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs an independent publicly-traded company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in our internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our internal control over financial reporting, to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or, when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are then-listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and under Delaware law may discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and could lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquirer or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors.\nThe provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all shares of capital stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to remove a director for cause, and the prohibition on removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to alter our by-laws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all shares of capital stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of our by-laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, Chairman of our Board of Directors or our Chief Executive Officer, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors for cause; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by-laws and individual indemnity agreements with our officers and directors provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, and, to the extent authorized from time to time by our Board of Directors, our other employees and agents, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, subject to specified exceptions. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.", "PERMNO": 15955, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NVTRQ"}
