{"cik": "1282977", "company": "GREENHILL & CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur future growth is dependent on both our ability to identify, attract and hire additional managing directors and other professionals and our ability to identify, acquire and successfully integrate complementary advisory businesses\nThe future growth of our business is dependent upon our ability to recruit new personnel, develop our existing and new personnel and expand through strategic investments or acquisitions. To successfully increase our headcount we must identify, attract and hire professionals, or teams of professionals, to join our firm, who not only will be able to function as trusted advisors to our clients without the support of a large suite of products but also will be able to fit into our collegial culture. The recruitment, development and training of professionals require large commitments of time and resources. It may take a substantial amount of time to determine whether new professionals will be effective and, during that time, we may incur significant expenses on compensation, integration and business development activities. Furthermore, there can be no certainty that our personnel will develop the skills necessary to advise our client base or that we will be able to retain the high achieving personnel.\nIn the event we grow by strategic investment or acquisition, we face numerous risks and uncertainties similar to those of hiring and developing internally our individual professionals. We also face the challenge of integrating a large number of personnel into our global organization and ensuring a good cultural fit. Management and other existing personnel will spend considerable time and resources working to integrate the acquired business, which may distract them from other business operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully attract, hire and train new and existing professionals or make strategic investments and integrate the personnel into our business and retain them, our financial results could suffer.\nOur ability to retain our managing directors and other professionals is critical to the success of our business\nThe success of our business depends upon the personal reputation, judgment, integrity, business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our managing directors. Our managing directors\u2019 personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements. Accordingly, the retention of our managing directors, who are not obligated to remain employed with us, is particularly crucial to our future success. Managing directors have left Greenhill in the past and others may do so in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that the departure of any managing director would have on our business. The departure or other loss of a number of our managing directors could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and successfully complete engagements, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if any of our managing directors were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services, or some of our managing directors or other professionals could choose to follow the departing managing director in joining an existing competitor or forming a competing company. Although we have entered into non-competition agreements with our managing directors, the restriction period in many of the agreements does not exceed three to six months, and there is no guarantee that these agreements are sufficiently broad or effective to prevent our managing directors from resigning to join our competitors or that the non-competition agreements would be upheld if we were to seek to enforce our rights under these agreements. Further, certain states in which\nwe operate, such as California, have laws that limit the enforceability of non-compete agreements. If additional states adopt similar regulation, it may further limit our ability to prevent our managing directors from joining our competitors.\nPrincipally all of our revenues are derived from advisory fees, which results in volatility in our revenues and profits\nWe are entirely focused on the financial advisory business and we earn principally all of our revenues from advisory fees paid to us by each of our clients, in large part upon the successful completion of the client\u2019s transaction, the timing of which is outside of our control. Unlike diversified investment banks, which generate revenues from commercial lending, securities trading and underwriting, or other advisory firms, which have asset management and other businesses, our generation of revenues from sources other than advisory fees is minimal. As a result, a decline in our advisory engagements, the number and scale of successfully completed client transactions or the market for advisory services generally would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur engagements are singular in nature and do not provide for subsequent engagements, which could cause our revenues to fluctuate materially from period to period\nWe operate in a highly-competitive environment where our clients generally retain us on a non-exclusive, short-term, engagement-by-engagement basis in connection with specific transactions or projects, rather than under long-term contracts covering potential additional future services. As these transactions and projects are singular in nature and subject to intense competition, we must seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated. As a result, high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in the next-succeeding period or any future period. In addition, we generally derive most of our engagement revenues at key transaction milestones, such as announcement or closing, and the timing of these milestones is outside our control. Extended regulatory and other delays in the closing of announced transactions can create increased volatility in our revenues from period to period, since the largest portion of our fees is typically paid upon closing. Further, a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons, including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals, failure to secure necessary financing, failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals and adverse market conditions. In cases where an engagement is terminated prior to the successful completion of a transaction or project, whether due to market reasons or otherwise, we may earn limited or no fees and may not be able to recoup the costs we incurred prior to the termination.\nA high percentage of our revenues is derived from a small number of clients, and the termination of any one engagement could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results\nEach year, we advise a limited number of clients. Our top ten client engagements accounted for 35% of our total revenues in 2019 and 34% in 2018. In 2019, there was one client that accounted for approximately 11% of revenues (advice to Total System Services, Inc. (TSYS) on its merger with Global Payments Inc.). There was no single client in 2018 that represented greater than 10% of our revenues. While the composition of the group comprising our largest clients varies significantly from year to year, we expect that our engagements will continue to be limited to a relatively small number of clients, compared to some of our larger competitors, and that an even smaller number of those clients will account for a high percentage of revenues in any particular year. As a result, the adverse impact on our results of operation from lost engagements or the non-completion of transactions on which we are advising can be significant.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues from our services in connection with mergers and acquisitions; in the event of a decline in merger and acquisition activity, it is unlikely we could offset lower revenues with revenues from other services\nThe large majority of our bankers are focused on covering clients in the context of providing merger and acquisition advisory services and those activities generate a substantial portion of our revenues. In the event of a decline in merger and acquisition activity, we may seek to generate greater business from our financing advisory and restructuring and/or capital advisory services. However, it is unlikely that we will be able to completely offset lower revenues from our merger and acquisition activities with revenues generated from either financing advisory and restructuring or capital advisory assignments. Both our financing advisory and restructuring business, which provides financing, restructuring and bankruptcy advice to companies in financial distress or their creditors or other stakeholders, and our capital advisory business, which primarily advises on secondary transactions for alternative assets, are smaller than our mergers and acquisitions advisory business, and we expect that they will remain that way for the foreseeable future.\nIf the number of debt defaults, bankruptcies or other factors affecting demand for our restructuring services is at a low level, our financial advisory and restructuring business could suffer\nWe provide various financing advisory and restructuring and related advice to companies in financial distress or to their creditors or other stakeholders. A number of factors affect demand for these advisory services, including general economic\nconditions, the availability and cost of debt and equity financing, governmental policy and changes to laws, rules and regulations, including those that protect creditors. In addition, providing restructuring advisory services entails the risk that the transaction will be unsuccessful, takes considerable time and can be subject to a bankruptcy court\u2019s discretionary power to disallow or discount our fees. If the number of debt defaults, bankruptcies or other factors affecting demand for our restructuring advisory services is at a low level, our financing advisory and restructuring business would likely be adversely affected.\nOur capital advisory business is dependent on the availability of capital for deployment in the alternative asset classes in which our clients are invested\nIn our capital advisory business, we advise institutional investors and general partners of investment funds on the sale of alternative assets funds in secondary transactions and other restructuring and/or capital raising transactions. Our ability to find suitable engagements and earn fees in this business depends on the availability of private and public capital for investments in illiquid assets such as private equity. Our ability to assist investors in selling their interests in secondary transactions or to assist fund managers and sponsors in raising capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control, such as the general economic environment, changes in the weight investors give to alternative asset investments as part of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes, and market liquidity and volatility. To the extent private and public capital focused on alternative investment opportunities for our clients is limited, the results of our capital advisory business may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by difficult market conditions and a decline in transaction activity\nAdverse market or economic conditions may affect the number, size and timing of transactions on which we provide advice and therefore adversely affect our advisory fees. Furthermore, rapid increases in equity valuations, the uncertainty of available credit and the volatility of equity markets can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of, as well as the ability of our clients to successfully complete merger and acquisition transactions, which can also adversely affect our advisory business. Furthermore, market volatility also affects our clients\u2019 ability and willingness to engage in stock-for-stock transactions.\nWhile we operate in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and South America, our operations in the United States and Europe have historically provided most of our revenues and earnings. Consequently, our revenues and profitability are particularly affected by market conditions in these locations.\nWe face strong competition from far larger firms and other independent firms, which could adversely affect our market share of the advisory business\nThe investment banking industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors across the U.S. and internationally, including the quality of our advice and service, our range of sector expertise, strength of relationships, innovation, reputation and price. We may experience pricing pressures in the future if some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. We are a relatively small investment bank, with 405 employees as of December 31, 2019 and total revenues of $301.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Most of our competitors in the investment banking industry have a far greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more managing directors to serve clients\u2019 needs, greater global reach and broader relationships with current and potential clients than we have. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the investment banking market, to compete for skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally.\nOur integrated investment banking competitors and other large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms that have established or acquired financial advisory practices and broker-dealers, or that have merged with other financial institutions, have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, hedging, foreign exchange, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. Their ability to support investment banking with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share could result in pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the ability to provide financing as well as advisory services has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors; and, because we are unable to provide such financing, we may be unable to compete for advisory clients in a significant part of the advisory market.\nIn addition to our larger competitors, a number of independent investment banks offer independent advisory services and some of these firms are larger and have greater general and industry specific coverage resources and larger financing advisory and restructuring groups than we do. Furthermore, a number of such independent firms may have greater financial resources than us. Additionally, independent advisory firms require minimal capital to operate and there are few obstacles to forming a new firm. Furthermore, there continue to be a number of newly formed independent advisory firms, some of which provide\nindustry specific advice and stress their lack of other business as a competitive advantage. As these independent firms seek to gain market share, our share of the advisory business could diminish and there could be pricing pressure, which would adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nThe inherent volatility in our financial results, from period to period, translates into volatility in our stock price\nCompared to our larger, more diversified competitors in the financial services industry, we can experience significant variations in revenues and earnings, especially between quarterly periods. These variations can generally be attributed to the fact that our revenues are usually earned in large amounts upon the successful completion of a transaction, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to our control. Adverse market conditions, geopolitical factors, the procurement of requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals and the availability of capital are all factors that impact the successful completion of a transaction and remain outside our control. Our dependence on a relatively small number of transactions for a large percentage of our revenues in each quarterly or annual reporting period also impacts our earnings rather significantly in any particular quarter or year.\nFurthermore, since substantially all of our revenues are generated from advisory fees, we lack other more stable sources of revenue such as brokerage and asset management fees, which could moderate some of the volatility in advisory revenues. As a result, it may be difficult for us to achieve consistent results and steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur revenues are subject to risks and uncertainties beyond our control\nIn many cases, we are not paid for advisory engagements that do not result in the successful consummation of a transaction or restructuring. As a result, our business is highly dependent on market conditions and the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties. For example, in our mergers and acquisitions business, a client could delay or terminate a transaction because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or shareholder approvals, failure to secure necessary financing, or adverse market conditions. In our financing advisory and restructuring business, anticipated bidders for assets of a client in financial distress may not materialize or our client may not be able to restructure its operations or indebtedness due to a failure to reach agreement with its principal creditors. In our capital advisory business, our clients may not be able to sell their fund interests in secondary transactions because anticipated investors or buyers may decline to invest in such a fund due to lack of liquidity, change in strategic direction of the investor, or other factors. In these circumstances, we may receive limited or no advisory fees and may not be able to recoup all of our expenses, despite having committed substantial time and resources to an engagement. In particular, cross-border deals may require numerous approvals in numerous jurisdictions, and the likelihood and timing of approvals may be difficult to predict. The failure of the parties to complete a transaction on which we are advising, and the consequent loss of revenue to us, could lead to large adverse movements in our revenues and earnings.\nStrategic investments and acquisitions, or foreign expansion, may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business\nWhen we make strategic investments or acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Caliburn Partnership Pty Limited (now Greenhill Australia) and Cogent Partners, LP (\"Cogent\" and now Greenhill\u2019s secondary capital advisory team), in addition to the risks associated with the integration and retention of personnel, we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including accounting and data processing systems and management controls.\nTo the extent that we pursue business opportunities in certain markets outside the United States, we will be subject to political, economic, legal, operational, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, inflation controls, excessive taxation, licensing requirements and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities and pandemic diseases. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult and costly for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally.\nIf we expand to new geographic locations, we will incur additional compensation, occupancy, integration, legal and business development costs. Additionally, it may take significant time for us to determine whether new managing directors will be profitable or effective, during which time we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on compensation, integration and business development. Accordingly, the additional costs and expenses of an expansion may be reflected in our financial results before any offsetting revenues are generated. Depending upon the extent of our expansion, and whether it is done by recruiting new managing directors, strategic investment or acquisition, the incremental costs of our expansion may be funded from cash from operations or other financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to generate or obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to fund our expansion needs, which would limit our future growth and could adversely affect our share price.\nIf we grow, we will also be required to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control our expenses.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of long-term debt that could adversely affect our business\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $365.6 million of outstanding debt under our term loan facility. We are obligated to make quarterly principal installment payments on our term loan facility of $4.7 million (or $18.8 million annually), with the remaining balance of the term loan facility due at maturity on April 12, 2024. In addition, we may be required to make annual repayments of principal on the term loan facility within ninety days of each year-end of from 0% to 50% of our annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement based on a calculation of net leverage. Such payment, if any, would be applied to the next quarterly principal installment payment. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, an excess cash flow payment was not required.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund other contractual obligations will depend largely upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from our operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal of, and interest on, any indebtedness or fund other contractual obligations.\nThe amount of our long-term debt could have adverse consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund our operating activities, including deferred compensation arrangements, working capital, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity and meet regulatory capital requirements.\nIf we only make the quarterly principal amortization payments through March 31, 2024, we will have due $285.9 million at maturity on April 12, 2024. There is no assurance that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to make either timely quarterly principal and interest payments under the credit agreement or the payment due at maturity. If we are unable to fund our debt obligations, we may need to consider taking other actions, including refinancing the debt obligation with a new debt obligation, issuing additional securities, seeking strategic investments, reducing operating costs or consider taking a combination of these actions, in each case on terms which may not be favorable to us. Further, failure to make timely principal and interest payments under the debt agreement could result in a default. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. In addition, the limitations imposed by the financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt could limit our business opportunities, which could in turn have a material impact on our operations and a material adverse effect on our share price.\nOur borrowings bear interest at variable rates, subject to, at our election, either the U.S. Prime Rate plus a margin of 2.25% or LIBOR plus a margin of 3.25%. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we incurred interest expense of $27.4 million, including the non-recurring charge of $4.8 million related to the refinancing of our term loan facility, and our borrowing rate ranged from 5.0% to 6.6%. We currently do not hedge our borrowing rate and we are subject to unanticipated interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates would increase the portion of our cash flow used to service our indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations timely, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. The FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark or what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. Although our credit agreement provides a mechanism for the replacement of LIBOR with a new broadly accepted market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States, there can be no assurances that the phase out of LIBOR\nwill not cause the cost of capital to increase.\nThe credit agreement contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business\nThe credit agreement contains covenants that may limit our ability to take actions that might be to the advantage of the Firm and our shareholders. Among other things, subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement limits our ability to:\n\u2022grant liens on our assets;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent obligations);\n\u2022make certain investments (including loans and advances);\n\u2022make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022merge or make other fundamental changes;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of property or assets;\n\u2022pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase shares and prepay certain indebtedness;\n\u2022make changes in the nature of our business;\n\u2022enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022amend or waive our organizational documents, subordinated and junior lien indebtedness;\n\u2022change our fiscal year; and\n\u2022enter into contracts restricting dividends and lien grants by non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nIn addition, we are subject to a springing total net leverage ratio financial covenant, subject to certain step downs, if our borrowings under the secured revolving loan facility exceed $12.5 million. Under the terms of the loan facilities, we are also subject to certain other non-financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend upon our future operating performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us.\nFailure to comply with any of the covenants in our credit agreement could result in a default, which would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by the credit agreement on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. Our inability to repay or refinance the loan facilities when due could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and result in our inability to meet our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our stock price.\nOur decision to return cash to our shareholders through repurchases of our common stock may not prove to be the best use of our capital or result in the effects we anticipated, including a positive return of capital to stockholders\nIn October 2017, in conjunction with our recapitalization we commenced a program to repurchase our common shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of our common stock and common stock equivalents (e.g., vesting restricted stock units) of $60.0 million and as of February 20, 2020, we had $38.0 million remaining and authorized for repurchase. We may repurchase our common stock through various means, such as open market purchases (including pursuant to 10b5-1 plans) and privately negotiated transactions. The price and timing of share repurchases, as well as the total funds ultimately expended, will be subject to market conditions and other factors, such as our results of operations, financial position and capital requirements, general business conditions, legal, tax and regulatory constraints or restrictions, any contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant. There can be no assurances of the price at which we may be able to repurchase our shares or that we will repurchase the full amount authorized for 2020 or the amount authorized in any future year. Our ability to repurchase shares is also limited by covenants in our term loan facility and Section 160 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that requires repurchases only be made out of surplus (as defined under Delaware law).\nThe impact of our share repurchase program could cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could reduce the market liquidity for our common stock and impact our ability to effectuate the\nrepurchases. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any past or future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or enhance shareholder value, or that share repurchases provide the best use of our capital because the value of our common stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock.\nOur decision to repurchase shares of our common stock will reduce our public float, which could cause our share price to decline\nAs we continue to make share repurchases we will likely reduce our \u201cpublic float,\u201d (i.e., the number of shares of our common stock that are owned by non-affiliated stockholders and available for trading in the securities markets), which most likely will reduce the volume of trading in our shares and result in reduced liquidity which may cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock unrelated to our performance.\nFurthermore, certain institutional holders of our common shares (including index funds) may require a minimum market capitalization of each of their holdings in excess of our market capitalization and therefore be required to dispose of our common stock, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline. There can be no assurance that this reduction in our public float will not result in a lower share price or reduced liquidity in the trading market for our common shares during and upon completion of our share repurchase plan. As a result of a lower stock price and reduction in our outstanding shares we are no longer a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d, which otherwise would allow us to, among other things, file automatically effective shelf registration statements. As a result, any attempt to access the public capital markets could be more expensive or subject to delays.\nOur executive officers, directors and other employees, together with their affiliated entities, hold a significant percentage of our common stock, and their interests may differ from those of our unaffiliated shareholders\nOur executive officers, directors and other employees and their affiliated entities collectively owned approximately 31% of the total shares of common stock outstanding as of February 20, 2020 (or approximately 46%, assuming vesting in full on February 20, 2020 of all restricted stock units they hold).\nAs a result of these shareholdings, our executive officers, directors and employees, together with their affiliated entities, currently are able to exercise, and may increasingly be able to exercise, significant influence over the election of our Board of Directors, the management and policies of Greenhill and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for approval, including mergers, and their interests may differ from those of our unaffiliated shareholders. In addition, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, preventing or defeating a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us.\nIn addition, sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our executive officers, directors and other employees, or their affiliated entities, or the possibility of such sales, may adversely affect the price of the common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities. Though such persons are subject to certain restrictions on sales of our common stock by applicable securities laws and our internal policies and procedures, they may nonetheless sell a substantial number of shares over time during open trading windows.\nA significant portion of the compensation of our managing directors is paid in restricted stock units, and the shares we expect to issue on the vesting of those restricted stock units could result in a significant increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding\nAs part of annual bonus and incentive compensation, we award restricted stock units to managing directors and other employees. Generally, restricted stock units are awarded in the first calendar quarter each year and for 2019 such awards will be granted in March 2020. We also award restricted stock units as a long-term incentive to new hires at the time they join Greenhill. In February 2020, 1,571,070 restricted stock units vested related to awards granted in prior years.\nAt February 20, 2020, 5,150,905, restricted stock units were outstanding. Each restricted stock unit represents the holder\u2019s right to receive one share of our common stock or a cash payment equal to the fair value thereof, at our election, following the applicable vesting date. Awards of restricted stock units to our managing directors and other employees generally vest ratably over a three to five-year period, with the first vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, or do not vest until the fourth or fifth anniversary of their grant date, when they vest in full, subject to continued employment on the vesting date. Shares will be issued in respect of restricted stock units only under the circumstances specified in the applicable award agreements and the equity incentive plan, and may be forfeited in certain cases. Vesting of restricted stock units will be accelerated and immediately vested upon a participant\u2019s death, disability or retirement, as defined in the relevant agreements. Assuming all of the conditions to vesting are fulfilled, shares in respect of the restricted stock units that were outstanding as of February 20, 2020 are scheduled to be issued as follows: 303,499 additional shares in 2020, 1,534,576 shares in 2021, 2,120,021 shares in 2022, 910,692 shares in 2023, 254,259 shares in 2024, and 27,858 shares in 2025 and beyond.\nEmployee misconduct could harm Greenhill and is difficult to detect and deter\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, insider trading or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at Greenhill. For example, misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in regulatory sanctions and material fines, or insider trading, which could lead to criminal charges. Our advisory business often requires that we deal with highly confidential information of great significance to our clients, the improper use of which may have a material adverse impact on our clients. Any breach of our clients\u2019 confidences as a result of employee misconduct may harm our reputation and impair our ability to attract and retain advisory clients, which could adversely affect our business. We also face the risk that our employees engage in work place misconduct, such as sexual harassment or discrimination, despite our implementation of policies and training to prevent and detect misconduct. In addition to impairing our ability to attract and retain clients, such misconduct may also impair our ability to attract and retain talent resulting in a materially adverse effect on our business. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have also devoted greater resources to the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, the United Kingdom has significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance with anti-bribery and other laws, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we or our employees have violated these laws or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunction on future conduct, securities litigation and reputational damage, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our common stock.\nWe may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability to our clients and affected third parties if our services are not regarded as satisfactory or if conflicts of interests should arise\nAs an independent investment banking firm, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses. Further, because we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex transactions, disputes or other matters that usually involve confidential and sensitive information or are adversarial, and because our work is the product of myriad judgments of our financial professionals and other staff operating under significant time and other pressures, we may not always perform to the standards expected by our clients. In addition, we may face reputational damage from, among other things, litigation against us, our failure to protect confidential information and/or breaches of our cybersecurity protections or other inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including inadvertent disclosures.\nWe may experience negative publicity from time to time relating to our business and our people, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other Internet forums or published by news organizations. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity. Such negative publicity may adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including whether potential clients choose to engage us and our ability to attract and retain talent.\nIn addition, our clients are often concerned about conflicts of interest that may arise in the course of engagements. While we have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to reduce the risks associated with the execution of transactions, the rendering of fairness opinions and potential conflicts of interest, these policies may not be adhered to by our employees or be effective in reducing these risks. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation. We are unable to estimate the amount of monetary damages which could be assessed or reputational harm that could occur as a result of any such regulatory sanction or client litigation.\nAs a financial advisor on significant transactions, we face substantial litigation risk\nOur role as advisor to our clients on important mergers and acquisitions or restructuring transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including rendering fairness opinions in connection with mergers and other transactions. Our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties, including shareholders of our clients who could bring actions against us. In recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial advisors has been increasing, including claims for aiding and abetting client misconduct. Moreover, judicial scrutiny and criticism of investment banker performance and activities has increased, creating risk that our services in a litigated transaction could be criticized by the court. These risks\noften may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nOur engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services, but these provisions may not protect us fully or may not be enforceable in all cases. The effectiveness of these indemnities in limiting our financial exposure is also dependent on our client\u2019s capacity to pay the amounts claimed. As a result, we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business prospects. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the financial services industry, which creates risk of non-compliance that could adversely affect our business and reputation\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia. In addition, as we expand our international operations by opening new offices outside the United States or by carrying out transactions or private placement activities internationally, we are increasingly subject to new regulatory requirements. Regulatory and self-regulatory agencies, as well as securities commissions, in various jurisdictions in which we do business are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, issuance of cease and desist orders or suspension of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our license or registration or the registration of any of our regulated subsidiaries. In addition, as a result of recent highly publicized scandals in the financial services industry, scrutiny by regulators of financial services firms has increased significantly. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients.\nChange in applicable law and regulatory schemes could adversely affect our business\nFrom time to time, the United States and other national governments in the countries in which we operate, as well as related regulatory authorities and local governments, adopt new rules that affect our business. Many of the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Consequently, these regulations may serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. There can be no assurance that new regulations will not be imposed that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nIn addition, public figures in the United States, including the current President, members of his administration and other public officials, including members of the current U.S. Congress, continue to signal a willingness to revise, renegotiate, or terminate various multilateral trade agreements under which U.S. companies currently exchange products and services around the world and to impose taxes or other adverse consequences on certain business activities. It is not known what specific measures might be proposed or how they would be implemented and enforced. There can be no assurance that pending or future legislation or executive action in the U.S. that could significantly increase costs with respect to our foreign operations and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, will not be enacted. In addition, such steps, if adopted, could also lead to retaliatory actions by other foreign governments through measures to prohibit, reduce or discourage business of foreign companies, or other means, which could make it more difficult for us to do business in those countries.\nCompliance with any new laws or regulations could also make our compliance efforts more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our ability to prevent misappropriation, and we may become subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could be time consuming, costly, and could require changes to our business.\nWe have not registered our intellectual property in all of our current or potential markets, and may not be able to do so in the future. Any applications for registration of our intellectual property may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.\nContractual rights with third parties and intellectual property laws may be insufficient to prevent third parties from infringing on or misappropriating our intellectual property rights. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This may result in a significant diversion of resources, and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property rights could also harm our reputation and otherwise be harmful to the competitiveness of our business.\nIn addition, we may be subject to intellectual property-related claims by third parties, such as for:\n\u2022patent, trademark or copyright infringement;\n\u2022breach of patent, trademark or copyright license usage rights; or\n\u2022misappropriation of trade secrets.\nAny such claims or resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we are found to have infringed or misappropriated third-party intellectual property rights, we could in some circumstances be required to make changes to our business to avoid such infringement or misappropriation. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties.\nLegal restrictions on our clients may reduce the demand for our services\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, applicable to our clients may also adversely affect our businesses. For example, changes in antitrust enforcement could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity, and changes in regulation could restrict the activities of our clients and their need for the types of advisory services that we provide to them.\nThe cost of compliance with international employment, labor, benefits and tax regulations may adversely affect our business and hamper our ability to expand internationally\nSince we operate our business both in the United States and internationally, we are subject to many distinct employment, labor, benefits and tax laws in each state and country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment practices and our relations with our employees and service providers. If the existing regulations under which we operate are modified or interpreted differently, or new regulations are issued and we are unable to comply with these regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected or the cost of compliance may make it difficult to expand into new international markets. Additionally, our competitiveness in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens, the purchase of services from local businesses, or requiring local ownership.\nUncertainty regarding Brexit and the outcome of future arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom may adversely affect our business\nWe have a presence in certain European Union countries, including the U.K. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". The European Union and the U.K. have ratified a withdrawal agreement, which provides for a transition period for the European Union and the U.K. to negotiate and agree to a framework for their future relationship. The transition period is currently scheduled to end on December 31, 2020 and the relationship between the European Union and the U.K. beyond that date is uncertain. A failure to reach an agreement at the end of the transition period could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions, contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, and introduce significant legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations. Further, even if an agreement is reached at the end of the transition period, there is uncertainty regarding the nature of the long-term relationship between the European Union and the U.K.\nConditions arising from Brexit could adversely affect our U.K. business and operations, including by reducing the volume or size of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic corporate transactions on which we seek to advise, and further, will likely increase our legal, compliance and operational costs. We incorporated a new German entity in 2019 in order to continue to provide investment banking services throughout the European Union and submitted an application to BaFin requesting such permission. We have received approval of our application from BaFin and subject to other requisite approvals we will be able to provide investment banking services from our offices in Frankfurt, Madrid and our new operations in Paris prior to the expiration of the UK's transition period.\nThe value of our goodwill may decline in the future, which could adversely affect our financial results\nA significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates, any or all of which could be materially affected by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may require that we take charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill. Future regulatory actions also could have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our ability to make share repurchases or pay dividends and the market value of our common stock.\nOur failure to prevent a cyber-security attack may disrupt our businesses, harm our reputation, result in losses or limit our growth\nOur clients typically provide us with sensitive and confidential information, which in the course of due diligence may include data of customers of our clients, including personal information. We rely heavily on our technological and communications infrastructure to securely process, transmit and store such information among our locations around the world and with our professional staff, clients, alliance partners and vendors. If any of our technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers) do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may also encounter attempted security breaches and cyber-attacks on our critical data, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. We are not aware of any such occurrence that may have had a material impact to date, but a successful breach of our systems, or the systems used by our clients and other third parties, could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems or third-party systems on which we rely and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information. Breaches of our or third-party network security systems on which we rely could involve attacks that are intended to obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other means and could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties outside the firm. We may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the likelihood and effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information and communication systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed, especially because the cyber-attack techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched. As cyber threats continue to multiply, become more sophisticated and threaten additional aspects of our businesses, we may also be required to expend additional resources on information security and compliance costs in order to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information or communication systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nWe depend on our headquarters in New York City, where a large number of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. A disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including catastrophic events such as hurricanes or other larger scale catastrophes, a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and other disasters are inherently unpredictable. Our disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. Although we carry insurance to mitigate our exposure to certain catastrophic events, our insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all and will not cover related reputational harm.\nEvolving data privacy regulations, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), may subject us to significant penalties\nAs part of our business, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including those related to compliance with U.S. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. For example, in May 2018, the European Union\u2019s GDPR came into effect, and changed how businesses can collect, use and process the personal data of European Union residents. The GDPR has\nextraterritorial effect and imposes a mandatory duty on businesses to self-report personal data breaches to authorities, and, under certain circumstances, to affected individuals. The GDPR also grants individuals the right to erasure (commonly referred to as the right to be forgotten), which may put a burden on us to erase records upon request. Compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements may increase our legal, compliance, and operational costs. Non-compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements can result in significant penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, expose us to legal and regulatory costs, and impair our reputation.\nOther jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business, have also enacted or are considering data privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes certain requirements with respect to personal information of California residents. Increasingly numerous, fast-changing, and complex legislation related to data privacy may result in greater compliance costs, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and significant penalties. New and changing regulations may increase compliance costs such that they hamper our ability to expand into new territories.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations\nBecause our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and we receive a portion of our revenue in other currencies, predominantly in British pounds, euros, and Australian dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. In addition, we pay compensation to our non-U.S. employees and certain of our other expenses in such currencies. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign exchange fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or otherwise. An appreciation or depreciation of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in an adverse or beneficial impact to our financial results.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and may decline\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including the perceived prospects of Greenhill and the financial services industry in general, differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors, changes in general economic or market conditions, broad market fluctuations, the impact of increased leverage on our financial position and the reduction in float as a result of our share repurchase plan. Since a significant portion of the compensation of our managing directors and certain other employees is paid in restricted stock units, and our employees rely upon the ability of share sales to generate additional cash flow, a decline in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, including our managing directors. Similarly, our ability to recruit managing directors and other professionals may be adversely affected by a decline in the price of our stock.\nWe could change our existing dividend policy in the future, which could adversely affect our stock price\nWe began paying quarterly cash dividends to holders of record of our common stock in June 2004. During 2019, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share. In January 2020, our Board of Directors declared by unanimous written consent a dividend of $0.05 per share to be paid on March 18, 2020 to common stockholders of record on March 4, 2020. We intend to continue to pay such reduced quarterly dividends, subject to capital availability, cash flows and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Future declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon, among other things, general financial conditions, capital requirements and surplus, cash flows, debt service obligations, our recent and expected future operations and earnings, contractual restrictions and other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. For example, in the event that there is deterioration in our financial performance and/or our liquidity position, a downturn in global economic conditions or disruptions in the credit markets and our ability to obtain financing, our Board of Directors could decide to further reduce or even suspend dividend payments in the future. As a Delaware corporation, we are required to meet certain surplus thresholds for our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially adversely affect our business\nWe have documented and tested our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors regarding our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could materially adversely affect our business.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nWe have made statements under the captions \u201cBusiness\u201d, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are forward-looking statements.

Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K may include additional factors which could impact our business and financial performance. In particular, you should consider the numerous risks outlined in the foregoing paragraphs of this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nMoreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give assurances that those expectations will be achieved, nor can we guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.\nMoreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update or review any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this filing to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 90164, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "GHL"}
