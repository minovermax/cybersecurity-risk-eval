{"cik": "922612", "company": "SCHMITT INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-08-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company (see the forward-looking statements disclaimer at the beginning of Part 1, Item 1 in this Report). In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that the Company now views as minor could become more significant. If the Company were unable to adequately respond to any risks, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company cannot be certain that any actions taken to reduce known or unknown risks and uncertainties will be effective.\nGeneral economic conditions and uncertainties may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the industrial, manufacturing and automotive sectors in the U.S., Asia and Europe, and their impact on levels of capital spending, which have deteriorated significantly in the past and may become depressed, or be subject to further deterioration. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the Company\u2019s products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, reduction in demand for our customers\u2019 products, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 access to credit and the stability of the global financial system, the overall health of our markets, unemployment and other macroeconomic factors generally affecting commercial and industrial spending behavior.\nPast distress in the global financial markets and global economy resulted in reduced liquidity and a tightening of credit markets. If these conditions were to reoccur, the Company could experience several potential adverse effects, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company\u2019s products, the insolvency of customers resulting in reduced sales and bad debts, and the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product development and production delays.\nThe Company\u2019s primary markets are volatile and unpredictable\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the demand for our various products in a variety of commercial and industrial markets. In the past, demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic conditions, both domestically and\ninternationally, the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers as well as the relative mix of those orders and variations in the volume of orders for a particular product line in a particular quarter.\nNew products may not be developed to satisfy changes in consumer demands\nThe failure to develop new products or enhance existing products or react to changes in existing technologies could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to competitors. Financial performance depends on the ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New product opportunities may not be identified and developed and brought to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, or a fundamental shift in technologies in the product markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position within historic industries.\nCompetition is intense and the Company\u2019s failure to compete effectively would adversely affect its business\nCompetition in the markets for the Company\u2019s products is intense. The speed with which the Company can identify new applications for the Company\u2019s various technologies, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to those new markets are important competitive factors. The principal competitive factors in the Company\u2019s markets are product features, performance, reliability and price. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, engineering, production and marketing resources than we do. Those competitors with greater resources may, in addition to other things, be able to better withstand periodic downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, or more quickly develop enhancements to products that compete with the products we manufacture and market. New companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in those markets. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to compete effectively in the future, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience increased pricing pressure\nWe have experienced and continue to experience pricing pressure in the sale of our products, from both competitors and customers. Pricing pressures typically have become more intense during cyclical downturns when competitors seek to maintain or increase market share, reduce inventory or introduce more technologically advanced products or lower cost products. In addition, we may agree to pricing concessions or extended payment terms with our customers in connection with volume orders or to reduce cost of ownership in highly competitive applications. Our business, financial condition, margins or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by competitive pressure and intense price-based competition.\nProduction time and the overall cost of products could increase if any of the primary suppliers are lost or if a primary supplier increased the prices of raw materials\nManufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. The results of operations could be adversely affected if adequate supplies of raw materials cannot be obtained in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly.\nThe Company may not be able to ramp up manufacturing to satisfy increasing orders, which may lead to the loss of significant revenue opportunities\nThe Company manufactures several different product lines, all of which involve complicated technology and individual attention for each product made. The production time for each product can vary, depending on a variety of circumstances, including component availability, timing of delivery of components from suppliers and employee availability. Should the Company receive a large increase in orders, an increase in the size of orders or a shortening of the required delivery time on existing orders, the Company may not be able to ramp up manufacturing to satisfy customer expectations, which may lead to the loss of significant revenue opportunities.\nThe Company maintains a significant investment in inventories in anticipation of future sales\nThe Company believes it maintains a competitive advantage by shipping product to its customers more rapidly than its competitors. As a result, the Company has a significant investment in inventories. These inventories are recorded using the lower of cost or market method, which requires management to make certain estimates. Management evaluates the recorded inventory values based on customer demand, market trends and expected future sales, and changes these estimates accordingly. A significant shortfall of sales may result in carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods and raw materials thereby increasing the risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs. As a result, the Company may not carry adequate reserves to offset such write-downs.\nThe Company\u2019s existing cash may not be sufficient and the Company may not be able to obtain financing to fund operations or future growth\nIn December 2017, the Company successfully completed its Rights Offering, which provided the Company net cash proceeds of $2,386,029. As of May 31, 2018, the Company had a cash and restricted balance of $2,111,533 as compared to a cash balance of $867,607 as of May 31, 2017, and had no bank line of credit facility in 2018 or 2017. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents combined with the cash from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the near term. However, if sales weaken and the Company is unable to reduce its operating costs in a timely manner or access additional financing, the Company may have to continue to reduce its cash balance, which could significantly impact the liquidity or operations of the Company, and may have to explore other financing alternatives to raise cash.\nFluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict future performance\nQuarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond management\u2019s control. As a result of quarterly operating fluctuations, it is important to realize quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nA reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.\nIn Fiscal 2018, 10.1% of our revenues were derived from a single customer, and 11.4% of our accounts receivable as of May 31, 2018 were from a single customer. Customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in operating results and sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by significant customers.\nThe Company may experience a downturn due to the risks of operating a global business\nSales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for 50.1% of total sales in Fiscal 2018. We expect that sales to customers outside the U.S. will continue to represent a significant percentage of sales in the future. We currently have a sales and service office in Coventry, England and a sales office in Shanghai, China. We may need to increase our foreign operations in the future. Our international sales, purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, many of which are outside of our control, including periodic local or geographical economic downturns, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, difficulties in protecting intellectual property, shipping delays and disruptions, local labor disputes, unexpected changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and duties and difficulties in managing a global presence, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable, and managing distributors and sales representatives. Tariffs and international trade disputes present an unpredictable risk to business outcomes.\nThe Company faces risks from international sales and currency fluctuations\nThe Company markets and sells its products worldwide and international sales have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of future revenue. International sales are subject to a\nnumber of risks, including: the imposition of governmental controls; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; political and economic instability; general economic conditions; and fluctuations in foreign currencies. In a referendum held in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) on June 23, 2016, a majority of those voting voted for the UK to leave the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The terms of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will be negotiated over time. In the meantime, there are immediate uncertainties that face U.S. companies with operations in the UK and the EU, of which Schmitt is one of those companies. Specifically, currency fluctuations will impact sales, costs and earnings. At one point shortly after the Brexit vote, the British pound fell more than 10% to the lowest level since 1985. Currencies could remain volatile for the foreseeable future. No assurances can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on future international sales and operations and, consequently, on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to reduce operating costs quickly enough if sales decline\nOperating expenses are generally fixed in nature and largely based on anticipated sales. However, should future sales decline significantly and rapidly, there is no guarantee management could take actions that would further reduce operating expenses in either a timely manner or without seriously impacting the operations of the Company.\nFuture success depends in part on attracting and retaining key management and qualified technical and sales personnel\nFuture success depends on the efforts and continued services of key management, technical and sales personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and there is no assurance key technical and sales personnel can be retained or that other highly qualified technical and sales personnel as required can be attracted, assimilated and retained. There is also no guarantee that key employees will not leave and subsequently compete against the Company. The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and stock price\nActivist shareholders may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and governance. Some activists may seek to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While we always welcome constructive shareholder input, responding to activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our directors and management from our business. Also, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activist efforts may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability, or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and partners, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. These types of actions could cause adverse volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in the effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations\nThe Company\u2019s future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from future, potential tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretations of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nFailure to protect intellectual property rights could adversely affect future performance and growth\nFailure to protect existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or paying other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights. The Company relies on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. There is no assurance any of the Company\u2019s U.S. patents will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies.\nChanges in securities laws and regulations have increased and could continue to increase Company expenses\nChanges in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have increased and may continue to increase Company expenses as the Company devotes resources to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the NASDAQ Capital Market, on which the Company\u2019s common stock is listed, has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance. These laws, rules and regulations have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. The Company may be required to hire additional personnel and use outside legal, accounting and advisory services to address these laws, rules and regulations. The Company also expects these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future, and the Company may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Further, the Company\u2019s board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which would adversely affect the Company.", "PERMNO": 81225, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "SMIT"}
