{"cik": "770460", "company": "PEOPLES FINANCIAL CORP /MS/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1a - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s stock involves a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision. The realization of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the price of its common stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS\nGreater than expected loan losses may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s investment and loan portfolio subject the Company to credit risk. Credit losses are always inherent in the banking business but the continuing challenging economic environment in the Company\u2019s trade area presents even more exposure to loss. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors. The Company believes that its current allowance for loan losses is adequate and appropriate. However, if the Company\u2019s assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. In the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient to cover any remaining loan balances, the Company could experience significant loan losses or increase the provision for loan losses or both, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. In fact, these conditions were a significant cause of the net losses experienced by the Company in prior years. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nThe Company has a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, and a downturn in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect earnings.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. At December 31, 2018, approximately 85% of the Company\u2019s loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment if the borrower defaults and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Further deterioration in the value of real estate generally or in the Company\u2019s trade area specifically could significantly impair the value of the collateral and restrict the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Furthermore, it is likely that the Company would be required to increase the provision for loan losses. If the Company were required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate value or to increase the allowance for loan losses, the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company has a high concentration of exposure to a number of industries.\nThe Company has concentrations of loan exposure to the hotel/motel and gaming industries. At December 31, 2018, these exposures were approximately $44,112,000 and $25,767,000 or 16% and 9%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio. Economic conditions have negatively impacted tourism, which is one of the major factors for success in these industries. Given the size of these relationships, a significant loss in either of these portfolios could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe continuing economic downturn or a natural disaster, especially one affecting the Company\u2019s trade area, could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s trade area includes the Mississippi Gulf Coast and portions of southeast Louisiana and southwest Alabama. With the exception of a number of credits that are considered out of area, the Company\u2019s credit exposure is generally limited to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Although the national economy has shown signs of improvement, local conditions appear to be lagging this trend. As a result, the Company is at risk from continuing adverse business developments in its trade area, including declining real estate value, increasing loan delinquencies, personal and business bankruptcies and unemployment rates. The recent decline in oil prices has effected the economy in southeast Louisiana and may negatively impact the entire trade area. The Company is also at risk to weather-related disasters including hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. If the economy in the Company\u2019s trade area experiences a natural disaster or worsening economic conditions, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nEconomic factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nIn addition to funds provided by its banking activities such as deposits, loan payments and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities, the Company\u2019s liquidity needs have traditionally been met through the purchase of federal funds, often on an unsecured basis, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d). Disruption in the financial markets in previous years negatively impacted the availability of these unsecured funds. As a result, the Company increased its borrowing lines with the FHLB and secured approval to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Discount Window Primary Credit Program.\nThe Company is subject to industry competition which may have an impact on its success.\nThe profitability of the Company depends on its ability to compete successfully. The Company operates in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than the Company. The Company faces competition in its trade area from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries. Some of these non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company or the Bank and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Increased competition could require the Company to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates offered on loans, which could adversely affect and also limit future growth and earnings prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company is asset sensitive to market interest rates, as its assets reprice more quickly to changes in interest rates than do its liabilities. Interest rates dropped by the unprecedented amount of 400 basis points during 2008 as the Federal Reserve, through its Federal Open Market\nCommittee, attempted to stabilize the financial markets, reduce the effects of the recession and stimulate the economy. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Federal Reserve increased the discount rate 125 basis points with the fed funds and prime interest rates increasing as a result. Discount or fed funds rate changes that occur in 2019 may affect the Company\u2019s earnings in the current year and/or in the future.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMany factors affect the demand for loans and the ability to attract deposits, including changes in government economic and monetary policies, particularly by the Federal Reserve, modifications to tax, banking and credit laws and regulations, national, state and local economic growth rates and employment rates. Previous legislation such as Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (\u201cEESA\u201d) and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d) were passed to address issues facing certain financial institutions, improve the general availability of credit for consumers and businesses, stimulate the national economy and promote long-term growth and stability. Further regulation impacting the Company and its operations include The Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to increase transparency, accountability and oversight over financial firms and products as well as to provide protection to consumers. The new capital requirements under BASEL III raise minimum capital requirements, change the definition of capital, create a capital conservation buffer and increase risk weights for certain assets and exposures. There can be no assurance that EESA, ARRA, Dodd-Frank or BASEL III will achieve their intended purposes. Furthermore, their failure could result in continuing or worsening economic and market conditions, and this could adversely affect our operations.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the MDBCF. New regulations issued by these agencies, including but not limited to those relating to the Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, The Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to carry on its business activities. The Company is also subject to various other federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact the Company\u2019s business plans or result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or civil money penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, it cannot assure that such violations will be prevented.\nThe Company is also subject to laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or results of operations of the Company and may also require additional effort or cost to implement.\nThere may be risks resulting from extensive use of models in the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nAlso, information the Company provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator\u2019s perception that the quality of the Company\u2019s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nThe use of third-party service providers by the Company and the Bank and other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nThe Company and the Bank regularly use third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of their businesses. The Company also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties, and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC. Under regulatory guidance, the Company and the Bank are required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. The Company expects that the regulators will hold it responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which the Company or the Bank has these relationships. The Company and the Bank maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks. While the Company believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that the Company or the Bank has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, the Company and the Bank could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThe Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosures controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with the regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the regulations currently being promulgated by various federal regulatory agencies, along with other regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry, could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company is unable to completely evaluate these potential effects at this time. It is also possible that these measures could adversely affect the creditworthiness of counterparties, which could increase the Company\u2019s risk profile.\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements which would adversely affect its net income and future growth.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, which, among other things, will change the way in which hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, are treated for purposes of determining a bank holding company\u2019s regulatory capital. On June 14, 2011, the federal banking agencies published a final rule regarding minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies consistent with the requirements of Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act. For a more detailed description of the minimum capital requirements see \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Capital Standards\u201d. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, or could require the Company to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, on September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III. In 2013, regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on Basel III. The revised standards create a new emphasis on Tier 1 common equity, modify eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and modify the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets. The revised standards require the following:\n\u2022\nTier 1 Common Equity. For all supervised financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets (\u201cTier 1 Common Equity Capital ratio\u201d) must be at least 4.5%. To be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d the Tier 1 Common Equity Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum 4.5% (or 7% overall) is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. Tier 1 common equity capital consists of core components of Tier 1 capital: common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items.\n\u2022\nTier 1 Capital Ratio. For all banking organizations, including the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 6%. The threshold is raised from the current 4%, and the risk-weighting method is changed as mentioned above. To be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d the Tier 1 capital ratio must be at least 8%.\n\u2022\nTotal Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. Although this threshold is unchanged from current requirements, as mentioned above the method for risk-weighting assets has been changed. As a result of that method change, many banks could have experienced a reduction in this ratio if the change had been effective immediately when the rules were adopted.\n\u2022\nLeverage Ratio - Base. For all banking organizations, including the Bank, the leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d the leverage ratio must be at least 5%.\n\u2022\nLeverage Ratio - Supplemental. For the largest internationally active banking organizations, not including the Bank, a minimum supplementary leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures.\nThe revised standards took effect on January 1, 2014 for the larger, so-called advanced-approaches institutions, and on January 1, 2015 for all other institutions, including the Company and the Bank. The capital conservation buffer requirement is subject to a phase-in period.\nAdditionally, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which implements CECL as a new impairment model based on expected credit losses, will require the Company and the Bank to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. CECL generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital. The Company cannot predict the impact of CECL on its reserves and capital; however, the impact could be material.\nThe regulatory capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank may continue to evolve. Additionally, certain provisions of the EGRRCPA have the potential to limit the application of current capital rules to the Company and the Bank if certain elections are made by the Company or Bank, subject to further rulemaking that has not yet been enacted. Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on the Company and the Bank.\nFuture increases in minimum capital requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in regulators taking formal or informal actions against the Company which could restrict future growth or operations.\nThe Company relies heavily on technology and computer systems, and disruptions of, failures of, advances in and changes in technology could significantly affect business.\nAs is customary in the banking industry, the Company is dependent upon automated and non-automated systems to record and process our transaction volume. This poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems by employees, customers or outsiders will result in losses. Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose the Company to reputational risk, the loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control, such as computer viruses, communication and energy disruption and unethical individuals with technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of data processing systems. The Company\u2019s ability to compete depends on the ability to continue to adapt to changes in technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet customers\u2019 demands. The ability of the Company and the Bank to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects. Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in utilizing such new technologies. Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose the Company and the Bank to additional risks, including cybersecurity risk.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition or results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects all current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information\nto determine credit loss estimates. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020, and adoption of this ASU could materially affect its allowance for loan loss methodology, financial condition, capital levels and results of operations, including expenses the Company may incur in implementing this ASU. For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note A - Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nSecurities issued by the Company are not FDIC insured.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of the Bank and is not insured by the FDIC, the Bank Insurance Fund or any other government agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer and is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nThe directors of the Company and executive management own a significant number of shares of stock, allowing further control over business and corporate affairs.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 10% of the outstanding common stock of Peoples Financial Corporation. As a result, in addition to their day-to-day management roles, they will be able to exercise significant influence on the Company\u2019s business as shareholders, including influence over election of the Board and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. The Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the banking and financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nAdditionally, general market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of other larger bank holding companies.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on The OTCQX Best Market. The average daily trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is low, generally less than that of many of its competitors and other larger bank holding companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Company\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause volatility in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws, Mississippi law and state and federal banking regulations could delay or prevent a takeover by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and of state and federal law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Company. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Company\u2019s shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquirer and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There are also Mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in the Company\u2019s articles and bylaws could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquirer.\nThe Company\u2019s future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nSince the Company is a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, the Company has no material source of funds other than dividends received from the Bank. Therefore, the ability to pay dividends to the shareholders will depend on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Moreover, banks and bank holding companies are both subject to certain federal and state regulatory restrictions on cash dividends. Currently, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the MDBCF must approve the declaration and payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank, respectively.", "PERMNO": 88257, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PFBX"}
