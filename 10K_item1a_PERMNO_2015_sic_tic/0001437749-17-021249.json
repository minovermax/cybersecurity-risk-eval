{"cik": "357294", "company": "HOVNANIAN ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.\nThe homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, real estate markets, and weather and other environmental conditions, which could affect our ability to build homes at prices our customers are willing or able to pay, could reduce profits that may not be recaptured, could result in cancellation of sales contracts, and could affect our liquidity.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical, has from time to time experienced significant difficulties, and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as:\n\u25cf\nEmployment levels and job growth;\n\u25cf\nAvailability of financing for home buyers;\n\u25cf\nInterest rates;\n\u25cf\nAdverse changes in tax laws;\n\u25cf\nForeclosure rates;\n\u25cf\nInflation;\n\u25cf\nConsumer confidence;\n\u25cf\nHousing demand in general and for our particular community locations and product designs, as well as consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to other housing alternatives;\n\u25cf\nPopulation growth; and\n\u25cf\nAvailability of water supply in locations in which we operate.\nTurmoil in the financial markets could affect our liquidity. In addition, our cash balances are primarily invested in short-term government-backed instruments. The remaining cash balances are held at numerous financial institutions and may, at times, exceed insurable amounts. We seek to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major financial institutions and diversifying our investments. In addition, our homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit. We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that can be used for general purposes, or under which letters of credit may be issued, which matures in 2018. We also have certain stand-alone letter of credit facilities and agreements pursuant to which letters of credit are issued. However, we may need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these facilities and agreements. If we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business, we may be adversely affected, particularly in light of the upcoming maturity of our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nWeather conditions and man-made or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires and other environmental conditions, can harm the local homebuilding business. For example, in September 2017, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma caused disruption and delays in Houston and Florida which may continue to impact results in these markets in fiscal 2018. Similarly, our production process slowed and our cost of operations increased in Texas during fiscal 2015 as a result of record wet conditions in this state and, in August 2011 and October 2012, Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy, respectively, caused widespread flooding and disruptions on the Atlantic seaboard, which impacted our sales and construction activity in affected markets during those months.\nThe difficulties described above could cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes. In addition, our insurance may not fully cover business interruptions or losses caused by weather conditions and manmade or natural disasters and we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because we fix our prices up to 12 months in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts. Some home buyers may also cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether.\nOur business, liquidity and results of operations are still recovering from the significant and sustained homebuilding downturn and another downturn in the homebuilding industry could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained downturn that began in 2007, during which the lowest volumes of housing starts were significantly below troughs in previous downturns. This downturn resulted in an industry-wide softening of demand for new homes due to a lack of consumer confidence, decreased availability of mortgage financing, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories, among other factors. In addition, an oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties, resale homes, and foreclosures, depressed prices and reduced margins for the sale of new homes. Industry conditions had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Further, we had substantially increased our inventory through fiscal 2006, which required significant cash outlays and which increased our price and margin exposure as we worked through this inventory. Although the homebuilding market has improved in the last few years, the volume of 2017 housing starts is still just above previous volume troughs in historical cycles, and our business, liquidity and results of operations continue to be impacted by the lasting effects of the significant and sustained downturn and it may continue to materially adverse our business and results of operations in future years. If the homebuilding industry experiences another significant or sustained downturn, it would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in future years.\nSeveral challenges, such as general U.S. economic uncertainty and the potential for more rapid inflation, extreme weather conditions, increasing cycle times due to labor shortages, increasing labor and materials costs, the restrictive mortgage lending environment and rising mortgage interest rates, could further impact the housing market and, consequently, our performance. For example, if rising house construction costs substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers we may be limited in our ability to raise home sales prices, which may result in lower gross margins.\nOur leverage places burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness, may restrict our ability to operate, may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of debt.\n\u25cf\nOur debt (excluding nonrecourse secured debt and debt of our financial subsidiaries), as of October 31, 2017, including the debt of the subsidiaries that guarantee our debt, was $1,661.5 million ($1,654.0 million net of discount), which includes borrowings under our $75.0 million revolving credit facility under which at October 31, 2017, there were $52.0 million of borrowings and $14.6 million of letters of credit outstanding resulting in available borrowing capacity of $8.4 million.\n\u25cf\nOur debt service payments for the 12-month period ended October 31, 2017, were $109.7 million, substantially all of which represented interest incurred and the remainder of which represented payments on the principal of our amortizing notes, and do not include repurchases of our debt in open market transactions, principal and interest on nonrecourse secured debt, debt of our financial subsidiaries and fees under our letter of credit and other credit facilities and agreements.\nAs of October 31, 2017, in addition to the $14.6 million letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we had $1.7 million in aggregate outstanding face amount of letters of credit issued under various letter of credit and other credit facilities and agreements, certain of which were collateralized by $1.7 million of cash. Our fees for these letters of credit for the year ended October 31, 2017, which are based on both the used and unused portion of the facilities and agreements, were $1.2 million. We also had substantial contractual commitments and contingent obligations, including $199.5 million of performance bonds as of October 31, 2017. See Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nOur significant amount of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf\nLimit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or other requirements;\n\u25cf\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including land investments;\n\u25cf\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u25cf\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nLimit our ability to implement our strategies and operational actions;\n\u25cf\nRequire us to consider selling some of our assets or debt or equity securities, possibly on unfavorable terms, to satisfy obligations; and\n\u25cf\nMake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business and general economic conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance. We are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our businesses are also affected by customer sentiment and financial, political, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of equity securities, the refinancing of debt, or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations to the extent we have any floating rate indebtedness. A higher interest rate on our debt service obligations could result in lower earnings or increased losses.\nOur sources of liquidity are limited and may not be sufficient to meet our needs.\nWe are largely dependent on our current cash balance and future cash flows from operations (which may not be positive) to enable us to service our indebtedness, to cover our operating expenses, and/or to fund our other liquidity needs. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were $297.6 million and $387.7 million, respectively. Depending on the levels of our land purchases, we could generate negative or positive cash flow in future years. In 2016, we used a significant portion of cash to repay debt because financing was unavailable to us in the capital and loan markets. If the homebuilding industry does not experience improved conditions over the next several years, our cash flows could be insufficient to fund our obligations and support land purchases; if we cannot buy additional land we would ultimately be unable to generate future revenues from the sale of houses. In addition, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity including amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in 2018, $369 million principal of unsecured senior notes which will mature during calendar year 2019, and our $75 million Term Loan which will mature in 2019 (subject to earlier maturity if our 7.0% Senior Notes due 2019 have not been refinanced with a maturity date after January 15, 2021), which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations (pursuant to the terms of certain of our senior secured notes we generally must refinance our unsecured senior notes due 2019 and may not use cash to satisfy our obligations thereunder) or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or, if successful, made on desirable terms and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations. We have also entered into certain cash collateralized letters of credit agreements and facilities that require us to maintain specified amounts of cash in segregated accounts as collateral to support our letters of credit issued thereunder. If our available cash and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service and other obligations, we could face liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to be used to service indebtedness or may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. For additional information about capital resources and liquidity, see Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nOur cash flows, liquidity and consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain letters of credit.\nOur homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit. We have an unsecured revolving credit facility under which letters of credit may be issued, which matures in 2018. We also have certain stand-alone letter of credit facilities and agreements pursuant to which letters of credit are issued. However, we may need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these facilities and agreements. If we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business, we may be adversely affected, particularly in light of the upcoming maturity of our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nWe may have difficulty in obtaining the additional financing required to operate and develop our business.\nOur operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to seek additional capital, whether from sales of debt or equity securities or borrowing additional money, for the future growth and development of our business. The terms and/or availability of additional capital is uncertain. Moreover, the agreements governing our outstanding debt instruments contain provisions that restrict the debt we may incur in the future (including a requirement (i) to refinance our 7% Senior Notes due 2019 and 8% Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201cExisting Unsecured Notes\u201d) with indebtedness that may not be scheduled to mature earlier than our 10.50% Senior Notes due 2024 or equity, subject to an exception for up to $50 million of cash repurchases and (ii) in our $75.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) and the 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 that any new or refinancing indebtedness may not be scheduled to mature earlier than specified dates in 2021) and our ability to pay dividends on equity. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations. In addition, pledging substantially all of our assets to support our term loans and our senior secured notes may make it more difficult to raise additional financing in the future.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to operate, and if our financial performance worsens, we may not be able to undertake transactions within the restrictions of our debt instruments.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding debt securities, the Term Loan Facility and our revolving credit facility impose certain restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 operations and activities. The most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence (including maturity date requirements), creating liens, sales of assets (including in certain land banking transactions), cash distributions, including paying dividends on common and preferred stock, capital stock, Existing Unsecured Notes and subordinated debt repurchases, and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Because of these restrictions, we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our common and preferred stock and anticipate that we will remain prohibited for the foreseeable future.\nThe restrictions in our debt instruments could prohibit or restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 activities, such as undertaking capital raising or restructuring activities or entering into other transactions. In such a situation, we may be unable to amend the instrument or obtain a waiver. In addition, if we fail to comply with these restrictions or to make timely payments on this debt and other material indebtedness, an event of default could occur and our debt under these debt instruments could become due and payable prior to maturity. Any such event of default could lead to cross defaults under certain of our other debt or negatively impact other covenants. In these situations, we may be unable to amend the applicable instrument or obtain a waiver without significant additional cost, or at all. In such a situation, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing. Any such situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the Company.\nThe terms of our debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness.\nUnder the terms of our indebtedness under our indentures and credit facilities, we have the ability, subject to our debt covenants, to incur additional amounts of debt. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could magnify the risks described above. In addition, certain obligations, such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds issued in the ordinary course of business, including those issued under our stand-alone letter of credit agreements and facilities, are not considered indebtedness under our debt instruments (and may be secured), and therefore, are not subject to limits in our debt covenants.\nWe could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating.\nOur ability to access capital on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to service our indebtedness to cover our operating expenses and to fund our other liquidity needs. For example, during fiscal 2011 and thereafter, credit agencies took a series of negative actions with respect to their credit ratings of us and our debt. More recently, in April, May and August 2016, Moody\u2019s Investor Services and S&P Global Ratings, respectively, took certain negative rating actions, including downgrades with respect to their credit ratings of us and our debt, as discussed in Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d Downgrades may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital. Therefore, any further downgrade by any of the principal credit agencies may exacerbate these difficulties. There can be no assurances that our credit ratings will not be further downgraded in the future, whether as a result of deteriorating general economic conditions, a more protracted downturn in the housing industry, failure to successfully implement our operating strategy, the adverse impact on our results of operations or liquidity position of any of the above, or otherwise.\nOur business is seasonal in nature and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. The construction of a customer\u2019s home typically begins after signing the agreement of sale and can take six to nine months or more to complete. Weather-related problems, typically in the fall, winter and early spring, can delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability. In addition, delays in opening communities could have an adverse effect on our sales and revenues. Due to these factors, our quarterly operating results will likely continue to fluctuate.\nOur success depends on the availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to fund such investments.\nOur success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for land that is suitable for residential development and the availability of undeveloped land and improved lots for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive overbidding on land and lots, geographical or topographical constraints and restrictive governmental regulation. Should suitable land opportunities become less available, our ability to implement our strategies and operational actions would be limited and the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced, which would reduce revenue and profits. In addition, our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases. We may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our significant debt obligations, which require substantial cash resources.\nRaw material and labor shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities. For example, manufacturers increased the price of drywall in 2013 by approximately 20% as compared to the prior year, and there is a potential for significant future price increases. In addition, we contract with subcontractors to construct our homes. Therefore, the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability, skill, and cost of our subcontractors. Delays or cost increases caused by shortages and price fluctuations, including as a result of inflation, could harm our operating results, the impact of which may be further affected depending on our ability to raise sales prices to offset increased costs. We have experienced some labor shortages and increased labor costs over the past few years, including fiscal 2017 during which we also experienced increased materials and construction costs. It is uncertain whether these shortages will continue as is, improve or worsen. If rising labor and house construction costs substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers we may be limited in our ability to raise home sale prices, which may result in lower gross margins.\nWe rely on subcontractors to construct our homes and should our homes not be properly constructed, it may be costly.\nWe engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes. Despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors failed to properly construct our homes. The occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law. The cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors and insurers.\nChanges in economic and market conditions could result in the sale of homes at a loss or holding land in inventory longer than planned, the cost of which can be significant.\nLand inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders. We must continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for expansion into new markets and for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets. We incur many costs even before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development of a land parcel when we acquire it, these may include costs of preparing land, finishing and entitling lots, installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes. The market value of undeveloped land, buildable lots, and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions. In the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned. In the case of land options, we could choose not to exercise them, in which case we would write-off the value of these options. Inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market. The assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly. While we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the reporting period, these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change. See Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d For example, during more recent years, we did not have significant land option write-offs or impairments; however, during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we decided not to exercise many option contracts and walked away from land option deposits and predevelopment costs, which resulted in land option write-offs of $24.3 million, $13.2 million, and $45.4 million, respectively. Also, in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, as a result of the difficult market conditions, we recorded inventory impairment losses on owned property of $77.5 million, $122.5 million and $614.1 million, respectively. If market conditions worsen, additional inventory impairment losses and land option write-offs will likely be necessary.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, and accordingly, regional factors affecting home sales and activities in these markets may have a large impact on our results of operations.\nWe presently conduct a significant portion of our business in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, which subjects us to risks associated with the regional and local economies of these markets. Home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time, particularly as a result of slow economic growth. These markets may also depend, to a degree, on certain sectors of the economy and any declines in those sectors may impact home sales and activities in that region. For example, to the extent the oil and gas industries, which can be very volatile, are negatively impacted by declining commodity prices, climate change, legislation or other factors, it could result in reduced employment, or other negative economic consequences, which in turn could adversely impact our home sales and activities in Texas. Furthermore, precarious economic and budget situations at the state government level may adversely affect the market for our homes in the affected areas. Events impacting these markets could also negatively affect the other markets in which we operate. If home prices and sales activity decline in one or more of the markets in which we operate, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause almost all of our customers require mortgage financing, increases in interest rates or the decreased availability of mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes, lower demand for our products, limit our marketing effectiveness, and limit our ability to fully realize our backlog.\nVirtually all of our customers finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing. Increases in interest rates (or the perception that interest rates will rise, including as a result of government actions), increases in the costs to obtain mortgages or decreases in availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs and cash required to close on mortgages to potential home buyers. Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing. This could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts generally include a financing contingency. Financing contingencies permit the customer to cancel his/her obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates, including financing arranged or provided by us, is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract. This contingency period is typically four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the sales contract.\nStarting in 2007, many lenders have been significantly tightening their underwriting standards, even above the minimum standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD/FHA, and subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer being made available in the marketplace. If these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected, which will adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we believe that the availability of mortgage financing, including Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, and FHA/VA financing, is an important factor in marketing many of our homes. The maximum size of mortgage loans that are treated as conforming by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was reduced in the past few years, which could further weaken home sales in general as mortgages may become more expensive and, if conforming loan limits are further reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, in 2010 HUD tightened FHA underwriting standards and the mortgage environment remains constrained. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our sales. Further, if we are unable to originate mortgages for any reason going forward, our customers may experience significant mortgage loan funding issues, which could have a material impact on our homebuilding business and our consolidated financial statements.\nIncreases in cancellations of agreements of sale could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog reflects agreements of sale with our home buyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from our home buyer for each home, which is reflected in our backlog, and we generally have the right to retain the deposit if the home buyer does not complete the purchase. In some situations, however, a home buyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local law, his or her inability to obtain mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates (including financing arranged or provided by us), his or her inability to sell his or her current home, or our inability to complete and deliver the home within the specified time. At October 31, 2017, including unconsolidated joint ventures, we had a backlog of signed contracts for 2,437 homes with a sales value aggregating $1.1 billion. If mortgage financing becomes less accessible, or if economic conditions deteriorate, more home buyers may cancel their agreements of sale with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in the after-tax costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally are, under current tax law, deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to limitations under current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers. The \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" which was recently signed into law includes provisions which would impose significant limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. For instance, under the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", the annual deduction for real estate taxes and state and local income or sales taxes would generally be limited to $10,000. Furthermore, through the end of 2025, the deduction for mortgage interest would generally only be available with respect to acquisition indebtedness that does not exceed $750,000. The loss or reduction of these homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law changes were enacted without any offsetting legislation, would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes, including ours. In addition, increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in insurance premiums can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and can have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid.\nWe currently operate through a number of unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest. At October 31, 2017, we had invested an aggregate of $115.1 million in these joint ventures, including advances and a note receivable to these joint ventures of $22.4 million. In addition, as part of our strategy, we intend to continue to evaluate additional joint venture opportunities.\nThese investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. There are a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition, development, and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures, and if market conditions become more challenging, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms. Over the past few years, it has been difficult to obtain financing for newly created joint ventures. In addition, we lack a controlling interest in these joint ventures and, therefore, are usually unable to require that our joint ventures sell assets or return invested capital, make additional capital contributions, or take any other action without the vote of at least one of our venture partners. Therefore, absent partner agreement, we will be unable to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash.\nHomebuilders are subject to a number of federal, local, state, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land, the homebuilding, sales, and customer financing processes and the protection of the environment, which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and homebuilding, sales and customer financing processes, including zoning, density, building standards and mortgage financing. These laws and regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding. In light of recent developments in the home building industry and the financial markets, federal, state, or local governments may seek to adopt regulations that limit or prohibit homebuilders from providing mortgage financing to their customers. If adopted, any such regulations could adversely affect future revenues and earnings. In addition, some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved, and others may approve, slow-growth or no-growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas. Approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets. Any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings.\nWe also are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we have owned or developed or currently own or are developing (\u201cenvironmental laws\u201d). The particular environmental laws that apply to a site may vary greatly according to the community's site, for example, due to the community, the environmental conditions at or near the site, and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and/or other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity. In addition, noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations or other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments may result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses.\nFor example, in March 2013, we received a letter from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) requesting information about our involvement in a housing redevelopment project in Newark, New Jersey that a Company entity undertook during the 1990s. We understand that the development is in the vicinity of a former lead smelter and that tests on soil samples from properties within the development conducted by the EPA show elevated levels of lead. We also understand that the smelter ceased operations many years before the Company entity involved acquired the properties in the area and carried out the re-development project. We responded to the EPA\u2019s request. In August 2013, we were notified that the EPA considers us a potentially responsible party (or \u201cPRP\u201d) with respect to the site, that the EPA will clean up the site, and that the EPA is proposing that we fund and/or contribute towards the cleanup of the contamination at the site. We began preliminary discussions with the EPA concerning a possible resolution but do not know the scope or extent of the Company\u2019s obligations, if any, that may arise from the site and therefore cannot provide any assurance that this matter will not have a material impact on the Company. The EPA requested additional information in April 2014 and again in March 2017 and the Company has responded to its information requests.\nWe anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future. For example, for a number of years, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been engaged in rulemakings to clarify the scope of federally regulated wetlands, which included a June 2015 rule many affected businesses contend impermissibly expanded the scope of such wetlands that was challenged in court, stayed, and remains in litigation, and a proposal in June 2017 to formally rescind the June 2015 rule and reinstate the rule scheme previously in place while the agencies initiate a new substantive rulemaking on the issue. It is unclear how these and related developments, including at the state or local level, ultimately may affect the scope of regulated wetlands where we operate. Although we cannot reliably predict the extent of any effect these developments regarding wetlands, or any other requirements that may take effect may have on us, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in policies, rules, and regulations and their interpretations and application.\nSeveral other homebuilders have received inquiries from regulatory agencies regarding the potential for homebuilders using contractors to be deemed employers of the employees of their contractors under certain circumstances. Contractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the industry; however, if regulatory agencies reclassify the employees of contractors as employees of homebuilders, homebuilders using contractors could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of their contractors.\nProduct liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly.\nAs discussed in Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d in the ordinary course of business we are involved in litigation from time to time, including with home owners associations, home buyers and other persons with whom we have relationships. As a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims, including moisture intrusion and related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business. Such claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. For example, in the past we have received construction defect and home warranty claims associated with, and we were involved in a multidistrict litigation concerning, allegedly defective drywall manufactured in China (\u201cChinese Drywall\u201d) that may have been responsible for noxious smells and accelerated corrosion of certain metals in certain homes we have constructed. We remediated certain homes in response to such claims and settled the litigation.\nWith regard to certain general liability exposures such as product liability claims, construction defect claims and related claims, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process is highly judgmental and subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. Furthermore, after claims are asserted for construction defects, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which assertions of such claims will expand geographically. For example, we are party to litigation in New Jersey concerning alleged defects in construction (see Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2017). In addition, the amount and scope of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited, and this coverage may be further restricted and become more costly. If we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against such claims, if the costs associated with such claims significantly exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or if our insurers do not pay on claims under our policies (whether because of dispute, inability, or otherwise), we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results.\nOur financial results could also be adversely affected if we were to experience an unusually high number of claims or unusually severe claims. Our insurance companies have the right to review our claims and claims history, and do so from time to time, and could decline to pay on such claims if such reviews determine the claims did not meet the terms for coverage. For example, we had a dispute with XL, our insurance carrier for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 through the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010, regarding coverage issues pertaining to the fiscal 2006 insurance policy. Specifically, XL maintained that the Company had not satisfied its aggregate retention of $21 million for fiscal 2006 and therefore the Company\u2019s submitted claims in excess of the aggregate retention for fiscal 2006 were not reimbursable by XL under the policy terms (XL disputed the Company\u2019s interpretation of certain definitions within the policy and therefore was denying coverage). The dispute was resolved as a result of mediation pursuant to which XL made a payment in October 2015 to the Company to fully settle coverage for its 2006 and 2007 insurance policy years. The Company is therefore self-insured for those policy years (policy years 2008 through 2010 remain in effect and to date, the Company has not met the aggregate retention for any of these other policy years). Additionally, we may need to significantly increase our construction defect and home warranty reserves as a result of insurance not being available for any of the reasons discussed above, such claims or the results of our annual actuarial study.\nMortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties.\nOur financial services segment originates mortgages, primarily for our homebuilding customers. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, nonrecourse basis, although we remain liable for certain limited representations, such as fraud, and warranties related to loan sales. Accordingly, mortgage investors have in the past and could in the future seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties. We believe there continues to be an industry-wide issue with the number of purchaser claims in which purchasers purport to have found inaccuracies related to sellers\u2019 representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. We have established reserves for potential losses. While we believe these reserves are adequate for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional expense may be incurred. There can be no assurance that we will not have significant liabilities in respect of such claims in the future, which could exceed our reserves, or that the impact of such claims on our results of operations will not be material. Further, an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages.\nWe compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources, which could hurt future earnings.\nWe compete not only for home buyers but also for desirable properties, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor often within larger subdivisions designed, planned, and developed by other homebuilders. Our competitors include other local, regional, and national homebuilders, some of which have greater sales and financial resources or more established relationships with suppliers and subcontractors in the markets in which we operate. In addition, we compete with other housing alternatives, such as existing homes and rental housing. In the homebuilding industry, we compete primarily on the basis of reputation, price, location, design, quality, service and amenities. Our financial services segment competes with other mortgage bankers, primarily on the basis of fees, interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products.\nThe competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry together with current market conditions have, and could continue to, result in:\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nincreased selling incentives;\n\u25cf\nlower sales;\n\u25cf\ndelays in construction; or\n\u25cf\nimpairment of our ability to implement our strategies and operational actions.\nAny of these problems could increase costs and/or lower profit margins.\nOur future growth may include additional acquisitions of companies that may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve expected benefits.\nAcquisitions of companies have contributed to our historical growth and may again be a component of our growth strategy in the future. In the future, we may acquire businesses, some of which may be significant. As a result of acquisitions of companies, we may need to seek additional financing and integrate product lines, dispersed operations, and distinct corporate cultures. These integration efforts may not succeed or may distract our management from operating our existing business. Additionally, we may not be able to enhance our earnings as a result of acquisitions. Our failure to successfully identify and manage future acquisitions could harm our operating results.\nOur controlling stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over us.\nMembers of the Hovnanian family, including Ara K. Hovnanian, our chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer, have voting control, through personal holdings, the limited partnership and the limited liability company established for members of Mr. Hovnanian\u2019s family and family trusts of Class A and Class B common stock that enabled them to cast approximately 57% of the votes that could be cast by the holders of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock combined as of October 31, 2017. Their combined stock ownership enables them to exert significant control over us, including power to control the election of the Board of Directors and to approve matters presented to our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also make some transactions, including mergers or other changes in control, more difficult or impossible without their support. Also, because of their combined voting power, circumstances may occur in which their interests could be in conflict with the interests of other stakeholders.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nBased on past impairments and our current financial performance, we generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of $1.6 billion through the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nSection 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company.\nIf we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our stock, including purchases or sales of stock between 5% shareholders, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built-in losses would be subject to the limitations of Section 382. Depending on the resulting limitation, a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them. A limitation imposed under Section 382 on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn August 2008, we announced that the Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net operating loss carryforwards and built-in losses under Section 382 of the Code, and on December 5, 2008, our stockholders approved the Board\u2019s decision to adopt the Rights Plan. The Rights Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring 4.9% or more of our outstanding Class A common stock (any such person an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d), without the approval of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Plan, if and when they become exercisable, each right would entitle its holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth of a share of the Company\u2019s Series B Junior Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $35.00 per share (the \u201cpurchase price\u201d). The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days after a public announcement by us that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person and (ii) 10 business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by a person or group for 4.9% of the Class A common stock (the \u201cdistribution date\u201d). If issued, each fractional share of Series B Junior Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. However, prior to exercise, a right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including without limitation any dividend, voting or liquidation rights. After the distribution date, each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a right and payment of the purchase price, that number of shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, as the case may be, having a market value of two times the purchase price. After the distribution date, our Board of Directors may exchange the rights (other than rights owned by an Acquiring Person which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock, or a fractional share of Series B Junior Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of Hovnanian\u2019s preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per right (subject to adjustment).\nIn addition, on December 5, 2008, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to restrict certain transfers of our common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss carryforwards and built-in losses under Section 382 of the Code. Subject to certain exceptions pertaining to pre-existing 5% stockholders and Class B stockholders, the transfer restrictions in the amended Certificate of Incorporation generally restrict any direct or indirect transfer (such as transfers of the Company\u2019s stock that result from the transfer of interests in other entities that own the Company\u2019s stock) if the effect would be to: (i) increase the direct or indirect ownership of the Company\u2019s stock by any person (or public group) from less than 5% to 5% or more of the Company\u2019s stock; (ii) increase the percentage of the Company\u2019s stock owned directly or indirectly by a person (or public group) owning or deemed to own 5% or more of the Company\u2019s stock; or (iii) create a new \u201cpublic group\u201d (as defined in the applicable United States Treasury regulations).\nUtility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIn prior years, the areas in which we operate in California have experienced power shortages, including periods without electrical power, as well as significant fluctuations in utility costs. We may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such power shortages and outages and utility rate fluctuations continue. Furthermore, power shortages and outages and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes. Our operations may be adversely affected if further rate fluctuations and/or power shortages and outages occur in California, the Northeast or in our other markets.\nGeopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nGeopolitical events, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities throughout the world or health pandemics, may have a substantial impact on the economy, consumer confidence, the housing market, our associates and our customers. Further, perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars and related geopolitical risks have created many economic and political uncertainties. If any such events were to occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the loss of key management personnel or if we fail to attract qualified personnel.\nTo a significant degree, our future success depends on the efforts of our senior management, many of whom have been with the Company for a significant number of years, and our ability to attract qualified personnel. Our operations could be adversely affected if key members of our senior management leave the Company or if we cannot attract qualified personnel to manage growth in our business.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology, digital telecommunications and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. Our computer systems, including our backup systems, are subject to damage or interruption from computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, power outages, security breaches (including through data-theft and cyber-attack), usage errors by our associates and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. If our computer systems and our backup systems are breached, compromised, damaged, or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information, including information about our business partners and home buyers, which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues and could damage our reputation.", "PERMNO": 65285, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "HOV"}
