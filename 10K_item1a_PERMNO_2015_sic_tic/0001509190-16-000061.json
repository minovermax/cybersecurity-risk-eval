{"cik": "1509190", "company": "ARATANA THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the important risks described below, as well as the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company in the pet therapeutics industry transitioning into a commercial enterprise, with a limited operating history. Biopharmaceutical product development in the pet therapeutics industry is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We currently have a product pipeline with multiple products under development including two biologics, BLONTRESS and TACTRESS, for which we received full licenses from the USDA, but for which we do not expect to receive significant revenues. We expect to receive FDA approval for, product candidates GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA in 2016 and subsequently to commence commercialization.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in December 2010. In addition, as an early stage company, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $38.8 million and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $6.9 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $152.0 million and we had $86.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize them if they are approved by the FDA, or for our biologic products, the USDA. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe may require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product portfolio expansion, product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, a majority of our resources have been dedicated to the in-licensing, acquisition and research and development of our current product candidates. Completing the development and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates will require substantial funds. We also have an active in-licensing effort focused on identifying human therapeutics for development and commercialization as pet therapeutics. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future for the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with identifying potential product candidates, licensing or acquisition payments, conducting target animal studies, completing other research and development, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any target animal study is uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any of our current or future product candidates. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will allow us to fund our operations and our debt obligations through December 31, 2016. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing any of our current or future product candidates and conducting target animal studies;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of any milestone payments or royalties we must pay pursuant to our current or future license agreements or collaboration agreements;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our current or future product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe upfront and other payments, and associated costs, related to identifying, acquiring and in-licensing new product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nwhether we acquire any other companies, assets, intellectual property or technologies in the future;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to partner with companies with an established commercial presence in Europe and/or other countries to provide our products in that market;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities for any of our current or future product candidates, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our current and future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements and the potential costs and financial terms to amend or terminate such relationships or other arrangements, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nwhether we are required to repay grant amounts that we received from foreign, U.S. and/or state governments;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent rights, including litigation costs.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour target animal studies or other development activities for our current or future product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to launch and/or commercialize any of our current or future product candidates; or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nour in-licensing and acquisition efforts and expansion of our product portfolio.\nWe recognized substantial intangible asset impairment losses in the third quarter of 2015 and may be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment losses in the future.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $43.4 million related to our intangible assets BLONTRESS, TACTRESS, AT-007 and AT-011. At December 31, 2015, we had $15.1 million of remaining intangible assets on our balance sheet, compared to $62.3 million at December 31, 2014. We could experience material impairment losses in the future. Certain factors, including negative pre-clinical study results and reduced market potential, might have a negative impact on the carrying value of our intangible assets. For example, with respect to BLONTRESS and TACTRESS, which as of December 31, 2015 have carrying values of $5.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, these products are expected to continue to be available or become available to oncologists, but we believe the revenue and gross margin opportunity for these first generation monoclonal antibodies will be very modest. Therefore, we are pursuing second generation monoclonal antibodies and other product concepts in lymphoma which are intended to deliver break-through benefits. We intend to build awareness of monoclonal antibody therapy with BLONTRESS and TACTRESS and effectively bridge to second generation product candidates which are several years away. We also intend to improve the gross margins for any second generation products. If we determine that we are likely to be unsuccessful in developing product candidates with break-through benefits at an economic gross margin, we would consider phasing out BLONTRESS and TACTRESS depending on product volumes, and fully impairing the value of these intangible assets. The process of testing intangible assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management including expected future profitability, cash flows and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions and estimates, and our intangible assets may become further impaired in future periods. This would in turn have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate further, or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain and more costly. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our development programs, commercialization efforts, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon plans for our target animal studies and/or the commercialization of any approved products. In addition, difficult economic conditions may limit pet owners\u2019 discretionary funds, which could in turn limit their ability to purchase pet therapeutics. A tight spending climate for pet owners could negatively affect our ability to generate revenues from any approved products. Further, we rely on third-parties for several aspects of our business, including contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and licensors of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npharmaceutical compounds. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in difficult credit markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors and other collaborators. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, or if they become bankrupt or insolvent, our agreements with such parties may terminate, and our business and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.\nThe terms of our credit facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nEffective as of October 16, 2015, we and Vet Therapeutics, Inc., and together with us, the borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, with Pacific Western Bank, or Pacific Western, as collateral agent and the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the lenders, including Pacific Western and Oxford Finance, LLC, that is secured by substantially all of the borrowers\u2019 personal property other than intellectual property. The outstanding principal balance under the loan agreement was $35.0 million under the term loan facility and $5.0 million under the revolving facility at December 31, 2015.\nThe loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limits or restrictions on the borrowers\u2019 ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, make certain investments, merge, consolidate, make an acquisition, enter into certain licensing arrangements and dispose of certain assets. The loan agreement also contains customary events of default that entitle the lenders to cause the borrowers\u2019 indebtedness under the loan agreement to become immediately due and payable. The events of default, some of which are subject to cure periods, include, among others, a non-payment default, a covenant default, the occurrence of a material adverse change, the occurrence of an insolvency, a material judgment default, defaults regarding other indebtedness and certain actions by governmental authorities. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, an additional default interest rate equal to 4% per annum will apply to all obligations owed under the loan agreement and would provide Pacific Western, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loan agreement, including foreclosure against our properties securing the loan agreement, including our cash.\nThe loan agreement requires that the borrowers receive unrestricted net cash proceeds of at least $45.0 million from partnering transactions and/or the issuance of equity securities from October 16, 2015 to October 16, 2016. The loan agreement also requires that the borrowers have at least three products fully USDA- or FDA-approved for commercialization by December 31, 2016. Additionally, the loan agreement requires that the borrowers maintain certain minimum liquidity (approximately $20.0 million) at all times. At December 31, 2015, the borrowers were in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and ability to raise additional sources of cash, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring our debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we desire to refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nAlthough we have two fully approved products, we are substantially dependent on the success of our current product candidates.\nWe currently have two products approved for commercial distribution, BLONTRESS and TACTRESS, however we do not expect to receive significant revenues from sales of these products. To date, we have invested substantial efforts and financial resources in the in-licensing, research and development of GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA, which, prior to our acquisition of Vet Therapeutics and Okapi Sciences, were our only product candidates and are still in development. We expect to receive FDA approval for GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA in 2016, and begin commercializing product candidates GALLIPRANT in 2016 and ENTYCE in late-2016 or shortly thereafter and NOCITA in 2016.\nOur near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our company and to enter into strategic collaborations and generate revenue, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of our current product candidates. The development and commercial success of our current product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CVM, the USDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or the applicable EU Member State national competent authorities, the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and for biologics, the potency and purity of our product candidates and to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and Europe;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements, the financial terms of such agreements and the potential costs and financial terms to amend or terminate such relationships or other arrangements, including litigation costs;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects, including a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our commercialization efforts, including the effectiveness of marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations, whether performed solely by us or in collaboration with others;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe ability of us or our third-party manufacturers to manufacture supplies of any of our current or future product candidates and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully launch commercial sales of our current product candidates, assuming CVM, USDA or EMA approval is obtained, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to our product candidates and avoid third-party patent interference, third-party initiated and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d)-initiated administrative patent proceedings or patent infringement claims;\n\u2022\nour success in educating veterinarians and pet owners about the benefits, administration and use of our product candidates; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nacceptance of our product candidates as safe and effective by veterinarians, pet owners and the animal health community.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate revenue through the sale of our product candidates. If we are not successful in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and the value of your investment could substantially decline.\nThe development of our biologic product candidates is dependent upon relatively novel technologies and compliance with complex regulatory requirements.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Vet Therapeutics, we are developing biologics, including animal antibodies, for pets. Identification, optimization and manufacturing of therapeutic animal biologics is a relatively new field in which unanticipated difficulties or challenges could arise. While many biologics have been approved for use in humans, very few have been approved for use in animals, except for vaccines. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics, the development, manufacturing and sale of which are subject to regulations that are often as complex and extensive as the regulations applicable to other small molecule products. We anticipate that our animal biologics will continue to be regulated by the USDA, rather than CVM, and the regulatory standards that the USDA may require for novel biologics may be more difficult to satisfy than we anticipate.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our existing or future product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization efforts and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of development, and our business currently depends entirely on their successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization. With the exception of BLONTRESS and TACTRESS, we currently have no products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our other current or future product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of pet therapeutics products are subject to extensive regulation by the CVM, the USDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, whose regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our products in the United States until we receive approval of a New Animal Drug Application, or NADA, from the CVM or a full product license from the USDA with respect to our biologic products, or in Europe until we receive approval from the European Commission or applicable EU State national competent authorities.\nEven if we receive approval of an NADA, USDA product license or foreign regulatory filing for our product candidates, the CVM, the USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication than we originally requested, and the CVM or the USDA may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nEven if our current or future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain CVM, USDA, EMA or other regulatory approvals, our current or future products may not achieve market acceptance among veterinarians and pet owners, and may not be commercially successful. For example, BLONTRESS and TACTRESS both received a full license from the USDA, however, we impaired the value of these assets during the third quarter of 2015, and do not anticipate that these products will generate significant revenues, as recent studies indicate that these products are not as specific to the targets as expected and have uncertain clinical benefits. Market acceptance of any of our current or future products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe safety of our products as demonstrated in our target animal studies;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022\nthe indications for which our products are approved;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe acceptance by veterinarians and pet owners of the products as safe and effective treatments;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe consistent and reliable supply and manufacture of the products;\n\u2022\nthe proper training and administration of our products by veterinarians;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments, including generic medicines and products approved for use by humans that are used off label;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of veterinarians and pet owners;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe willingness of pet owners to pay for our treatments, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators.\nBecause we expect sales of GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these product candidates to gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success would adversely affect our financial results and require us to seek additional financing.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions. The overall integration of any acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of acquired companies include, among others:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining any acquired businesses with our company;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining previously-established relationships with licensors and licensees.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of any acquired businesses are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies or growth opportunities that we expect. For example, we acquired BLONTRESS and TACTRESS in connection with our acquisition of Vet Therapeutics, Inc. and, in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $20.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in relation to these intangible assets. It is possible that we will fully impair the value of these assets in the future. Other expected benefits of our acquisitions may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nIn addition, through acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nDevelopment of pet therapeutics is an expensive and lengthy process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results.\nDevelopment of pet therapeutics is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. To gain approval to market a pet therapeutic for a particular species of pet, we must provide the CVM, the USDA or foreign regulatory authorities, as applicable, with data from animal safety and effectiveness studies that adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of that product in the target animal for the intended indication applied for in the NADA, product license or other regulatory filing. We rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties to ensure the proper and timely conduct of most of our studies and development efforts and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure can occur at any time during the development process. Success in prior target animal studies or in the treatment of human beings with a product candidate does not ensure that our target animal studies will be successful and the results of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndevelopment efforts by other parties may not be indicative of the results of our target animal studies and other development efforts. Product candidates in our studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite showing such results in initial data or previous human or animal studies conducted by other parties. Even if our studies and other development efforts are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nOnce our target animal studies commence, we may experience delays in such studies and other development efforts and we do not know whether planned studies will begin on time, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. Pet therapeutics studies can be delayed or discontinued for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nreach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ncomplete target animal studies due to deviations from study protocol;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\naddress any safety concerns that arise during the course of testing;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\naddress any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nadd new study sites; or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of formulated drug for use in studies.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or terminate any development efforts for our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our development efforts will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of our development efforts may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and will likely continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis, Inc.; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Merial, the animal health division of Sanofi S.A.; Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early stage animal health companies such as Nexvet, Jaguar Animal Health, Parnell Pharmaceuticals, VetDC and Kindred Bio that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.\nIf approved, we expect that GALLIPRANT will face competition from Rimadyl, marketed by Zoetis; generic Carprofen and Deramaxx, marketed by Elanco; Previcox, marketed by Merial; Metacam, marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim; and generic Meloxicam. Nexvet is developing a monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain. Parnell is developing Zydax, an injectable product for osteoarthritis, a direct competitor for GALLIPRANT. We expect ENTYCE to enter a new market where there are no veterinary approved products for appetite stimulation. However, we are aware that some veterinarians utilize mirtazapine, a human generic antidepressant to attempt to treat inappetence. We expect NOCITA will compete primarily with the Coxibs and injectable buprenorphine and anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, which is not approved for non-human use but is widely used by veterinarians. Recuvyra fentanyl transdermal solution received approval in the United States and Europe for control of postoperative pain from surgical procedures in dogs. We are also unaware of any approved products for the treatment of lymphoma in dogs, although we are aware of a number of biotechnology companies such as Nexvet, Karyopharm and VetDC that are developing products for the treatment of lymphoma in dogs, including some that have received MUMS designation. We expect that BLONTRESS and TACTRESS will face competition from human generic chemotherapies, though we are unaware of any companies that are actively promoting this use. Among the larger animal health companies, Merial is developing a lymphoma vaccine based on technology similar to their melanoma vaccine. We know of no direct competitor for AT-014 in osteosarcoma.\nMany of our competitors have substantially more resources than we do, including both financial and technical resources. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of animal health medicines.\nOur competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors\u2019 products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our compounds, complete target animal studies and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nexpect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position.\nIf we are not successful in identifying, licensing or acquiring, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nAlthough we will continue to focus on the continued development and potential approval of our current product candidates, a key element of our strategy is to identify, license or acquire, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products to serve the pet therapeutics market. We derive potential pet therapeutic product candidates from molecules and compounds discovered or developed as part of human biopharmaceutical research. We expect to enter into license arrangements with third parties to provide us with rights to human health compounds for purposes of our business. Such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement. If we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to access human health-generated molecules and compounds to conduct research and development on cost-effective terms, our ability to develop new products could be limited. In some instances, human biopharmaceutical companies may be unwilling to license us their products or compounds for development as pet therapeutics because of perceived regulatory and commercial risks, including the risk that the FDA could delay or halt an ongoing human development trial if the same compound, when studied in animals, produces an unexplained adverse event or death, and the risk that, if the same compound is developed for humans and pets, and the human version is priced significantly higher than the pet version, which is usually the case, human patients would attempt to use the cheaper animal version of the drug. Even if we successfully identify and license potential product candidates, we may still fail to yield product candidates for development and commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects in pets or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by veterinarians, pet owners and the pet therapeutics community.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing our current and future product candidates.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific and commercial personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our current or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our current or future product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management team as well as our senior scientists and sales and marketing team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our current or future product pipeline, completion of our planned development efforts or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn addition, we could experience difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the animal health fields is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely completely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture the supplies for the development of our small molecule and antiviral product candidates and we intend to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of any of these approved drug candidates.\nWith respect to our small molecules and antiviral programs, we do not currently have, nor do we currently plan to acquire, the internal infrastructure or capability to manufacture the formulated drug for use in the conduct of our target animal studies. We also lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a scale necessary for commercialization. We will need to rely on contract manufacturers to provide commercial supplies of the formulated drugs for all small molecule and antiviral products. For example, for AT-003, we have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Pacira to supply the formulated drug. If this supply agreement terminates for any reason, or Pacira does not produce the necessary quantities, we may be unable to arrange for\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nalternative supply of AT-003 in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our agreement with Pacira may terminate due to factors outside of our control, including if Pacira ceases to manufacture, for any reason, the formulated drug. With respect to AT-003 and our other product candidates, any delay in our ability to identify and contract with a replacement or an initial third-party contract manufacturer, as applicable, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have an adverse impact upon our business.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drugs may be subject to inspections by one or more regulatory bodies. We do not control the manufacturing processes used by, and we are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers to comply with cGMP for the manufacture of both active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control and quality assurance practices and to engage qualified personnel. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and complies with regulatory requirements, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the CVM, the USDA or the EMA does not approve our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities used for the manufacture of our product candidates, or if any such agency withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would adversely impact our ability to develop and obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe and our third-party contractors are continuing to refine and improve the manufacturing process for our product candidates, certain aspects of which are complex and unique. We may encounter difficulties with new or existing manufacturing processes. In addition, to manufacture our product candidates in the quantities that we believe would be required to meet anticipated market demand, our third-party manufacturers may need to increase manufacturing capacity, which could involve significant challenges and may require additional regulatory approvals. Neither we nor our third-party manufacturers may successfully complete any manufacturing scale-up activities required to increase existing manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, or at all.\nFurthermore, we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain any raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, and we do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials. If there is a disruption to our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 relevant operations, we will have no other means of producing our product candidates until they restore the affected facilities or we or they procure alternative manufacturing facilities or raw materials. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture product candidates on a timely basis.\nBiologics manufacturing is difficult and costly, and may not be commercially viable.\nWe acquired a USDA-licensed manufacturing facility for our biologic products as part of our acquisition of Vet Therapeutics. Manufacturing of our pet biologics is a relatively new field in which unanticipated difficulties or challenges could arise. For example, we announced in February 2015 that there was a potential quality issue in the manufacturing of one serial lot of BLONTRESS. We completed an investigation into the serial lot and identified an environmental contaminant in certain of the vials in the lot, and in agreement with the USDA, that serial lot was destroyed. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of technologies that we may need to develop. Such manufacturing requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose as well as sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics can also be costly to manufacture. Manufacturing biologics may be more technically challenging, time-consuming and expensive than we anticipate.\nDuring 2016, we plan to manufacture BLONTRESS and TACTRESS at our USDA-licensed facility in San Diego. We perform all steps for production including cell line development, assay development, production in batch mode, fill and finish, release of products and packaging. There is no assurance that we will be able to manufacture these or other biologics at full commercial scale and at an economical cost. We may experience supply constraints or other supply challenges as we attempt to increase manufacturing capacity. We may encounter difficulties with new or existing manufacturing processes and we may experience delays, may be required to seek additional regulatory approvals and/or may incur significant expense in scaling up the capacity and operations to meet anticipated demand for future biologics products. If there is a disruption to our relevant operations in San Diego, we will have no other means of producing our products until operations are restored or we transition to alternative manufacturing facilities. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture products on a timely basis.\nWe currently rely on third parties to conduct our target animal studies and certain other development efforts. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our current or future product candidates.\nWe currently do not conduct our target animal studies, and we rely on CROs and/or academic institutions to conduct these studies. The third parties with whom we contract for the execution of our studies play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our studies, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the development plan and protocol. Moreover, the CVM, the USDA and EMA require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, or good laboratory practices, or GLPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of our studies to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, the execution of target animal studies and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced requires coordination among various parties. If the third parties conducting our target animal studies do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our development protocols or cGCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult and costly, and our target animal studies may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the regulatory approval for and commercialization of the product candidate being tested in any such study may be delayed or require us to utilize additional resources.\nOur ability to market our product candidates, if approved, will be limited to use for the treatment of the indications for which they are approved, and if we want to expand the indications for which we may market our product candidates, we will need to obtain additional CVM, USDA or EMA approvals, which may not be granted.\nWe are seeking CVM approval in the United States for AT-001 directed at treating osteoarthritis pain and inflammation in dogs and for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with degenerative joint disease in cats, AT-002 for the appetite stimulation of for dogs and management of weight loss in chronically diseased cats, and AT-003 for the treatment of post-operative pain in dogs and cats. In addition, we have received a full license from the USDA for BLONTRESS as an aid for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma in dogs and for TACTRESS as an aid for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma in dogs. If our product candidates are approved, we may market or advertise them only for the treatment of indications for which they are approved, which could limit their adoption by veterinarians and pet owners. We may attempt to develop, promote and commercialize new treatment indications and protocols for our product candidates in the future, but we cannot predict when or if we will receive the approvals required to do so. In addition, we would be required to conduct additional target animal studies to support our applications, which would utilize additional resources and may produce results that do not result in CVM, USDA or EMA approvals. If we do not obtain additional CVM, USDA or EMA approvals, our ability to expand our business will be limited.\nWe currently have a small commercial organization. If we are unable to expand sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell significant amounts of our current or future product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nWe currently have a small commercial organization. In order to commercialize any of our current or future product candidates in the United States and any jurisdictions outside the United States, including GALLIPRANT, ENTYCE and NOCITA, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. We expect to expand our direct sales organization in the United States, complemented by distributors, to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time-consuming. Because we have limited prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pet therapeutics, there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. Outside of the United States we intend to collaborate with companies with an established commercial presence to market our products in those locations. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current product candidates or any future product candidates that receive regulatory approval. If we are not successful in commercializing any of our current or future product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more distributors, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nSince our initial public offering in June 2013, we have grown from approximately 15 full-time employees to approximately 60 full-time employees as of March 10, 2016. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and target animal studies, continue our development activities and commercialize any of our current or future product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nmanage our target animal studies and other development efforts effectively;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nAny failure to successfully manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively carry out our target animal studies, continue our development activities and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are incurring significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is expected to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs a publicly-traded company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur when we were a private company, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market, have created uncertainty for public companies and increased our costs and time that our Board of Directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 has subjected us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including increased possibility of legal proceedings.\nOur management determined that our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 should be restated due to errors relating to the valuation of the intangible asset BLONTRESS in connection with our October 2013 acquisition of Vet Therapeutics, Inc. As a result of the restatement, we have become subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including possible shareholder or other litigation, in connection with the restatement.\nManagement previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended 2013, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nOur management is required to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal controls relating to the valuation of the intangible asset BLONTRESS in connection with our October 2013 acquisition of Vet Therapeutics, Inc., and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 was ineffective. We remediated this material weakness in the second quarter of 2015.\nIn the future, we may identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and we may not be able to remediate them in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm, if such a report is required. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could materially adversely affect our business, reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our common stock, adversely affect the price of our common stock and limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nChanges in distribution channels for pet therapeutics could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, pet owners typically purchase their pet therapeutics directly from veterinarians. Pet owners increasingly could purchase pet therapeutics from sources other than veterinarians, such as Internet-based retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of parasiticides and vaccines in recent years. Pet owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on Internet-based animal health information. Because we expect to market our pet prescription products through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in visits to veterinarians by pet owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, pet owners may substitute human health products for pet therapeutics if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nLegislation has also been proposed in the United States, and may be proposed in the United States or abroad in the future, that could impact the distribution channels for our pet products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their pet therapeutics directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other pet therapeutics or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the American Veterinary Medical Association has long-standing policies in place to encourage this practice.\nOver time, these and other competitive conditions may increase our reliance on Internet-based retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our pet products. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConsolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. If this trend towards consolidation continues, these customers could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, for federal and state income tax purposes of $44.2 million and $42.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset our future taxable income, if any. Our federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031, and our state NOLs begin to expire in 2020. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges our analysis that our existing NOLs will not expire before utilization due to previous ownership changes, or if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to use our NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, even if we attain profitability. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation, due to significant complexity and related costs associated with such a study.\nGeneric products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.\nWe may face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic (or non-patented) alternatives to any of our products. We will depend on patents to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. As of December 31, 2015 we had licensed an extensive portfolio of issued patents or pending patent applications relating to our AT-001, AT-002 and AT-003 products covering various composition of matter claims as well as methods of treatment and methods of manufacturing our products. In addition, as part of our Vet Therapeutics acquisition, we acquired a patent family related to the speciesization of antibodies that covers all Vet Therapeutics products. We also acquired a patent family related to antibody constant domain regions and uses thereof, which also covers all Vet Therapeutics products. We also acquired pending patent applications that cover specific canine monoclonal antibodies directed to various targets, including an allowed U.S. patent directed to the canine CD-52 development antibody. Further, as part of our acquisition of Okapi Sciences, we acquired two patent applications that cover formulations of AT-006 and commercially-viable methods of making the active ingredient of AT-006. We also have a license to an issued U.S. patent that covers the active ingredient of AT-007. We also have patent applications in the United States, Europe and other countries that cover therapeutic uses of AT-007. Finally, we have in-licensed a patent portfolio for AT-008 that covers the composition and use of AT-008 through 2024 and 2027, respectively.\nThe protection afforded to our patents, which varies from country to country, is limited by the scope and applicable terms of our patents and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. As a result, we may face competition from lower-priced generic alternatives to many of our products. Generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing, and generic products are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. In addition, private label products may compete with our products. If pet therapeutics customers increase their use of new or existing generic or private label products, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur pet therapeutics are subject to unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns, which may harm our reputation.\nUnanticipated safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to pet therapeutics, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability, and other claims. For example, although BLONTRESS and TACTRESS both received a full license from the USDA, we impaired the value of these assets during the third quarter of 2015 and do not anticipate that these products will generate significant revenues, as recent studies indicate that these products are not as specific to the targets as expected and have uncertain clinical benefits. In addition, we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products, and pet therapeutics generally, by our customers, veterinarians and end-users, and such concerns may harm our reputation. These concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or security breaches.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and future contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any system failure or security breach by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including data from our target animal studies, intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or future studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nour business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe currently own two issued patents and several patent applications, license the issued patents covering our small molecule product candidates and have limited rights to prosecute and enforce those licensed patents.\nWe currently own one issued patent related to the speciesization of antibodies that covers all Vet Therapeutics products, an issued patent related to antibody constant domain regions and uses thereof, which also covers all Vet Therapeutics products, a patent related to canine monoclonal antibodies directed to canine CD-52 and a filed patent application that specifically covers our canine monoclonal antibodies directed to canine CD-20, as well as pending related applications and foreign counterpart patents and applications.\nWe also own a patent family relating to our AT-002 product candidate, covering a method of treating inappetence using AT-002. Applications in this patent family are pending in Australia, Argentina, Canada, China, European Patent Office, Japan and Taiwan. We cannot assure you that a patent based on any of these patent applications will ever be issued. We do not own any patents or patent applications relating to AT-001 or AT-003. We have exclusive license agreements in the field of animal health with RaQualia, pursuant to which we license key intellectual property relating to AT-001 and AT-002, and with Pacira pursuant to which we license key intellectual property relating to AT-003. Under each of the license agreements, RaQualia and Pacira retain ownership over the licensed patents and patent applications and retain control over the maintenance and prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications. In the case of AT-003, we have no control over the manner in which Pacira chooses to maintain or prosecute its patent and patent applications and have no right to continue to prosecute any patents or patent applications that Pacira elects to abandon. We do not have the right to enforce patents licensed from Pacira against any third-party infringement, although we have certain limited rights to request our licensor to enforce such patents against infringement.\nIf we cannot obtain ownership of or adequate license rights to issued patents covering our product candidates or we cannot prosecute or enforce licensed patents, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are essential to our business.\nWe are party to license agreements for our product candidates that are essential to our business. These license agreements impose various payment and performance obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, RaQualia or Pacira, as applicable, may have the right to terminate the relevant license agreement, in which event we would not be able to develop or commercialize AT-001, AT-002 and/or AT-003, as the case may be.\nIf we lose such license rights, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected. We may enter into additional licenses in the future and if we fail to comply with obligations under those agreements, we could suffer adverse consequences.\nWe may not own any intellectual property rights we develop with respect to AT-003 or be able to share our licensed patent rights to AT-003 with future collaborators.\nOur license agreement with Pacira contains certain obligations and restrictions on our ability to develop and commercialize AT-003. All of the intellectual property rights that we develop with respect to AT-003 will be owned by Pacira upon termination of this license agreement. If we wish to enter into any collaboration agreements relating to AT-003, Pacira has the right to approve all of our sublicenses. Furthermore, Pacira has a right of first negotiation for shared commercialization rights to AT-003 in the United States. These restrictions may impair or delay our ability to engage third parties to commercialize AT-003.\nWe may become subject to third parties\u2019 claims alleging infringement of patents and proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate our patents or proprietary rights, which would be costly, time-consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the field of pet therapeutics, as well as patent challenge proceedings, including interference and administrative law proceedings before the U.S. PTO and oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Recently, under U.S. patent reform laws, new procedures including inter party review and post grant review have been implemented. As stated below, the novel implementation of such reform laws presents uncertainty regarding the outcome of challenges to our patents in the future. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future product candidates will not infringe existing or future patents. Because we have not conducted a formal freedom to operate analysis for patents related to our products, we may not be aware of patents that have already been issued that a third party might assert are infringed by one of our current or future product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for eighteen months or more after filing, there also may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing any of our current or future product candidates.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be subject to third-party claims in the future against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees, milestone payments, royalties or other payments. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, infringement and other intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. PTO to determine the priority of invention. Third parties may also attempt to initiate reexamination, post grant review or inter party review of our patents in the U.S. PTO. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities, which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to any of our current or future product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our current product candidates and our development programs.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, including pet therapeutics, as such patents provide protection without regard to any particular method of use or manufacture. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, veterinarians may recommend that pet owners use these products off label, or pet owners may do so themselves. Although off-label use may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Method of manufacturing patents protect a specific way to make a product and do not prevent a third party from making the product by a different method and then using the product for our uses. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications will be considered patentable by the U.S. PTO and courts in the United States, or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries.\nThe strength of patents in the field of pet therapeutics involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our products or our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we own, in-license or pursue with respect to any of our current or future product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize any of our current or future product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, the period of time during which we could market any of our current or future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for patent applications in which claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the U.S. PTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For patent applications containing a claim not entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law due to the passage of the America Invents Act, which brings into effect significant changes to the U.S. patent laws that have yet to be well defined, and which introduces new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents. A primary change under this reform is creating a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in the United States, which requires us to minimize the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. We cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties, including our collaborators and contract manufacturers, who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or had access to our proprietary information, nor that our agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntrade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, or patents that may be issued to us in the future, or the patents of our licensors that are licensed to us. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, if we or one of our future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our current product candidates, or one of our future products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the U.S. PTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nLitigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be unsuccessful, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing owned or licensed patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. PTO, the European Patent Office and various other foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have pending trademark applications for our company name in the United States and certain other countries, and we have pending trademark applications in the United States for certain product candidates, and we have pending trademark applications for these product candidates in certain other countries; however, registration is not yet complete for certain of these filings, and failure to finally secure these registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have two pending trademark applications and have obtained four trademark registrations for our company name and design marks in the United States, and we have eleven pending foreign trademark applications for our company name and design marks and we have obtained eleven foreign registrations for these marks, although we cannot make assurances that the trademarks will become registered. We have nine pending trademark applications in the United States for commercial trade names for our current product\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncandidates, and we have obtained seven U.S. registrations for these candidates, and we have seventeen pending foreign applications and twenty-nine foreign registrations for these candidates, although we cannot make assurances that the trademarks applications will be registered. During trademark registration proceedings, we have in the past and may in the future receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the U.S. PTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings have in the past and may in the future be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Additionally, we may need to enforce our trademark rights against third parties and expend significant additional resources to enforce such rights against infringements. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the CVM, the USDA or the EMA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The CVM typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the CVM, the USDA or the EMA object to any of our proposed proprietary product names (which they have done in the past done and may do in the future), we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the CVM, the USDA or the EMA.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, including in Europe where our Aratana NV facilities are located. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology, pharmaceutical or animal health companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is uncertain, requires us to utilize significant resources, and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of pet therapeutics are subject to extensive regulation by the CVM, the USDA or the EMA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market any of our current or future product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NADA from the CVM or a product license from the USDA. Obtaining approval of an NADA from CVM or a product license from the USDA can be an uncertain process that requires us to utilize significant resources. The CVM, the USDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of any of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nwe are unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CVM, the USDA, the EMA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that the product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe CVM, the USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation of data from our target animal studies and other development efforts;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that the product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh any safety or other actual or perceived risks;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe CVM, the USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may require additional studies;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022\nthe CVM, the USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not approve of the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of our current and future product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe CVM, the USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities, or the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the CVM, USDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may significantly change in a manner rendering the data from our studies insufficient for approval.\nFailure to comply with CVM and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, withdrawal of approved products from the market, product seizure or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and refusal to approve pending NADAs or product licenses or supplements to approved NADAs or product licenses.\nRegulatory approval of an NADA or supplement NADA, or of a product license, is not guaranteed, and the approval process requires us to utilize significant resources, may take several years, and is subject to the substantial discretion of the CVM, the USDA or the EMA. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat studies, or perform additional studies. If any of our current or future product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in our studies, or for any other reason does not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing CVM, USDA or EMA obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, will be subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements and could be subject to other restrictions. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products could result in significant penalties.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or any of our collaborators receive for any of our current or future product candidates may be subject to conditions of approval or limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, or may contain requirements for potentially costly surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the CVM, the USDA or the EMA approves any of our current or future product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP, GLP and GCP, for any studies that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters or holds on target animal studies;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nrefusal by the CVM, the USDA or the EMA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe CVM\u2019s, USDA\u2019s or the EMA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nIn order to market any product outside of the United States, including in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, separate regulatory approvals are required. More concretely, in the EEA, pet therapeutics can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (\u201cMA\u201d). Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent national authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional studies and testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain CVM or USDA approval. Animal studies conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the CVM or USDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the CVM or the USDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining CVM or USDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis and, even if we do file them, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nIf approved, any of our current or future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the CVM, USDA and regulatory authorities in other countries and, if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing any of our current or future products, regulations of the CVM, the USDA and of the regulatory authorities in other countries require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the CVM, USDA and regulatory authorities in other countries could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms with respect to pet therapeutics may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our current or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products. In addition, CVM and USDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the CVM and USDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States or in other countries may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our current or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of certain products; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur research and development relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional regulations.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on pet therapeutics, the evaluation of our existing and new products in animals is required to register our products. Animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our research and development, and by extension our operating results and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile with trading prices ranging from $2.56 per share to $29.32 per share since our initial public offering in June 2013. The price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations, including due to results from, and any delays in, our current and future target animal studies. For example, on September 25, 2015, following our announcement that we do not believe that BLONTRESS or TACTRESS will capture the desired lymphoma market opportunity, the price of our common stock fell from $17.49 on September 24, 2015 to $10.67 on September 25, 2015, a 39% reduction. The price of our common stock could be volatile in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and others, such as:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our current or future product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe termination of any of our existing license agreements;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to future licensing or development agreements;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ndelays in the commercialization of our current or future product candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nacquisitions and sales of new product candidates, technologies or businesses;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and supply issues related to our current or future product candidates for our development programs and commercialization;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new product candidates, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nany major changes in our Board of Directors or management;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nnew legislation in the United States or other countries relating to the sale or pricing of pet therapeutics;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nCVM or USDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or future products;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the animal health sector and in the pet therapeutics market;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nlow daily trading volumes in our stock; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, or the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, may experience extreme volatility unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action or other litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) of 2018, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the sale of any shares of our common stock at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nissuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to influence matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 10, 2016, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 50% of our voting stock. These stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. For example, these stockholders may be able to influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approvals of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that stockholders may believe to be in their best interest.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include the following:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.", "PERMNO": 13966, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PETX"}
