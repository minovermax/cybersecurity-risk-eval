RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully review and consider the risks described below and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K before evaluating our business or making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Additional risks which we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on our business. Please also see the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1.\nIn Fiscal 2014 we came to an agreed settlement with the SEC, stemming from an investigation of accounting irregularities. As part of this settlement we agreed to a series of corporate governance reforms, which are to be independently verified in Fiscal 2015. If we are unable to fully implement the corporate governance reforms, we could face additional enforcement actions by the SEC or other governmental or regulatory bodies, as well as additional shareholder lawsuits, all of which could have significant negative financial or operational implications.\nOn April 16, 2012, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that our Board had determined the existence of certain accounting irregularities beginning approximately during the second calendar quarter of 2007 and continuing in periods subsequent thereto (the \u201cAccounting Irregularities\u201d). We brought the Accounting Irregularities to the attention of the SEC in a letter dated April 16, 2012. On June 18, 2012, we received written notice that the SEC had initiated a private investigation into the Accounting Irregularities, to determine whether any persons or entities had engaged in any possible violations of the federal securities laws. On June 2, 2014, we received notice of the entry of an agreed final judgment by the Honorable Judge Jane Boyle (the \u201cAgreed Final Judgment\u201d) in Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-01909-B, entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. DGSE Companies Inc., et. al., filed on May 27, 2014 in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \u201cCivil Action\u201d). We consented to the Agreed Final Judgment prior to the filing of the Civil Action by the SEC. The Agreed Final Judgment was entered in connection with the conclusion of the investigation against DGSE by the SEC regarding the Accounting Irregularities.\nIn connection with the Agreed Final Judgment and as remedial measures in connection with the Accounting Irregularities, we have agreed to undertake certain corporate governance reforms, many of which are already completed or in process (the \u201cCorporate Governance Reforms\u201d). The Corporate Governance Reforms include the appointment of two new independent directors to the Board, establishing the position of a Lead Independent Director on the Board and establishing reasonable term limits for members of the Board, among other reforms. We have further agreed to engage a consultant satisfactory to the SEC to confirm implementation of the Corporate Governance Reforms. If we are unable to fully implement the Corporate Governance Reforms, or if the independent consultant does not fully confirm our implementation, we may be the subject of additional enforcement actions and further lawsuits, which could be debilitating. The costs of such investigations and of defending lawsuits could be significant and could exceed the amount of any available insurance coverage we have, and we may not have sufficient resources in the future to satisfy such costs. These matters may continue for some time, and we have no way of anticipating when or how they may be resolved. As a result of the recent investigation and settlement, as well as any future investigations or lawsuits, we could face loss of reputation, decline in confidence from investors, fall in the market price for our shares, inability to acquire capital and failure to continue as a going concern.\nThe Loan Agreement with NTR is collateralized by a general security interest in our assets. If we were to default under the terms of the credit facility, NTR would have the right to foreclose on our assets.\nIn 2012 we entered into that certain Loan Agreement, dated July 19, 2012, by and between NTR and us (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which NTR agreed to provide us a guidance line of revolving credit in an amount up to $7,500,000. In connection with the Loan Agreement, we granted a security interest in the securities and the respective personal property of each of our subsidiaries. If we were to default under the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, NTR would have the right to accelerate any indebtedness outstanding and foreclose on our assets in order to satisfy our indebtedness. Such a foreclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial position. On February 25, 2014, we entered into a one-year extension of the Loan Agreement with NTR, extending the termination date to August 1, 2015, and on February 4, 2015, we entered into an additional two-year extension, extending the termination date to August 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement was $2,303,359.\nThe voting power in our company is substantially controlled by a small number of stockholders, which may, among other things, delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or a takeover attempt, even if such events may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nElemetal, including its affiliate NTR, is our largest shareholder. Elemetal owns 4,695,042 shares of our Common Stock, representing 38.3% of our total outstanding shares of Common Stock. Consequently, Elemetal is in a position to significantly influence any matters that are brought to a vote of the shareholders, including, but not limited to, the election of members of our Board and any action requiring the approval of shareholders, including any amendments to our governing documents, mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership also may delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Elemetal. These transactions might include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of Common Stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nWe have resolved a sales tax dispute with the State of Texas, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all terms of the resulting payment agreement.\nThe Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas (the \u201cTexas Comptroller\u201d) asserted in December 2010 that we owed approximately $4.4 million in unpaid sales and use taxes tax for the period from March 1, 2006 through November 30, 2009 (the \u201cSales Tax Deficiency\u201d), plus penalty of approximately $440,000 and accrued interest, as of December 17, 2010, of approximately $600,000. We submitted a request for redetermination to the Texas Comptroller by letter dated January 13, 2011. By letter dated August 25, 2011, the Texas Comptroller stated that our request for a redetermination hearing had been granted. On July 15, 2014, we received final notice from the Texas Comptroller of its consent to the negotiated payment agreement (the \u201cPayment Agreement\u201d) to pay amounts due by us under the Texas Comptroller\u2019s final decision in connection with the 2010 Sale Tax Audit (the \u201cDecision\u201d), as more fully discussed in our Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 17, 2014.\nThe Decision dismissed our Petition for Redetermination and concluded the 2010 Sales Tax Audit based on an agreement between the Texas Comptroller and DGSE, whereby we have agreed to pay: (i) tax due of $800,397; (ii) a 10% penalty; and (iii) interest. The total amount due as of the date of the Payment Agreement was approximately $1.1 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Payment Agreement, we paid an initial payment of $325,000 in July 2014, and in August 2014 began making monthly payments of $47,000, which will continue for an 18-month period, until all agreed tax amounts, penalty and accrued interest due under the Decision are paid. Interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding tax due, until all amounts are paid.\nIn Fiscal 2014 we recognized an expense of $104,958, to bring the total accrual in this matter to the approximately $1.1 million due, which is expected to cover all tax, penalty and interest through the term of the Payment Agreement. As of December 31, 2014 our remaining obligation under the Payment Agreement is $569,958.\nThere is no guarantee that we will have the liquidity to fulfill the terms of the Payment Agreement. If we were unable to make all payments required by the Payment Agreement, we could face additional interest or penalties from the Texas Comptroller, or other punitive actions, up to and including seizure of our assets or forfeiture of our Texas sales tax permit, which could negatively affect our profitability, business operations, reputation and investor confidence.\nIn the past, our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures related thereto have been deficient. Although we have taken significant remedial measures, our previous deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our investors\u2019 confidence in our reported financial information, and there is no guarantee that our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures will not fail in the future.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. In the past, our internal controls and procedures have failed. The remedial measures taken by us may not be sufficient to regain the confidence of investors or any loss of reputation, which could in turn affect our finances and operations. Our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our business have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. If there is a failure in any of our internal controls and procedures, we could face investigation or enforcement actions by the SEC and other governmental and regulatory bodies, litigation, loss of reputation and investor confidence, inability to acquire capital and other material adverse effects on our finances and business operations.\nThe market for precious metals is inherently unpredictable.\nBullion and scrap products are purchased and sold based on current market pricing for precious metals. This bullion and scrap inventory is subject to market value changes created by the underlying commodity markets. We periodically enter into futures contracts in order to hedge our exposure against changes in market prices. There are several national and international factors which are out of our control but which may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion business. These factors include but are not limited to: the policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private mint supply and other factors. If we misjudge the commodity markets underlying the bullion inventory, our bullion business could suffer adverse consequences. Substantially lower precious metals prices could negatively affect our ability to continue purchasing significant volumes of precious metal scrap products which could negatively affect our profitability.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. or in other key markets, and the resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer confidence and spending, including, but not limited to: general economic and business conditions; wages and employment levels; volatility in the stock market; home values; inflation; consumer debt levels; availability and cost of consumer credit; economic uncertainty; solvency concerns of major financial institutions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; fuel and energy costs and/or shortages; tax issues; and general political conditions, both domestic and abroad.\nAdverse economic conditions, including declines in employment levels, disposable income, consumer confidence and economic growth could result in decreased consumer spending that would adversely affect sales of consumer goods, particularly those, such as many of our products, that are viewed as discretionary items. In addition, events such as war, terrorism, natural disasters or outbreaks of disease could further suppress consumer spending on discretionary items. If any of these events should occur, our future sales could decline by driving up commodities prices, particularly gold.\nWe face intense competition.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and we compete with numerous other companies, many of which are larger and have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources. Our products compete on a number of bases, including price. Significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect our operations through a decrease in the number and dollar volume of sales.\nFor all of our products and services, we compete with a number of comparably sized and smaller firms, as well as a number of larger firms throughout the United States. Many of our competitors have the ability to attract customers as a result of their reputation and through their industry connections. Additionally, other reputable companies may decide to enter our markets to compete with us. These companies may have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. If these companies are successful in entering the markets in which we participate or if customers choose to go to our competition, we may attract fewer buyers and our revenue could decrease.\nOur wholesale and jewelry business is seasonal, with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons, so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur wholesale and jewelry sales are seasonal by nature. Our sales are traditionally greater during significant local holidays that occur in late fall, winter or early spring. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during these seasons depends upon the general level of retail sales at such times, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. Given the timing of our annual seasonality, inclement weather can at times pose a substantial barrier to consumer retail activity, and have a material negative impact on our store traffic. If events or circumstances were to occur that negatively impact consumer spending during such holiday seasons, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and results of operations.\nIf we misjudge the demand for our products, high inventory levels could adversely affect future operating results and profitability.\nConsumer demand for our products can affect inventory levels. If consumer demand is lower than expected, inventory levels can rise causing a strain on operating cash flow. If the inventory cannot be sold through our wholesale or retail outlets, additional write-downs or write-offs to future earnings could be necessary. Conversely, if consumer demand is higher than expected, insufficient inventory levels could result in unfulfilled customer orders, loss of revenue and an unfavorable impact on customer relationships. In particular, volatility and uncertainty related to macro-economic factors make it more difficult for us to forecast customer demand in our various markets. Failure to properly judge consumer demand and properly manage inventory could have a material adverse effect on profitability and liquidity.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements and our ability to secure financing and credit could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe require continued access to capital, and a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Similarly, if actual costs to build new stores significantly exceed planned costs, our ability to build new stores or to operate new stores profitably could be materially restricted. Credit and equity markets remain sensitive to world events and macro-economic developments. Therefore, our cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or to refinance long-term obligations as they become payable. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies\u2019 short and long-term debt ratings which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely also increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A significant increase in the costs we incur in order to finance our operations may have a material adverse impact on our business results and financial condition.\nInterest rate fluctuations could increase our interest expense.\nInterest rates could rise which would, in turn, increase our cost of borrowing or could make it difficult or impossible for us to secure financing.\nA failure in our information systems could prevent us from effectively managing and controlling our business or serving our customers.\nWe rely on our information systems to manage and operate our stores and business. This includes our phone system, website, point of sale application, accounting package and other systems. Each store is part of an information network that permits us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances daily and report revenues and expenses in a timely manner. Any disruption in the availability of our information systems could adversely affect our operation, the ability to serve our customers and our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate management and other skilled employees.\nOur future success and growth depend on the continued services of our key management and employees. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or any other key employee or contractor could materially affect our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining them. There are a limited number of people with knowledge of, and experience in, our industry. We do not have employment agreements with many of our key employees. We do not maintain life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our loss of key personnel, especially without advance notice, or our inability to hire or retain qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on sales and our ability to maintain our technological edge. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to retain our key management and skilled personnel, or that we will be able to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, members of our management may be involved in business activities involving our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may distract such members from our day-to-day operations. Such distractions could have a material adverse effect on sales as a result of a failure to respond to market conditions on a timely basis.\nWe have not paid dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid Common Stock dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current business plan provides for the reinvestment of earnings in an effort to complete development of our technologies and products, with the goal of increasing sales and long-term profitability and value. In addition, our revolving credit facility with NTR currently restricts, and any other credit or borrowing arrangements that we enter into in the future may restrict or limit, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to new and existing corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the Corporate Governance Reforms, we face corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Exchange. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. We cannot ensure that we will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting and similar matters. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could subject us to investigation and enforcement actions and could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and the value and liquidity of our securities.\nOur websites may be vulnerable to security breaches and similar threats, which could result in our liability for damages and harm to our reputation.\nDespite the implementation of network security measures, our websites are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by internet users. These occurrences could result in our liability for damages, and our reputation could suffer. The circumvention of our security measures may result in the misappropriation of customer or other confidential information. Any such security breach could lead to interruptions and delays and the cessation of service to our customers and could result in a decline in revenue and income.\nFluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities, particularly gold, which accounts for the majority of our merchandise costs, could adversely impact our earnings and cash availability.\nWhile jewelry manufacturing is a major driver of demand for gold, management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly driven by investment transactions which have resulted in significant changes in its cost over the past decade. Our cost of merchandise and potentially our earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly increase or decrease.\nAn inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability. Historically jewelry retailers have been able, over time, to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs. However, in general, particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices. There is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable, so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur. In addition, any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customer.\nA significant portion of our profit is generated from the buying and selling of pre-owned jewelry or other precious metal based products. Significant price fluctuations in precious metals, especially downward, can have a severe impact on this part of our business, as people are less likely to sell these products to us if they believe that their merchandise is being undervalued, or if they believe the value is uncertain.\nThe conflict mineral diligence process, the results from that process and the related reporting obligations could increase costs, adversely affect our reputation and adversely affect our ability to obtain merchandise.\nIn August 2012, the SEC, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, issued final rules, which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals, including gold, from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The gold supply chain is complex and, while our management believes that the rules only cover less than 1% of annual worldwide gold production (based upon current estimates), the final rules require certain jewelry retailers and manufacturers that file with the SEC to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin of the statutorily designated minerals that are used in products sold by us. Jewelry retailers or manufacturers who meet certain criteria were required to file certain reports with SEC beginning in May 2014, disclosing their due diligence measures related to country of origin, the results of those activities, and related determinations. In conjunction with legal counsel, we have determined that we do not have sufficient control over manufacturing of any of our products to be included in the group of companies required to provide conflict minerals disclosure and reporting.\nIf our sourcing processes should change or if there is a determination that our current practices should be covered by the conflict minerals reporting and disclosure guidelines, we would need to implement significant additional measures to comply with these rules. We cannot be certain of the costs that might be associated with such regulatory compliance. The final rules also cover tungsten, which is contained in a small portion of items that are sold by us. Other minerals, such as diamonds, could be added to those currently covered by these rules. We may incur reputational risks with customers and other stakeholders if, due to the complexity of the global supply chain, we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin for the relevant metals. Also, if the responses of parts of our supply chain to the verification requests were adverse, it could harm our ability to obtain merchandise and add to compliance costs.", "PERMNO": 10028, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "ELA"}
