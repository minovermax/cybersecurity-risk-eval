{"cik": "1517228", "company": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nBNS Acquisition Risks\nThe completion of the integration of the BNS business (the Acquired Business) into our business will be difficult, costly and time-consuming and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the BNS Acquisition (the Acquisition) may take longer to realize or may not be realized at all.\nWe currently expect to realize annual cost savings of more than $200 million by 2018 related to the Acquisition. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to complete the integration of the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the Acquired Business into our business, or if such integration is successfully accomplished, that such integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully complete the integration within a reasonable time frame, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully complete the timely integration of information technology systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete the effective integration of operations, standards, controls, policies and procedures, and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns of both our business and the Acquired Business during the process of integrating legacy CommScope and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Acquired Business may have liabilities we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating the Acquired Business\u2019 workforce into the legacy CommScope workforce may result in production disruptions or be more costly than anticipated;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business.\nWe are relying on TE Connectivity (TE) to provide a wide range of services required to operate a significant portion of the Acquired Business under Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) and such reliance is expected to continue at least through most of 2017.\nDue to the high level of integration of the Acquired Business with the remainder of TE\u2019s business, it is highly complex and time-consuming to separate the Acquired Business and effectively integrate it into our business. As a result, we are dependent on TE to continue to perform elements of such critical functions as information technology, finance, logistics and operations for portions of the Acquired Business under TSAs. It may be late in 2017 or later before we are able to assume all of these functions and discontinue all of the support provided by TE under the TSAs.\nWhile operating under these TSAs, we are exposed to various risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncosts of operating the Acquired Business may be greater than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nservices provided under TSAs may not meet our requirements in a timely and effective manner; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to make operational changes or to get information necessary to realize the anticipated synergies.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending for data and communication networks by customers or end-users of our products and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 or end-users\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile or hard to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of capital spending in the communications industry and, therefore, our sales and earnings, including: competing technologies; general economic conditions; seasonality of outside deployments; timing and adoption of the global rollout of new technologies; customer specific financial or general market conditions; availability and cost of capital; governmental regulation; demands for network services; competitive pressures, including pricing pressures; acceptance of new services offered by our customers; industry consolidation; and real or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from a limited number of key customers and channel partners.\nWe derived 23% of our 2016 consolidated net sales from our top three direct customers and channel partners, including distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. Our largest distributor, Anixter International Inc., accounted for 11% of our 2016 consolidated net sales. The concentration of our net sales among these three customers and other key customers and channel partners subjects us to a variety of risks that could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nlower sales resulting from the loss of one or more of our key customers or channel partners;\n\u2022\nrenegotiations of agreements with key customers or channel partners resulting in materially less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties experienced by one or more of our key customers, channel partners or our channel partners\u2019 end customers, resulting in reduced purchases of our products and/or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable balances;\n\u2022\nreductions in inventory levels held by channel partners and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) which may be unrelated to purchasing trends by the end customer;\n\u2022\nconsolidations in the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end-user markets resulting in delays in purchasing decisions, reduced or delayed purchases by the merged businesses or increased leverage to reduce prices or renegotiate terms;\n\u2022\nnew or proposed laws or regulations affecting the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end-user markets resulting in reduced capital spending; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of borrowing or otherwise raising capital and/or reductions in the amount of debt or equity capital available to the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries or other key end-user markets resulting in reduced capital spending.\nAdditionally, the risks above may be further increased to the extent that we have significant indirect sales to one or more end-users of our products (who may also be direct customers) with such indirect sales taking place through numerous channel partners and/or OEMs.\nWe generally have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our channel partners, OEMs or other customers, and our contracts with these parties generally do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers and end-users of our products, and any significant reduction in sales to these customers and end-users of our products, including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their businesses with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face competitive pressures with respect to all of our major products.\nCompetition in our industry depends on a number of factors, including the level of customer capital spending, innovative solution offerings, quality and timing of the introduction of new products, customer service and pricing. In each of our major product groups, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, some of which have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources or lower operating costs. They may also have broader product lines and market focus. This gives many of these enterprises a competitive advantage to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets over the long term. Further, our industry is consolidating and the combination of any of our competitors could further increase these advantages and result in competitors with an even broader market presence.\nSome competitors may also be able to bundle their products and services together to meet the needs of a particular customer and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide which may cause us to lose sales opportunities and revenue. Competitors\u2019 actions, such as price reductions or the introduction of new innovative products, and the use of exclusively price driven Internet auctions by customers have caused lost sales opportunities in the past and may cause us to lose sales opportunities in the future. The rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors against whom we may not be able to compete successfully. In addition, if any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business would be negatively affected. Changes in trade policies (including some of those contemplated by the new administration in the U.S.) could decrease the price competitiveness of our products and/or increase our operating costs.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we are unable to compete in any of our markets at the same level as we have in the past or are forced to reduce the prices of our products in order to continue to be competitive, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which our customers operate may negatively impact our business.\nThe telecommunications and cable television industries are subject to significant and changing federal and state regulation, both in the U.S. and other countries, including regulations regarding the \u201cOpen Internet\u201d or \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d We have benefited from government programs that encourage spending on our products. Changes to the way in which internet service providers are regulated, changes in government programs in our industry or uncertainty regarding future changes could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending, which could decrease demand for our products.\nOperational Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and to adapt to technological changes and develop, implement and market product innovations.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require significant investments in research and development in order to improve the capabilities of our products and develop new products that will meet the needs of our customers. There can be no assurance that our investments in research and development will yield marketable product innovations.\nWe may not be successful in our ongoing innovation efforts if, among other things, our products are not cost effective; brought to market in a timely manner; compliant with evolving industry standards; accepted in the market; or recognized as meeting customer requirements. If we are not successful in our ongoing innovation efforts, these failures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not stay current with product life cycle developments, our business may suffer.\nA significant portion of our revenues are dependent on the commercial deployment of technologies based on 2G, 3G and 4G wireless communications equipment and products. If we are not able to support our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner as they advance from 2G or 3G networks to 4G networks or as they expand the capacity of their networks, our business will suffer. If we do not have competitively priced, market accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G wireless communications systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a significant portion of our current revenue is also partially dependent on the core copper enterprise business and we could experience unfavorable financial impacts if this business erodes at a significantly increasing rate beyond current forecasts and we do not have adequate fiber-based solutions for our customers.\nIf our products, including material purchased from our suppliers, experience quality or performance issues, our business may suffer.\nOur business depends on delivering products of consistently high quality. To this end, our products are tested for quality both by us and our customers. Nevertheless, many of our products are highly complex and testing procedures used by us and our customers are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, once deployed, our products may fail to perform as expected. Performance issues could result from faulty design, defective raw materials or components purchased from suppliers, problems in manufacturing or installation errors. We have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues in the future. In some cases, recall of some or all affected products, product redesigns or additional capital expenditures may be required to correct a defect. In addition, we generally offer warranties on most products, the terms and conditions of which depend upon the product subject to the warranty. In some cases, we indemnify our customers against damages or losses that might arise from certain claims relating to our products. Future claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant or systemic product failure could also result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products as well as reputational damage.\nOur business depends on effective management information systems.\nWe rely on effective management information systems for critical business operations, for strategic business decisions and to maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace. We rely on our enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing; manufacturing; shipping; inventory control; purchasing and supply chain management; human resources; and financial reporting. We also rely on management information systems to produce information for business decision-making and planning and to support e-commerce activities.\nOur primary current major management information systems initiative is the completion of the integration of the BNS business into our legacy CommScope management information systems. If we are unable to successfully complete the integration, we could encounter difficulties that may cause us to experience a material adverse impact on our business, lapses in internal controls over financial reporting or an inability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nOur focus on the integration of the BNS business also creates the risk that we are not focusing enough on other major management information system initiatives, such as expanding our digital platform to accommodate the changing buying habits of our customers. Failure to maintain an adequate digital platform to produce information for business decision-making and support e-commerce activities could have a material adverse impact on our business through lost sales opportunities.\nThe hardware and software of our management information systems infrastructure is aging. If we are unable to maintain our IT infrastructure to support critical business operations and to produce information for business decision-making activities, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business or an inability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by exposing us to various liabilities, disrupting our delivery of products and services and damaging our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business. We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for storing proprietary company information about our products and intellectual property, as well as for processing customer orders, manufacturing and shipping products, invoicing our customers, tracking inventory, supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation, paying our employees and vendors, and otherwise running our business. Additionally, we and others on our behalf store \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d with respect to employees, vendors, customers and others. Despite implemented security measures, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In particular, unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of confidential or sensitive information, the deletion or modification of records or interruptions in our operations. Any such events, including those involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential or sensitive information of the Company or our customers, vendors, employees or others, whether by us or a third party, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties; expose us to liabilities to our customers, employees, vendors, third parties or governmental authorities; disrupt our delivery of products and services; and have a negative impact on our reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our integrated global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe internally produce, both domestically and internationally, a portion of the components used in our finished products. Disruption of our ability to produce at or distribute from these facilities due to failure of our manufacturing infrastructure, information technology outage, labor disturbances, fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism, shipping interruptions or some other catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapacity constraints, with respect to our internal facilities and/or existing or new contract manufacturers, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If we do not have sufficient production capacity, either through our internal facilities or independent contract manufacturers, to meet customer demand for our products, we may experience lost sales opportunities and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSupply Chain Risks\nOur dependence on commodities subjects us to cost volatility and potential availability constraints.\nOur profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price and availability of certain raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. The principal raw materials and components we purchase are made of metals such as copper, steel, aluminum or brass; plastics and other polymers; and optical fiber. Fabricated copper, steel and aluminum are used in the production of coaxial and twisted pair cables and polymers are used to insulate and protect cables. Prices for copper, steel, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers, derived from oil and natural gas, have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions and other factors. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases or a failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In an environment of falling commodities prices, we may be unable to sell higher-cost inventory before implementing price decreases, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain raw materials and components.\nFor certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, optical fiber, circuit boards and other electronic components, we are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers.\nOur key suppliers have in the past experienced and could in the future experience production, operational or financial difficulties, or there may be global shortages of the raw materials or components we use. Our inability to find sufficient sources of supply on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe also source many of our components from international markets. Any changes in the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade, including changes to certain of these laws or policies contemplated by the new administration in the U.S., is a risk to us. To the extent there are unfavorable changes imposed by the U.S and/or retaliatory actions taken by trading partners, such as the addition of new tariffs or trade restrictions, we may experience adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nIf contract manufacturers we rely on encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, including labor disturbances or geopolitical risks, and if acceptable alternative suppliers cannot be identified, we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may not fully realize anticipated benefits from past or future acquisitions or equity investments.\nWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth of our business might be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses, products or technologies. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of our past or future acquisitions and equity investments, we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved. There are significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business, including, but not limited to: successfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; integrating the sales organizations; maintaining and increasing the customer base; retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors; integrating management information systems and inventory, accounting and research and development activities; and addressing operating losses that may exist related to individual facilities or product lines. Further, many acquisitions involve new or developing technologies that may not achieve the expected results.\nIn addition, we might not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. We might spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or investment targets but not complete the transaction.\nAny future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, issuances of debt, incurrence of transaction and integration costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results. See \u201cBNS Acquisition Risks\u201d for details related to that acquisition.\nWe may sell or discontinue one or more of our product lines, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture or discontinuance of one or more of those product lines. Any such divestiture or discontinuance could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDivestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line; the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur; possible delays in closing any sale; the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business; unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our information technology and other operating systems; and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Expected cost savings may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to a fixed cost structure, and we may experience varying success in the timely reduction of fixed costs or transferring of liabilities previously associated with the divested or discontinued business.\nDifficulties may be encountered in the realignment of manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products.\nWe periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities in order to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to strengthen our long-term competitive position. The implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities.\nThere are significant risks inherent in the implementation of these initiatives, including our failure to ensure the following: there is adequate inventory on hand or production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities; there is no decrease in product quality as a result of shifting capacity; adequate raw material and other service providers are available to meet the needs at the new production locations; equipment can be successfully removed, transported and re-installed; and adequate supervisory, production and support personnel are available to accommodate the shifted production.\nIn the event manufacturing realignment initiatives are not successfully implemented, we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs as well as customer relations problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to undertake additional restructuring actions in the future.\nWe have previously recognized restructuring charges in response to slowdowns in demand for our products and in conjunction with implementation of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency of our operations. Most recently, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to support the BNS integration which included the closure of certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and various other workforce reductions. Restructuring actions as a result of the BNS acquisition are expected to continue and may be material. As a result of other changes in business conditions and other developments, we may need to initiate additional restructuring actions that could result in workforce reductions and restructuring charges, which could be material.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.6 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. See Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details of our indebtedness. We had no outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility and approximately $441.1 million in borrowing capacity, reflecting a borrowing base of $466.1 million and $25.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time and may further depend on lenders\u2019 discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks and to recharacterize assets that might otherwise incrementally decrease borrowing availability.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our annual cash flow for the next several years to the payment of interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as, over the term of our debt, the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nIn addition, the indentures and credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the indentures and the credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nIn addition, if new debt is added or we buy back stock or pay dividends, the risks we face as a result of our leverage would increase.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur operations are conducted through our global subsidiaries and our ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness will depend on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries may have limitations or restrictions on paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities or transfer sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may need to recognize additional impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets. We are required to test goodwill for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nIf, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. Any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant variability in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile and a significant level of foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. and other carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, the level of repatriation of earnings from foreign affiliates, changes in tax laws, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties and the inability to realize foreign tax credits and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets, among other matters, may significantly impact our effective income tax rate in the future. A significant increase in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThere are proposals to change tax laws in many of the countries in which we do business. In particular, current U.S. tax reform proposals could significantly impact how we are taxed on both domestic operations as well as on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Although we cannot predict whether, when or in what form proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, certain proposed tax law changes could have a material adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flow.\nWe are commonly audited by various tax authorities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nLabor Related Risks\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees.\nOur business depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees, including our sales force, operations management and skilled production workers, at our operations around the world. Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the industries in which we operate is intense. Our growth by acquisitions creates challenges in retaining employees. As the corporate culture evolves to incorporate new workforces, some employees may not find the new culture appealing. In addition, the pace of integration may cause retention issues with our workforce due to integration fatigue. Difficulties in obtaining or retaining employees with the necessary management, technical and financial skills needed to achieve our business objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. We depend on our senior management team and other key employees for strategic success. Some of our key employees are nearing retirement age. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nAs our workforce ages, we are challenged to find and attract a younger population to replace them. Younger generations are driven by progression and opportunity which may be limited by our current employee population. Our growth potential may be limited if we fail to attract and retain competent employees or we are unable to sustain necessary employment levels long-term.\nLabor unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile none of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, a significant part of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers\u2019 councils or similar statutory arrangements. In addition, many of our direct and indirect customers and vendors have unionized workforces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or vendors, contract manufacturers or other suppliers could have a negative impact on us. Organizations responsible for shipping our products may also be impacted by labor disruptions. Any interruption in the delivery of our products could harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products or increase costs and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have obligations under our defined benefit employee benefit plans and may be required to make plan contributions in excess of current estimates.\nAt December 31, 2016, our net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits was $30.2 million (benefit obligations of $382.7 million and plan assets of $352.5 million). See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant declines in the assets and/or increases in the liabilities related to these obligations as a result of changes in actuarial estimates, asset performance, interest rates or benefit changes, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.\nThe amounts and timing of the contributions we expect to make to our defined benefit plans reflect a number of actuarial and other estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected plan funding obligations. The actual amounts and timing of these contributions will depend upon a number of factors and the actual amounts and timing of our future plan funding contributions may differ materially from those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we elect to terminate one or more of these plans and settle the obligation through the purchase of annuities, we could incur a charge and/or be required to make additional contributions and such amounts could be material.\nOur financial condition may be adversely affected to the extent that we are required to make contributions to any of our defined benefit plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections.\nInternational Risks\nOur significant international operations expose us to economic, political and other risks.\nWe have significant international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations. We have major international manufacturing and/or distribution facilities in, among other countries, Australia, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Singapore and the United Kingdom (U.K.). For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, international sales represented approximately 46%, 51% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In general, our international sales have lower gross margin percentages than our domestic sales. To the extent international sales represent a greater percentage of our revenue, our overall gross margin percentages may decline.\nOur international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to the risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic and political destabilization; restrictive actions by foreign governments; wage inflation; nationalizations; the laws and policies of the U.S affecting trade, anti-bribery, foreign investment and loans; foreign tax laws, including the ability to recover amounts paid as value-added and similar taxes; potential restrictions on the repatriation of cash; reduced protection of intellectual property; longer customer payment cycles; compliance with local laws and regulations; armed conflict; terrorism; shipping interruptions; and major health concerns (such as infectious diseases). A significant portion of our products sold in the U.S. are manufactured outside the U.S. We utilize lower-cost geographies for high labor content products while investing in largely automated plants in higher-cost regions close to customers. Most of our manufacturing employees are located in lower-cost geographies such as Mexico, China, India and the Czech Republic. To the extent there are changes in U.S. trade policies, such as significant increases in tariffs or duties for goods brought into the U.S., our competitive position may be adversely impacted and the resulting effect on our earnings could be material.\nRisks related to fluctuations in foreign currency rates can impact our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency risk exposure is mainly concentrated in Chinese yuan, euro, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, British pound and Mexican peso. We manage our foreign currency rate risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective or that the counterparties to our derivative contracts will be able to perform. In addition, foreign currency rates in many of the countries in which we operate have at times been extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may choose not to hedge or determine we are unable to effectively hedge the risks associated with this volatility. In such cases, we may experience declines in sales and adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nOur international operations expose us to increased challenges in complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions.\nWe are required to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, we are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from improperly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. We frequently rely on distributors, sales agents and other channel partners in connection with our sales to these state-owned enterprises, and could be held responsible for the improper actions of these third parties if we were to benefit from their actions, even though we may have limited control over them. We are also subject to the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of our activities in these locations, we are exposed to an increased risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, our employees, subcontractors or channel partners could take actions that violate these requirements, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargos. If we were to fail to comply with applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe may incur costs and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others.\nWe may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, we have been required, and may be required in the future, to initiate litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the products or intellectual property that we have acquired through acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain markets, we may be required to address counterfeit versions of our products. We may incur significant costs in pursuing the originators of such counterfeit products and, if we are unsuccessful in eliminating them from the market, we may experience a reduction in the value of our products and/or a reduction in our net sales.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are or may be subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union has issued Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU (WEEE) regulating the manufacture, use and disposal of electrical goods and chemicals. If we do not comply with these and similar laws in other jurisdictions or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased cost of compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEfforts to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, are underway in the U.S. and other countries which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict and in some circumstances joint and several liability on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. This can have the effect that an entity pays more than its fair share to address such contamination. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and occasionally disposed of at such facilities. Consequently, from time to time it has been necessary to undertake investigation and remediation projects at a few of these sites. There can be no assurance that the contractual indemnifications we have received from prior owners and operators of certain of these facilities will continue to be honored. In addition, we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites, and from time to time we have been and may be held responsible for investigation and clean-up costs at these sites, particularly where those owners and operators have been unable to address such investigation and clean-up costs. Also, there can be no guarantee that new environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement or the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which could be material.\nStockholder Equity Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to reduce indebtedness and fund our growth; in addition, we may from time to time make share repurchases. Therefore, the success of an investment of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value, and there can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value. The payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In addition, the indentures and the credit agreements governing our indebtedness also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not otherwise be able to pay dividends on our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, could be issued by the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance, without stockholder approval, of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ngrant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and require any such removal to be approved by holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; establish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with three staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those our stockholders desire.", "PERMNO": 14239, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "COMM"}
