Risk Factors.\nThe occurrence of any of the events described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Restatement\nThe Restatement has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as growth plans and investor confidence in our company.\nAs described in the section entitled \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d preceding Part I and in \u201cNote 3 - Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the quarters and year-to-date periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2018; March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2017; and March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2016, and selected financial data (\u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, derived from unaudited financial statements. The Restatement process has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as our growth plans (including delays or alterations to certain de novo projects as described herein) and investor confidence in our company.\nWe have incurred substantial unanticipated costs of approximately $0.4 million in 2018 and approximately $16 million through June 30, 2019 in audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees in connection with the Restatement, the SEC Investigation, private litigation, the amendment of our credit agreement and our third-party clinic-level debt resulting from the Restatement and remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps that we have deemed appropriate and reasonable to strengthen our accounting function and reduce the risk of future restatements, as described in more detail in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d To the extent these steps and any additional remediation steps we take are not successful, we may need to incur additional time and expense to address accounting issues that could arise in the future. We cannot predict when we will complete our efforts to fully remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or the total costs we will incur in these efforts. Our management\u2019s attention has been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of our business and our growth plans, including opening or acquiring new clinics, as a result of the time and attention required to address the Restatement, the ongoing remediation of material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the SEC Investigation, private litigation and related matters. We may find it necessary to hire additional members of management to achieve our remediation and business goals following the Restatement.\nWe are also subject to claims and investigations arising out of the adjustments made to our previously issued financial statements. For information regarding this litigation, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, negatively impacting investor confidence.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act and is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on a periodic basis and publicly disclose the results of these evaluations and related matters in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Management has identified material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2018, including material weaknesses relating to the ineffectiveness, or failure to maintain effective controls relating to: (1) the control environment, (2) accounting for net patient service operating revenues, net accounts receivable, amounts due to payors, income taxes, noncontrolling interests and review and approval of journal entries, (3) information and communication and (4) monitoring. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d for a discussion of these material weaknesses. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have taken and will continue to take actions that we believe will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified. However, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We cannot predict when this determination will be made, or that the actions taken will be effective to remediate the identified material weaknesses. We will also continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify our remediation plan, which may require additional implementation time. We cannot predict when any additional remediation measures will be fully developed, the timing and effectiveness of our implementation of these remediation measures or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation measures are determined to be operating effectively, our management may be required to continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation measures are inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain misstatements that will be undetected. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, then we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our credit agreement or agreements governing our third-party clinic-level debt, and we may be required to seek additional amendments or waivers under these agreements, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could reduce our ability to access the capital markets or obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any new misstatement could result in a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet timely our periodic reporting obligations with the SEC, cause us to violate debt covenants, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in the value of our common stock. We may discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Restatement has resulted in securities class action and derivative litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nFollowing our March 27, 2019 announcement of the Restatement, we and certain of our current and former executive officers were named as defendants in two putative class action lawsuits, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b5-1 thereunder. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single class action lawsuit, captioned Ali Vandevar, et. al. v. American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc., et. al., No. 19-9074-ES-MAH, which remains pending. The\nconsolidated action alleges, among other things, that our financial statements for the Restated Periods were materially false and misleading.\nIn addition, on July 25, 2019, a derivative lawsuit, Luke Johnson v. Joseph A. Carlucci, et al., 2:19-CV-15812-JMV-JBC was filed, purportedly on our behalf, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the members of our board of directors and certain of our current and former executive officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets based on, among other things, the Restatement and the related material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, alleged misstatements and omissions in our 2017 and 2018 proxy statements, compensation paid to the individual defendants and the costs incurred in connection with the Restatement process.\nWe and our current and former executive officers and directors could become subject to further private litigation arising out of the adjustments to our previously issued financial statements. Our management has been, and will continue to be, required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these actions and any additional litigation that arises could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and cash flows. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant legal and other expenses investigating the claims underlying this litigation and expect to continue to need to incur significant legal and other expenses relating to these matters.\nWe are subject to the ongoing SEC Investigation, which has and will continue to require significant legal and other expense and management time and attention, and could result in a government enforcement action that could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nAs disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2019, the Staff of the SEC is currently investigating certain revenue recognition, collections and related matters relating to us. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses related to audit, legal, consulting and other professional services in connection with the Audit Committee\u2019s review, the SEC Investigation and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses, the delay in timely filing this Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, and the diversion of the attention of our management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nFurthermore, if the SEC commences legal action as a result of the SEC Investigation, we and certain of our current and former executive officers could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, cease and desist orders and other equitable remedies. The SEC Investigation will not be resolved as a result of the completion of the Audit Committee\u2019s review of our financial statements for the Restated Periods and the filing of this Form 10-K. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of the SEC Investigation or any other related governmental or regulatory investigation.\nOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could result in significant legal expenses or damages and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nCertain of our current and former executive officers are the subject of the above-referenced lawsuits as individual defendants, and they, along with other executive officers and our directors, could become subject to further private litigation or one or more government investigations or enforcement actions arising out of the adjustments to our previously issued financial statements. Under Delaware law and our amended and restated bylaws, we have indemnification obligations to our current and former executive officers and directors in relation to these matters or potential matters, as the case may be. These indemnification obligations have resulted and may continue to result in significant legal expenses to us, and may result in fines, settlement costs or other expenses for which we may be required to provide indemnification.\nWhile we maintain director and officer liability insurance, we may be required to incur significant indemnification expenses to the extent our insurance carriers take the position that some or all of the costs and expenses associated with the private litigation and/or the SEC Investigation, including the costs of resolution of these matters, are not subject to insurance coverage or, if covered, such amounts exceed the maximum amount of available insurance.\nThe Restatement, SEC Investigation, class action and derivative lawsuits and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our business relationships.\nOur operations and business rely on our reputation and relationships with our patients, the nephrologist community, including our nephrologist partners, medical directors, vendors, creditors, referral sources and other constituents important to our business. The Restatement, SEC Investigation, class action and derivative lawsuits and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our reputation and these relationships, including certain contractual arrangements\nwith these persons. For example, the Restatement has impacted certain of our clinic-level financial statements for the Restated Periods, which could affect past calculations under certain of our physician agreements. This impact could impair our relationships with the affected nephrologist partners or result in disputes with them, contractual or otherwise. Nephrologists, for whom we already face intense competition, may be less willing to become or continue to serve as nephrologist partners or as medical directors. An inability to attract suitable nephrologist partners on terms acceptable to us could delay or impair our de novo clinic growth. If we are not able to attract new medical directors or maintain existing medical director relationships, our ability to provide medical services at our facilities would be impaired, resulting in reduced revenues. In addition, the Restatement and existence of the SEC Investigation and lawsuits could generate negative publicity and lead to a lack of confidence in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation with referral sources and our patients themselves. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDelayed filing of some of our periodic SEC reports has made us currently ineligible to use certain registration statements to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions or to issue equity awards.\nBecause we were unable to file this Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 with the SEC on a timely basis, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for one year. It is possible that, in the event of an enforcement action by the SEC, the final terms of any settlement with the SEC may further prolong our inability to register securities on Form S-3. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, we would be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer than filing a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nFurthermore, we have several employee and director equity incentive plans that are registered on Form S-8, including our 2016 Omnibus Plan. Under SEC regulations, our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC resulted in the suspension of the availability of our Form S-8 for issuances of shares underlying equity awards subject to these plans. For that reason, employees have not been permitted to exercise any outstanding options for unrestricted shares of our common stock and we have been unable to grant other equity awards under our Form S-8. Until such time that we are deemed to have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act, we will not be able to grant equity incentive awards to our employees, and our employees will not be able to exercise their stock options, in either case for unrestricted shares under Form S-8.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on commercial payors for reimbursement at rates that allow us to operate at a profit.\nCommercial payors pay us at rates that are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates and the rates paid by other government-based payors such as state Medicaid programs. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 28%, 35% and 43%, respectively, of net patient service operating revenues from commercial payors, including non-contracted providers, even though commercial payors were the source of reimbursement for approximately 12%, 13% and 17% of the treatments performed during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflecting a decrease over the period in the proportion of commercial payors relative to government payors as a source of reimbursement. Medicare rates are generally insufficient to cover our total operating expenses allocable to providing dialysis treatments for Medicare patients. As a result, our ability to generate operating earnings is substantially dependent on revenues derived from commercial payors, some of which pay negotiated payment rates and others of which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule, typically at a discount. To the extent the proportion of commercial payors continues to decrease relative to government payors as a source of reimbursement for treatments, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nIf the number of patients with commercial insurance declines, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are sensitive to the number of patients with commercial insurance coverage, including those with employer group health plans, as well as the number of patients who have chosen ACA-compliant individual marketplace plans (\u201cACA plans\u201d) and other non-employer-based plans. A patient\u2019s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the patient\u2019s or a family member\u2019s employment status. Other factors that may cause an increase in the number of patients who have government-based programs as their primary payors include changes to terms or\nthe availability of coverage from commercial payors, changes to the healthcare regulatory system, sustained or increased job losses and improved longevity and lower standard mortality rates for ESRD patients, resulting in a lower percentage of patients covered under commercial insurance plans. The percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans could also be negatively impacted by a continued decline in the rate of growth of the ESRD patient population. In addition, our continued negotiations with existing and new commercial payors could result in a further decrease in the number of patients under commercial insurance plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with these payors on rates and other terms.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced an adverse change in the commercial treatment mix as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the introduction of more restrictive benefit plan designs by certain commercial payors, including plans with disincentives for patients to select or remain with out-of-network providers. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the percentage of treatments accounted for by commercial payors and others, including ACA plans, but not including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the \u201cVA\u201d) was 9%, compared to 11% for the prior year, and we expect it to remain lower. If there is a significant additional reduction in the number of ESRD patients insured through commercial insurance plans, whether ACA plans or non-ACA commercial insurance plans, relative to patients insured through government-based programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nIf there is a decline in financial assistance from charitable organizations to patients with commercial insurance, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nSome patients with commercial insurance coverage receive financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund (\u201cAKF\u201d). Certain commercial payors have challenged the availability and legitimacy of charitable support as a premium funding source for patients, including through litigation, and other strategies. A number of commercial payors have incorporated policies into their provider manuals limiting or refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from charitable organizations. Furthermore, we have received letters from certain insurance companies indicating that they will not insure patients who receive premium payment assistance from third-party charitable organizations. There have also been regulatory and legislative efforts considering the imposition of restrictions and obligations relating to the use, by patients on commercial plans, of charitable premium support. Regulators such as CMS have considered (and, in some instances, questioned) the use of charitable premium assistance for ESRD patients purchasing ACA plans. In January 2019, a California bill (AB 290) was introduced in the California legislature, similar to a bill (SB 1156) that was passed in 2018 by the legislature but vetoed by the prior governor, that would impose restrictions and obligations related to the use, by patients on commercial plans, of charitable premium assistance in the State of California and would limit the amounts paid to a provider for services provided to those patients if that provider has a financial relationship with the organization providing charitable premium assistance. See \u201c-If the rates paid by commercial payors continue to decline, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected\u201d below. If any of these challenges to kidney patients\u2019 use of premium support are successful or restrictions are imposed on the use of financial assistance from such charitable organizations such that patients are unable to obtain or continue to receive, or receive only for a limited duration, such financial assistance, our revenues, earnings and cash flow could be substantially reduced. Further, any law, rule or other regulatory action by CMS or other federal or state regulatory or legislative authorities that limits the payments that a dialysis provider can retain for treatments provided to commercial patients, affects payments made to providers for services provided to patients who receive charitable premium assistance and/or otherwise restricts or prohibits the use of charitable premium assistance could materially reduce our revenues.\nIn addition, AKF has in the past, and may in the future, suspend premium assistance payments from time to time and may experience decreases from time to time in the donations it receives. Any funding shortfall at a charity such as AKF or any other inability of such charity to make premium support payments could adversely affect patients\u2019 ability to afford commercial insurance coverage, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIf the rates paid by commercial payors continue to decline, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nThe dialysis services industry is subject to rate pressure from commercial payors, including employer group health plans, as well as ACA plans, as a result of general conditions in the market, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors and other factors. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, which has led to an increase in the number of in-network contracted payors that reimburse us at rates that are generally lower than out-of network payors. Commercial payors generally seek to limit their costs through plans with disincentives for patients to select or remain with out-of-network providers, downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates (whether under ACA plans or otherwise), imposing reductions in payment rates if certain clinical measures are not met, efforts to design and implement plans that limit access to coverage, reductions in the duration and/or the breadth of benefits or even litigation may result in decreased payments and/or disruption to our business. In the event that our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases and such changes are not offset by increases in the number of covered patients receiving our services, the net impact would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash\nflows. In addition, consolidations in the healthcare sector, including mergers of healthcare insurers and acquisitions of healthcare providers by insurers, may significantly increase the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. Our negotiations with payors are influenced by competitive and other pressures exerted by such payors, which may result in decreases to some of our contracted rates or a termination of certain of our relationships with commercial payors.\nIn addition to downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates, commercial payors have in some instances decreased, and may continue to decrease, payment rates for non-contracted providers. Commercial payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on patient access to ACA plans and non-contracted or out-of-network providers. Some of our clinics are currently designated as out-of-network providers by some of our current commercial payors. Commercial payors have restructured, and may continue to restructure, their benefits to create impediments for patients in selecting particular providers, including disincentives for patients to select or remain with out-of-network providers. We have in the past, and may again in the future, determine that it is appropriate to enter into long-term contracts with commercial payors with respect to which we are an out-of-network provider, even if the reimbursement rates under the contracts are materially less favorable to us than the rates we currently receive. Reductions in contracted commercial payor rates or rates received with respect to non-contracted providers, or these or any other measures applied by commercial payors to limit their costs may make certain dialysis centers economically unviable and could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenues derived from commercial payors and a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nIf we do not continuously obtain new patients covered by commercial insurance, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are sensitive to the number of new dialysis patients covered by commercial insurance. Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD generally become eligible for coverage on the first day of the third month after the month in which a course of regular dialysis begins, but this three-month waiting period may be partially or completely waived if the patient participates in a self-dialysis training program or has a kidney transplant. For a dialysis patient with commercial insurance coverage, the commercial insurance plan generally is the primary payor for a period of up to 33 months beginning on the first month that the individual would be entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, regardless of whether the patient actually enrolls in Medicare. After that, Medicare becomes the primary payor as long as the individual retains eligibility based on ESRD and the part B premiums are timely paid. Medicare coverage ends if the patient has not received dialysis for 12 months, if 36 months have passed since the beneficiary had a successful kidney transplant or if the patient disenrolls from Medicare part B.\nWhen Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient shifts from the commercial insurance rate to the Medicare payment rate, which is generally significantly lower than the commercial rate. For each covered treatment, Medicare pays 80% of the amount set by the Medicare program and the patient is responsible for the remaining 20%. In many cases, a secondary payor, such as Medicare supplemental insurance (offered by commercial payors), another commercial insurance plan or Medicaid, covers all or part of these balances. If dialysis patients who have Medicare as their primary payor do not have secondary insurance coverage, we must attempt to collect payment from the patient using reasonable collection efforts consistent with federal and state law, unless we are permitted by law to waive this 20% copayment. In those cases where we seek the copayment, we may not be successful in collecting it. A portion of the Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectible from the patient may be reimbursed by CMS under certain circumstances, but the percentage of these bad debts for which we receive reimbursement has been reduced in recent years and is subject to further reduction by CMS. If there is a significant reduction in the number of new dialysis patients covered by commercial insurance, we would not receive the benefit of the period of up to 33 months of higher reimbursement rates from commercial payors, which would materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe bundled payment system under the Medicare ESRD program may not reimburse us for all of our operating costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 72%, of our revenues from reimbursement from government-based and other programs, including 51% from the Medicare ESRD program and 16% from Medicare-assigned insurance through the Medicare Advantage program. The reimbursement that we receive from Medicare under the ESRD prospective payment rate system (the \u201cESRD PPS\u201d), described under \u201cItem 1. Business-Reimbursement-Medicare Reimbursement-ESRD Prospective Payment Rate System\u201d may be insufficient to cover our treatment costs.\nFor patients with Medicare coverage, all reimbursement of dialysis services is made using a bundled payment system. The bundled payment under the ESRD PPS covers both the dialysis treatment and the majority of the renal-related items and services provided to a patient during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services, pharmaceuticals, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (\u201cESAs\u201d), and medication administration, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed, with the exception of drugs that are reimbursed under the Medicare ESRD PPS\nTDAPA program. The TDAPA program was established by CMS to facilitate beneficiary access to certain qualifying products by allowing payment for these drugs and biologicals during a transitional time period while the necessary utilization data is collected. The TDAPA program provides a drug designation process for determining when a product is no longer an oral-only drug and for determining when new injectables and intravenous products will be included in the ESRD bundled payment.\nWhile CMS issues annual updates to the ESRD PPS, which may affect the related base rate as well as the various adjusters, our operating costs may outpace these and any future rate increases we receive under the ESRD PPS, and we may not be able to adjust our operations adequately to manage such costs. If drug or medical supply prices, for instance, increase beyond that contemplated when the bundled rate was set by CMS, the difference between the bundled rate and the drug or supply-related costs could have a significant adverse effect on a facility\u2019s profitability. Further, the bundled payment system requires dialysis facilities to provide new services within the payment bundle, unless designated under the Medicare ESRD PPS\nTDAPA program, which may increase our operating costs. We may not recoup these costs, even with rate adjustments. If products we are required to provide are transitioned from the separate reimbursement under the TDAPA program to inclusion in the ESRD PPS bundled rate, we may not receive adequate reimbursement under the ESRD PPS, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, the case-mix adjustment component of the ESRD PPS renders it difficult for us to predict the Medicare-related revenues that we will receive, due to the number and variety of patient-level adjustment factors. We may not be able to make necessary adjustments in our operations to accommodate reductions in revenue that may result from case-mix variations.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to develop de novo clinics. Our attempt to expand through development of de novo clinics entails risks to our growth, as well as to our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have experienced significant clinic growth since our inception. We have grown primarily through the development of de novo dialysis clinics as JVs with new and existing partner nephrologists or nephrologist groups. Growth through development places significant demands on our financial and management resources. The time and expense devoted to the Restatement process has caused us to re-evaluate the timing of our investments in certain de novo projects and could cause certain of these projects to be delayed or otherwise altered. Inability on our part to address these demands or resume the projects impacted by the re-evaluation of the timing of our investments could adversely affect our growth, our operating results and financial condition.\nWe generally expand by seeking appropriate locations for a dialysis clinic, taking into consideration the availability of a nephrologist to be our medical director and nephrologist partner, payor types and a skilled work force, including qualified nursing and technical personnel. The inability to identify suitable locations, suitable nephrologist partners and workforce personnel for our dialysis clinics could adversely affect our growth, as well as our operating results and financial condition.\nThe development of a de novo dialysis clinic can be expensive and may include costs related to construction, equipment and initial working capital. De novo dialysis clinics are subject to various risks, including risks associated with the availability, timing and terms of financing for development, construction delays, securing appropriate licenses and permits, achieving brand awareness in new markets, managing increases in costs, competing for appropriate sites in new markets and maintaining adequate information systems and other operational system capabilities. Our ability to develop additional clinics may be limited by state certificate of need programs and other regulatory restrictions on expansion. States without certificate of need programs may begin restricting the development of new clinics and states with existing programs may institute more restrictive measures.\nOur de novo clinics may not become cash flow positive or profitable on a timely basis or at all. Delays in the opening of de novo clinics, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital constraints, difficulties resulting from commercial, residential and infrastructure development (or lack thereof) near our de novo clinics, difficulties in staffing and operating new locations or lack of acceptance in new market areas may negatively impact our de novo clinic growth and the costs or the profitability associated with de novo clinics. Further, additional federal or state legislative or regulatory restrictions or licensure requirements could negatively impact our ability to operate both existing and de novo clinics.\nThe inability to develop de novo clinics with new or existing partner nephrologists or nephrologist groups on reasonable terms or in a cost-effective manner would adversely affect our growth as well as our operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to continue to successfully expand our business through establishing de novo clinics, and any new de novo clinics may not achieve profitability that is consistent with our past results or otherwise perform as planned. Failure to successfully implement any of our growth strategies, including developing de novo clinics, would likely have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to attract new nephrologist partners on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to do so, our future growth could be limited.\nWe believe that an important component of our financial performance and growth is our partnership with physicians that purchase ownership interests in our joint venture clinics. Our ability to partner with physicians may be inhibited in markets where a large portion of nephrologists are subject to covenants not to compete with our competitors. Based on competitive factors and market conditions, physicians may seek to negotiate relatively higher levels of equity ownership in our clinics, consequently limiting or reducing our share of the profits from these clinics. Negative publicity related to the Restatement, SEC Investigation and related matters may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain nephrologist partners, as described in more detail in \u201c-The Restatement, SEC Investigation, class action and derivative lawsuits and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our business relationships.\u201d In addition, physician ownership in our clinics is subject to significant regulatory restrictions. See \u201c-Our arrangements and relationships with our nephrologist partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti-kickback statute and certain state anti-kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.\u201d\nDe novo clinics, once opened, may not be profitable initially or at all, and the comparable de novo revenue that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results.\nOur results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by a number of factors, including factors outside of our control related to the opening of de novo clinics, such as the timing of de novo clinic openings, associated de novo clinic preopening costs and operating inefficiencies. We typically incur the most significant portion of operating losses associated with a given de novo clinic within a relatively short amount of time preceding and following the opening of the de novo clinic. A de novo clinic builds its patient volumes over time and, as a result, generally has lower revenue than our existing clinics. Newly established dialysis clinics, although contributing to increased revenues, have adversely affected our results of operations in the short term due to a smaller patient base to absorb operating expenses. Any de novo clinics we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing de novo clinics. If our de novo clinics do not perform similar to de novo clinics we have opened in the past, then our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve expected comparable de novo clinic revenues, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire existing dialysis clinics. If we are unable to successfully complete such acquisitions, our future growth could be limited.\nOur business strategy includes the selective acquisition of existing dialysis clinics. In general, acquiring an existing dialysis clinic is more costly than developing a de novo dialysis clinic but has historically been a faster means for achieving profitability and entering a new market. If we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy in the future, our future growth could be limited. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to complete acquisitions in a timely manner and on favorable terms. The time and expense of the Restatement process may also cause us to delay or decide not to pursue acquisitions that would have been beneficial to our growth. We may need to obtain additional capital or financing, from time to time, to fund these acquisitions. Sufficient capital or financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, our ability to acquire additional clinics may be limited by state certificate of need programs and other regulatory restrictions on expansion. Even if we are able to acquire additional clinics, there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate them successfully as stand-alone businesses, or that any such acquired clinic will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the acquired clinic will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage any acquired clinic. We also face significant competition from local, regional and national dialysis operators and other owners of clinics in pursuing attractive acquisition candidates. See \u201c-Our competitors have increasingly adopted a JV model and compete with us for establishing de novo clinics, acquiring existing dialysis clinics and engaging medical directors, which could materially adversely impact our growth prospects.\u201d The inability to acquire existing clinics on reasonable terms or in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our growth as well as our operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions may subject us to unknown liabilities, and we may not be indemnified for all of these liabilities.\nBusinesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we may not be successful in obtaining indemnification. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may be subject to liabilities greater than the contractual limits of our indemnification or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any\namounts recovered through rights to indemnification, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation or our brand in existing or new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built our reputation on the high quality of our dialysis clinic services, physicians and operating personnel, as well as on our culture and the experience of our patients in our clinics, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to continue to be successful in the future. Our brand may be diminished if we do not continue to make the day-to-day investments required for clinic operations, equipment upgrades and staff training. Any incident, real or perceived, regardless of merit or outcome, that erodes our brand, such as adverse patient outcomes due to medical malpractice or allegations of medical malpractice, failure to comply with federal, state or local regulations including allegations or perceptions of non-compliance, failure to comply with ethical and operating standards, or the Restatement and related matters, could significantly reduce the value of our brand, expose us to adverse publicity and damage our overall business and reputation. Further, our brand value could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if patients perceive a reduction in the quality of service or staff, or an adverse change in our culture or otherwise believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive patient experience.\nInfringement of our trademarks and other proprietary rights or a finding that our services infringe the proprietary rights of others could impair our competitive position, require us to change our business practices or subject us to significant costs and monetary penalties.\nOur ability to successfully grow our business depends in part on our ability to maintain brand recognition using our trademarks and logos. If our efforts to protect our trademarks are unsuccessful and third parties are able to use the same or similar brand names in competitive business lines, the value of our business may be harmed. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be liable for damages or be subject to an injunction that forces us to rebrand our services or replace certain technology or other intellectual property. If we are unable to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, or if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, such events could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal laws negatively impacting Medicare reimbursement to our dialysis facilities may have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nSubsequent to the establishment of the ESRD PPS, Congress has from time to time enacted legislation that has resulted in reductions to Medicare program reimbursement rates for dialysis services or affected the bundle of items and services for which we are reimbursed. For example, legislation passed in 2012 and 2014 previously reduced the market basket inflation adjustment to the ESRD PPS bundled rate for payment years 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, the inclusion of oral-only ESRD-related drugs in the bundled payment, originally scheduled to occur in 2016, has twice been delayed to the current implementation date of January 1, 2025. The uncertainty about future payment rates is a material risk to our business, and any future reductions to reimbursement rates or changes in the items and services included within the ESRD PPS bundled payment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal budget sequestration cuts, including a 2% reduction to Medicare payments, became effective in 2013 and have been extended through 2027. These cuts have affected and will continue to affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows. In 2018, the U.S. President and Congress each proposed additional spending cuts and tax reform initiatives, some of which would have resulted in changes (including significant reductions in funding) to Medicare and Medicaid. These measures and any similar measures proposed by the U.S. President or Congress, if adopted, could affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Future federal legislation relating to the federal government\u2019s borrowing authority or deficit reduction may also have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nThe Advancing American Kidney Health initiative may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and revenues.\nOn July 10, 2019, the U.S. President signed an executive order to launch the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative. As directed by the executive order, CMS released a proposed required payment model and four optional payment models. The four optional payment models are expected to enroll more than 200,000 Medicare patients in new arrangements with dialysis providers, and the required payment model, known as ESRD Treatment Choices, will encourage dialysis in the home. These changes in financial incentives for dialysis providers and the expansion of government programs could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater\nrisk of uncollectible receivables. Under the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative, our dialysis facilities may be subject to downward payment adjustments that could adversely affect our patient service operating revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ESRD Quality Incentive Program may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and revenues.\nThe ESRD Quality Incentive Program (\u201cQIP\u201d), which is administered by CMS, is designed to promote the provision of high-quality dialysis services in outpatient dialysis facilities. Under the ESRD QIP, a portion of the bundled per treatment payment that a dialysis facility receives from Medicare is tied to the facility\u2019s performance in a previous year on certain quality of care measures. These measures are based on specifications from CMS, as these may be updated from time to time. If a dialysis facility does not meet or exceed certain performance standards related to these measures during a performance year, the facility will be subject to a reduction in Medicare payments of up to 2% for all services performed during a subsequent payment year. CMS modifies the ESRD QIP each year, such that the quality measures selected, the performance scoring system and other factors that impact a dialysis facility\u2019s ESRD QIP performance will likely differ from year to year. CMS has established the ESRD QIP performance measures for payment years through 2022, but these measures may be subject to further change by CMS. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Reimbursement-Medicare Reimbursement\u201d for a discussion of the currently established performance measures. Any changes to the ESRD QIP measures could have an adverse impact on our ability to avoid or minimize Medicare payment reductions under the ESRD QIP. Under the ESRD QIP, our dialysis facilities may be subject to downward Medicare program payment adjustments that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and revenues.\nDisruptions in federal government operations and funding create uncertainty in our industry and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any federal government shutdown and/or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments.\nThe federal government publishes performance and quality data on dialysis facilities, which includes a star rating system. If our facilities receive low ratings or if the ratings and data published by CMS are inaccurate, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected by a loss of patients or lack of new patients.\nCMS includes a star rating system on the Dialysis Facility Compare (\u201cDFC\u201d) website, a portal that publishes qualitative and quantitative information regarding clinical outcomes and the efficacy of dialysis at Medicare certified dialysis facilities. The star rating system ranks facilities on a scale of 1 to 5 stars based on DFC quality measures and utilizes a normal distribution. Due to differences in patient populations and DFC quality measures, star ratings can vary significantly between dialysis facilities without reflecting actual differences in treatment quality. Although CMS has established the ESRD Star Rating Technical Experts Panel to review the methodology for producing the star ratings, there is no guarantee that star ratings will accurately reflect the quality of care provided at a dialysis facility. If our facilities receive low star ratings or if data published on the DFC website is inaccurate, it could adversely affect our ability to retain or attract new patients, and, accordingly, adversely affect our revenues.\nChanges in VA, state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government programs or payment rates could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 2% of our revenues and 2.5% of our treatment volume from patients primarily insured through the VA. In December 2010, the VA adopted Medicare\u2019s bundled payment system, resulting in a reduction in payments for dialysis services at centers treating VA patients. To the extent payments are further reduced or to the extent we lose VA patients as a result of VA policies, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 4% of our revenues and 6% of our treatment volume from patients who had Medicaid or Medicaid managed care as their primary insurer. As state governments face increasing budgetary pressure, they may propose reductions in payment rates, delays in the timing of payments, limitations on eligibility or other changes to Medicaid programs. Some states have already taken steps to reduce or delay payments. In addition, some states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility requirements mandate that enrollees in Medicaid programs provide documented\nproof of citizenship. More recently, several states have begun adopting work or similar requirements for many enrollees in Medicaid. Our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected to the extent that we are not paid by Medicaid or other state programs for services provided to patients who are unable to satisfy the eligibility requirements. If state governments reduce the rates paid by Medicaid programs for dialysis and related services, delay the timing of payment for services provided, further limit eligibility for Medicaid coverage or adopt changes to the Medicaid payment structure that reduce our overall payments from Medicaid, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nChanges in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations relating to ESAs and other pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to care for patients.\nThe Medicare bundled payment system includes reimbursement for ESAs such that ESA dosing variations do not change the amount paid to a dialysis facility. Many commercial insurance programs have been moving towards a bundled payment system inclusive of ESAs, while some continue to pay for ESAs separately. Increased utilization of ESAs for patients for whom the cost of ESAs is included in a bundled reimbursement rate or changes to administration policies could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Any cost savings that we may realize from reductions in the frequency with which ESAs are administered by our facilities may be offset or eliminated by reductions in the national base rate set by Medicare, which could have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nIn addition, changes in reimbursement rates for ESAs and other pharmaceuticals that are reimbursed outside of the bundled rate could similarly affect our operating results. For example, under the TDAPA program, the oral and IV forms of calcimimetics are separately reimbursed by Medicare and not included within the Medicare bundled payment rate system. During the applicable transitional period, we expect that the wider availability of generic supplies of oral calcimimetics will drive the acquisition cost of that drug down, which could in turn lower associated reimbursement rates. We cannot predict the timing and specifics of how CMS will permanently incorporate oral and IV calcimimetics into the Medicare bundled payment rate system after the TDAPA program period. Changes in these reimbursement rates could lead to significant fluctuations in our operating income and could have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by third parties related to our medication administration and billing policies for ESAs and other pharmaceuticals. Inquiries or audits from governmental bodies or claims by third parties would require management\u2019s attention and could result in significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or repayment obligations, mandates to change our practices and procedures as well as the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, and exclusion from future participation in federal healthcare programs.\nChanges in the availability and cost of ESAs and other pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to care for patients.\nThe ESAs required for our clinics are supplied by Amgen Inc. (\u201cAmgen\u201d), with its drugs branded as EPOGEN (\u201cEPO\u201d) and Aranesp and by Vifor International AG (\u201cVifor\u201d), with the F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. drug branded as Mircera and the Pfizer drug branded as Retacrit. Under our agreement with Amgen, Amgen may unilaterally decide to increase its prices for EPO and Aranesp at any time. In the event that it does so, Vifor may be unable to increase its supply of Mircera or Retacrit to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to avoid incurring such increased prices, and we may not have access to alternative ESAs that are both cost-effective and work as effectively as our current ESAs. We do not have the ability to pass on any price increases to Medicare and Medicaid and may not have the ability to pass on price increases to commercial payors. Changes in the availability and cost of ESAs and other renal-related pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows and ultimately reduce our income.\nIf our suppliers are unable to meet our needs, if there are material price increases or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe available supply of ESAs from Amgen and Vifor could be delayed or reduced, whether by one or both of them, through unforeseen circumstances or as a result of excessive demand. If Amgen or Vifor is unable to meet our needs for ESAs, including in the event of a product recall, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, Amgen may terminate for convenience with 30 days\u2019 notice the group purchasing organization agreement through which we are supplied ESAs by them. If Amgen terminates the agreement for convenience, Vifor may be unable to timely increase, or increase at all, its supply of ESAs to cover any resulting shortfall, and we may not have access to alternative ESAs that are both cost-effective and work as effectively as our current ESAs.\nIn addition, the technology related to ESAs is subject to new developments that may result in superior products. If we are not able to access these superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for products, we could face patient attrition, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe monitor our relationships with suppliers to better anticipate any potential shortages and reduce the likelihood of the loss of a supplier. However, if we experience shortages or material price increases that we are unable to mitigate, this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe development of new technologies could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nThe development of new kidney transplant technologies could decrease the need for dialysis services. Similarly, the development of new home dialysis technologies could decrease our in-center patient population and require us to focus more intensely on providing home dialysis services in more of our markets. See also \u201c-The Advancing American Kidney Health initiative may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and revenues.\u201d If new technologies are developed that require changes to our business structure or that otherwise decrease our in-center patient population, it could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nThere are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenues that we recognize that could impact the timing of our recognition of revenues or have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nThere are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenues that we recognize in a reporting period. Ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, uncertainty as to the amounts paid by various insurers with which we have no contracts and other payor issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation, complicate the billing and collection process. For example, in recognizing revenue from non-contracted payors, we estimate the transaction price based on usual and customary rates, reduced by contractual adjustments provided to those payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policy and/or implicit price concessions. In assessing the probability of claim payments, we review previous payment history and record a reserve, generally at the patient level, that results in an estimate of expected revenue such that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. When we later receive cash with respect to prior period patient claims, we are required to reconcile our contractual allowance estimates for discounts and price concessions with the cash we subsequently receive. The Audit Committee review that resulted in the Restatement found that in recording revenue based on expected payments from third-party payors during the Restated Periods, we did not appropriately reconcile contractual allowance estimates for discounts and price concessions with cash subsequently received in respect of prior period patient claims. We have taken and continue to take actions that we believe will remediate the material weaknesses that resulted in this failure to reconcile properly, but these actions have not had significant time to be deemed effective and may be ineffective to remediate the identified material weaknesses. See \u201c-Risks Related to the Restatement-We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, negatively impacting investor confidence.\u201d\nIn addition, laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex, changing and subject to interpretation. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for an extensive number of patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with federal health insurance programs are also subject to risk related to estimating amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from a secondary payor or the patient. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. If our estimates of revenues are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and amount of our recognition of revenues and have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not timely or accurately bill for our services, our revenues, bad debt expense and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a number of complex billing requirements. The process of providing medical care prior to receiving payment or determining a patient\u2019s ability to pay carries risks which may adversely affect our revenues, bad debt expense and cash flows. Payor billing requirements may differ by the type of payor as well as by the individual payor contract. Reimbursement for services we provide may be conditioned upon, amongst other requirements, properly coding and documenting services. Further, payors may fail to pay or refuse to pay for services even when properly billed. Additional factors that may influence our ability to receive reimbursement include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\npayor disputes regarding which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022\nvariations in the amount or type of coverage for similar services amongst various payors; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of new coding standards or requirements which may require more information or documentation.\nIf we are unable to meet payor billing requirements, reimbursement may be denied or delayed, which could adversely affect our revenues, bad debt expense and cash flows.\nFederal or state healthcare reform laws could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe ACA, among other things, increased the number of individuals with private insurance coverage and Medicaid, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud and abuse laws and encouraged the use of information technology.\nThe ACA has been the subject of extensive legislative and regulatory scrutiny, including efforts by Congress to repeal the ACA in its entirety, or to repeal, amend and replace a number of its provisions, as well as administrative actions delaying the effectiveness of key provisions. In December 2017, the U.S. President signed into law a provision repealing the penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate, which had required individuals to pay a fee if they failed to obtain a qualifying health insurance plan, effective for tax years beginning with 2019. While the ultimate impact of this change is unknown, it may result in an increase in the number of individuals without health insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legislative attempts to completely repeal the ACA have been unsuccessful to date, but there may be significant changes to the healthcare regulatory environment in the future, whether by administrative action or otherwise, that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there have been lawsuits filed by various stakeholders pertaining to the ACA that may have the effect of modifying or altering various parts of the law, or repealing the law in its entirety. For example, a federal district court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the individual mandate of the ACA was unconstitutional and inseverable from the ACA and thus that the remaining provisions of the ACA were also invalid. The court\u2019s ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and in March 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice stated in a legal filing with the Fifth Circuit that the district court\u2019s ruling that the ACA was invalid should be upheld. While the ACA remains in effect pending the appeal of this decision, we cannot predict whether the district court\u2019s ruling will be upheld or overturned or whether there will be further lawsuits that result in a modification or complete repeal of the ACA.\nIn recent years, some states have considered legislation, ballot initiatives or referendums, or policy changes that could, if implemented, impose additional requirements on our operations, including increases in the required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical personnel, minimum transition times between treatments and limits on how much patients may be charged for care. Proposition 8, a statewide ballot initiative filed in 2018 in California, would have limited the amount dialysis clinics could charge to 115% of the average treatment cost in California. Proposition 8 was not approved in the November 2018 election. Ballot initiatives similar to Proposition 8 were also proposed in Ohio and Arizona; however, neither initiative met the applicable requirements for inclusion on the state ballot for the November 2018 election. Although Proposition 8 and the Ohio and Arizona initiatives did not become law, similar legislation, ballot initiatives or referendums might be proposed in the future in these or other states. Changes such as those mandated by Proposition 8 and the Ohio and Arizona initiatives or similar future legislation, ballot initiatives or referendums, or related policy changes, could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating expense, require us to close dialysis centers or reduce shifts, and could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if not passed or approved, our efforts to oppose such measures could result in substantial costs to us.\nWe expect that additional federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future and cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to these changes. Full repeal or repeal of additional provisions of the ACA, any future healthcare reform legislation, including moving to a universal health insurance or \u201csingle payor\u201d system whereby health insurance is provided to all Americans under government programs, or adverse court decisions may increase our costs, limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, all of which are subject to change. These government regulations currently relate to, among other things:\n\u2022\ngovernment healthcare program participation requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirements related to reimbursement for patient services, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, rules addressing the priority of payors, signature and documentation requirements, and coding requirements;\n\u2022\nfederal and state anti-kickback laws, the federal physician self-referral prohibition statute (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) and analogous state physician self-referral statutes;\n\u2022\nfalse claims prohibitions for healthcare reimbursement programs and other fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, a provision in the ACA extending the federal False Claims Act to include, under certain circumstances, claims based on violations of the federal anti-kickback law and other civil monetary penalty laws, including laws prohibiting offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal healthcare program that such person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive any item or service reimbursable under such program;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws regarding record keeping requirements, privacy and security protections applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of protected health and other personally identifiable information, security breach notification requirements relating to protected health and other personally identifiable information, and standards for the exchange of electronic health information, electronic transactions and code sets and unique identifiers for providers;\n\u2022\ncorporate practice of medicine;\n\u2022\nlicensing and certification requirements applicable to our dialysis clinics;\n\u2022\ncertificate of need laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nregulation related to health, safety and environmental compliance, including medical waste disposal.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the strict requirements of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. As many of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations, there is an increased risk that we may be found to have violated them. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.\nIn addition, the laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. Any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards may not materially adversely affect our business.\nA review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities under existing or new healthcare laws could result in a determination that could materially adversely affect our operations. If such a determination were to be made, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings cash flows and financial condition including:\n\u2022\nsuspension, exclusion or termination of our participation in government payment programs;\n\u2022\nrefunds to the government and third-party payors of amounts received in violation of law or applicable program or contract requirements;\n\u2022\nloss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;\n\u2022\nloss of licenses or certificates of need required to operate healthcare clinics in the states in which we operate;\n\u2022\nreductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and pharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nfines, damages, monetary penalties, and civil or criminal liability for violations of anti-kickback laws, the Stark Law, state self-referral and anti-kickback prohibitions, and submission of false claims based on violations of law or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nbecoming subject to a corporate integrity agreement and the retention of an independent monitor to monitor compliance with such an agreement;\n\u2022\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their protected health information has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including HIPAA;\n\u2022\nmandated changes to our practices or procedures, including with respect to our billing and business practices, that significantly increase operating expenses;\n\u2022\ntermination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, including joint venture arrangements, medical director agreements, real estate leases, consulting agreements with physicians, or contracts with healthcare providers; and\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation, which could negatively impact our business relationships, affect our ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, affect our ability to obtain financing and decrease access to new business opportunities.\nHeightened federal and state investigation and enforcement efforts could subject us to increased costs of compliance and material adverse consequences.\nBoth federal and state government agencies, as well as commercial payors, have heightened and coordinated audits and administrative, civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare organizations. These investigations relate to a wide variety of topics, including cost reporting and billing practices, quality of care, financial reporting, financial relationships with referral sources, and medical necessity of services provided.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) have increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $11,181 to $22,363 per false claim or statement made after November 2, 2015 and $5,500 to $11,000 for claims or statements before that date, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings, including qui tam or whistleblower suits brought by private individuals on behalf of the government. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers\u2019 compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.\nOn August 18, 2016, CMS issued a request for information for public comment on concerns that some healthcare providers and provider-affiliated organizations may be steering patients eligible for, or receiving, Medicare and/or Medicaid benefits into ACA plans, including health insurance marketplace plans. The request also sought public comment about certain charities that provide assistance to patients seeking to enroll in private insurance coverage. CMS also sent letters to all Medicare-enrolled dialysis facilities and centers, including our facilities, informing them of this request for information.\nIn December 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) issued an interim final rule (\u201cIFR\u201d) that would have required dialysis facilities to make certain disclosures to insurers and patients in connection with ACA plans and would have effectively enabled insurers to reject charitable premium assistance payments. In January 2017, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining HHS from implementing the IFR, and in June 2017, at the request of the government, the court stayed the proceedings while HHS undertakes further rulemaking in order to replace the IFR with a new rule to be issued through a rule-making process. In June 2019, HHS sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget a proposed rule entitled \u201cConditions for Coverage for End-Stage Renal Disease Facilities-Third Party Payments.\u201d If this or any similar rule is issued and survives any potential court challenges, it could have a material adverse impact on us.\nState governments have also increased enforcement efforts against healthcare providers in connection with anti-fraud, physician self-referral and other laws. We may be especially susceptible to enforcement risks in states where we have large concentrations of business and in states in which we establish new JVs but in which we may be unfamiliar with the regulatory requirements. To the extent that we become the subject of such enforcement activities, in addition to any adverse legal consequences, such enforcement could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.\nIn particular, the dialysis services industry has been subject to scrutiny by the federal government. The increased scrutiny from regulators and insurers could adversely affect the enrollment of patients at our clinics in ACA plans and other individual commercial plans, cause additional reductions in our average reimbursement rates or result in additional limitations on our operations. Certain proceedings against companies in our industry have been and may in the future be filed under seal, such as a whistleblower action under the federal False Claims Act. Although we cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for these investigations to continue for a considerable period of time. Responding to these investigations can require substantial management attention and significant legal expense, which could materially adversely affect our operations. Further, in many cases the mere existence or announcement of any such inquiry could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such investigation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business or result in adverse publicity. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties against us, exclusion from future participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs, and, in some cases, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur arrangements and relationships with our nephrologist partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti-kickback statute and certain state anti-kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.\nWe endeavor to structure our JV arrangements and medical director agreements, including agreements with our chief medical officer, to comply with applicable laws and government regulations and applicable safe harbors. Our business model is focused on JVs with nephrologist partners, and we endeavor to structure these JVs in compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law and analogous state anti-kickback and self-referral laws, including the exceptions applicable to Medicare ESRD services. In addition, our chief medical officer has been granted stock options in ARA and a number of our nephrologist partners own shares of ARA as a result of common stock offerings that we have made. Substantially all of our JVs with physicians or physician groups also involve the provision of medical director services by our nephrologist partners to those clinics. Under Medicare regulations, each of our dialysis clinics is required to have an active medical director who is responsible for decision-making in analyzing core processes and patient outcomes and in stimulating a team approach to continuous quality improvement and patient safety. For these services, we retain a physician on an independent contractor basis at an annual fixed fee to serve as the medical director.\nWe believe that our relationships with our nephrologist partners, which include our medical directors, do not meet all of the elements of the safe harbors to the federal anti-kickback statute and may not meet all of the elements of analogous state safe harbors. Arrangements that do not meet all of the elements of a safe harbor do not necessarily violate the applicable anti-kickback statute but are susceptible to government scrutiny. The OIG has issued guidance expressing concerns about joint ventures with referring physicians and the Department of Justice has pursued actions relating to joint venture arrangements between physicians and other healthcare providers. Accordingly, there is some risk that the OIG, the Department of Justice or another government agency might investigate our JV arrangements and medical director contracts. In addition, if the government were to interpret the physician self-referral laws such that they viewed our operations to be in violation of such laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our arrangements with our nephrologist partners and medical directors were investigated and determined to violate the federal anti-kickback statute, Stark Law or analogous state laws, we could be required to restructure these relationships, which we may not be able to do successfully. We could become subject to a corporate integrity agreement, which requires costly external monitors and could require changes to our operations. We could also be subjected to civil and criminal penalties and severe monetary consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, including, but not limited to, the repayment of amounts received from Medicare by the offending clinics and the payment of penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Additionally, new federal or state laws could be enacted that would construe our relationships with our nephrologist partners as violating applicable law or result in the imposition of penalties against us or our facilities. If any of our business arrangements with nephrologist partners were alleged or deemed to violate the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws, or if new federal or state laws or regulations were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our arrangements are found to violate the Stark Law, it may subject us to government scrutiny or monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.\nAs the Stark Law prohibits physician self-referral for certain designated health services (\u201cDHS\u201d) and is a strict liability statute, we may be subject to liability due to the referral practices of our nephrologist partners. None of the Stark Law exceptions applicable to physician ownership interests in entities to which they make referrals for DHS apply to the kinds of ownership arrangements that our nephrologist partners hold in our JVs. If a center bills for DHS referred by our nephrologist partners, the claims would not be payable and the dialysis center could be subject to actions under the False Claims Act and the Stark Law penalties. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation-Stark Law.\u201d\nIf CMS determined that we have submitted claims in violation of the Stark Law, the claims would not be payable and we could be subject to penalties, some of which could be significant. In addition, it might be necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with our medical directors and to repurchase or to request the sale of ownership interests in our JVs held by our nephrologist partners or, alternatively, to refuse to accept referrals for DHS from these physicians. Any such penalties and restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our arrangements are found to violate state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting, we may not be able to operate in those states.\nThe laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state, and many states prohibit general business corporations, as we are, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. In some states, these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. We have endeavored to structure our activities and operations to avoid conflict with state law restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, and we have endeavored to structure all of our corporate and operational agreements to conform to any licensure requirements, fee-splitting and related corporate practice of medicine prohibitions. However, other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee-splitting despite the way we are structured. Were such allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and we may be required to restructure our contractual arrangements. We may not be able to operate in certain states, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to CMS certification, claims processing requirements and audits, and any adverse findings in a CMS review could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules related to claims submission, clinic and professional licensing requirements, cost reporting and payment processes impose complex and extensive requirements upon dialysis providers. A violation or departure from these requirements may result in government audits, lower reimbursements, overpayments, recoupments or voluntary repayments, and the potential loss of certification to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid program. CMS has increased the frequency and intensity of its certification inspections of dialysis clinics.\nWe are also subject to prepayment and post-payment reviews. CMS relies on a network of multi-state, regional contractors to process Medicare claims and audit healthcare providers. In addition, CMS has established a network of privately contracted auditors, called Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d), which conduct post-payment reviews to identify improper payments made by Medicare to providers. RACs are paid on a contingency basis for all overpayments identified and recovered. CMS also has a network of Zone Program Integrity Contractors, which investigate instances of suspected fraud, waste and abuse, and may refer cases to CMS for administrative action or to law enforcement for civil or criminal prosecution. If such claims are pursued by CMS or law enforcement, the penalties may be severe and may include, but not be limited to, substantial fines and exclusion from government healthcare programs.\nThe ACA established a requirement for providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification and quantification. Failure to report and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to False Claims Act liability. Providers and suppliers have a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to determine whether a Medicare overpayment exists and the amount of the overpayment. If we fail to identify, process and refund overpayments to the government in a timely manner, or if any audit, enforcement action or payment review reveals any failure to report and return an identified overpayment or a suspected\ninstance of fraud, waste or abuse, we could be subject to substantial costs and penalties, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nDelays in Medicare and state Medicaid certification of our dialysis clinics could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are required to obtain federal and state certification for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs before we can begin billing for patients treated in our clinics who are enrolled in government-based programs. Due to budgetary pressures and staffing limitations, significant delays in obtaining initial certification have occurred in some states, including for our clinics, and additional delays may occur in the future. Failures or delays in obtaining certification, particularly if they become more widespread, could cause significant delays in our ability to bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, cause us to incur write-offs of investments or accelerate the recognition of lease obligations in the event we have to close clinics or our clinics\u2019 operating performance deteriorates. This could have an adverse effect on our growth and operating results. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, allows for independent credit organizations approved by HHS to accredit dialysis facilities and imposes certain timing requirements regarding the initiation of initial surveys to determine if certain conditions and requirements for payment have been satisfied, but the ultimate impact of these changes cannot be predicted.\nWe may be required, as a result of future changes in our ownership structure, to comply with notification and reapplication requirements in order to maintain our licenses, permits, certifications or other authorizations to operate, and failure to do so, or an allegation that we have failed to do so, could result in payment delays, forfeitures of payments or civil and criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws with which we must comply in order to maintain authorization to provide, or receive payment for, our services. Compliance with such requirements is complicated by the fact that such requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and in some cases are not uniformly applied or interpreted even within the same jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to delays in payment and refund requests as well as civil or criminal penalties.\nIn certain jurisdictions, changes in our ownership structure, including changes in beneficial ownership of our company, require pre-transaction or post-transaction notification to state governmental licensing and certification agencies. Relevant laws in some jurisdictions may also require reapplication or reenrollment and approval to maintain or renew our licensure, certification, contracts or other operating authority. The extent of such notices and filings may vary in each jurisdiction in which we operate.\nWhile we intend to comply with any notification, reenrollment or reapplication requirements that may result from future changes in our ownership structure, the agencies that administer these programs could find that we have failed to comply in some manner. A finding of non-compliance and any resulting payment delays, refund demands or other sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause our senior management has been key to our growth and success, we may be materially adversely affected if we lose any member of our senior management.\nWe are dependent on our senior management. Because our senior management has contributed to our growth since inception, the loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient members of qualified management or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf patients no longer choose to use our dialysis clinics, or if a significant number of physicians or hospitals were to cease recommending our dialysis clinics to patients, our revenues would decrease.\nOur business is dependent upon patients choosing our clinics as the location for their treatments. Patients may select a clinic based, in part, on the recommendation of their physician. We believe that physicians and other clinicians typically consider a number of factors when recommending a particular dialysis facility to an ESRD patient, including, but not limited to, the quality of care at a clinic, the competency of a clinic\u2019s staff, convenient scheduling and a clinic\u2019s location and physical condition. Physicians may change their facility recommendations at any time, which may result in the transfer of our existing patients to competing clinics, including clinics established by the physicians themselves. Our business also depends on recommendations by hospitals, managed care plans, other payors and other healthcare institutions. If a significant number of providers cease recommending their patients to our clinics, this would reduce our revenue and could materially adversely affect our overall operations.\nWe depend on our relationships with our medical directors. Our ability to provide medical services at our facilities would be impaired and our revenues reduced if we were not able to maintain these relationships.\nEach of our clinics is required by applicable regulations to have a medical director. Our ability to attract physicians to become medical directors at our clinics is essential to the growth of our business. Our business depends, in part, on the strength of our relationships with these physicians. Our revenues would be reduced if we lost relationships with key medical directors or groups of medical directors. If we were not able to attract new medical directors or maintain existing medical director relationships, our ability to provide medical services at our facilities would be impaired. Our business also depends on the efforts and success of the physicians who are medical directors at our clinics. The efforts of these medical directors directly correlate to the patient satisfaction and operating metrics of our clinics. Any failure of these medical directors to maintain the quality of medical care provided or to otherwise adhere to professional guidelines at our clinics or any damage to the reputation of a key medical director or group of medical directors could damage our reputation, subject us to liability and significantly reduce our revenues.\nThe Medicare conditions for coverage for ESRD facilities require that our medical directors be board-certified in internal medicine or pediatrics by a professional board and complete a board-approved training program in nephrology. Where a physician is not available with these qualifications, we seek a waiver of this requirement for our medical director from CMS. For a number of our facilities, physicians with these qualifications are not available, and we have obtained waivers from CMS for the medical directors of these facilities. If we are unable to attract physicians with these qualifications to become our medical directors or are unable to obtain waivers of this requirement for our medical directors, it could result in the closure of facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot renew our medical director agreements or enforce the noncompetition provisions of our medical director agreements, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur medical director contracts are typically for fixed initial ten-year periods with automatic renewal options. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us. We may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships in an effort to meet the safe harbor provisions of the anti-kickback statute, Stark Law and other similar laws. These actions could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship which could lead to the early termination of the agreement. If a medical director agreement terminates, whether before or at the end of its term, we may be unable to find a replacement medical director with comparable qualifications, and the business, results of operations, financial condition and quality of medical services of the facility may be adversely affected.\nOur medical director agreements generally provide for noncompetition restrictions prohibiting the medical directors from owning an interest in or serving as a medical director of a competing facility within specified geographical areas for specified periods of time. If we are unable to enforce the noncompetition provisions contained in our medical director agreements, it is possible that these medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis clinics in competition with ours. Our inability to enforce noncompetition provisions and related patient attrition could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to substantial competition and could be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively in the dialysis services industry.\nThe dialysis services industry is highly competitive. Because of the lack of barriers to entry into the dialysis services business and the ability of nephrologists to be medical directors for their own clinics, competition in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. According to CMS data, there were more than 7,100 dialysis clinics in the United States as of November 1, 2018. We face competition from large and medium-sized providers for patients and for the acquisition of existing dialysis clinics. We face particularly intense competition for the identification of nephrologists, whether as attending physicians, medical directors or nephrologist partners. In many instances, our competitors have taken steps to include comprehensive non-competition provisions within various agreements, thereby limiting the ability of physicians to serve as medical directors or potential joint venture partners for competing dialysis clinics. These non-competition provisions often contain both time and geographic limitations during the term of the agreement and for a period of years thereafter. Such non-competition provisions may limit our ability to compete effectively for nephrologists. In addition, our reputation and relationships with nephrologists may be adversely impacted by the Restatement, the SEC Investigation, class action and derivative lawsuits and other issues in connection with the Restatement, which could lead to\nnephrologists being less willing to become or continue to serve as an attending physician, nephrologist partner or medical director of our clinics.\nThe dialysis services industry has undergone rapid consolidation. We estimate that, as of the end of 2018, the three largest for-profit dialysis providers, Fresenius Medical Care, DaVita and US Renal Care, together accounted for approximately 80% of the dialysis patients in the United States. We estimate that the largest not-for-profit provider of dialysis services, Dialysis Clinic, Inc., accounted for approximately 3% of the dialysis patients in the United States and that hospital-based providers accounted for approximately 4% of the dialysis patients in the United States, while independent providers and small- and medium-sized dialysis organizations, including our company, collectively accounted for the remainder. Consolidation continues to increase, thereby intensifying competition in the dialysis services industry. If we are unable to compete effectively in the dialysis services industry, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur competitors have increasingly adopted a JV model and compete with us for establishing de novo clinics, acquiring existing dialysis clinics and engaging medical directors, which could materially adversely impact our growth prospects.\nThe development, acquisition and operation of dialysis clinics is highly competitive. Our competition comes from other dialysis clinics, many of which are owned by much larger public companies, small to mid-sized private companies, acute care hospitals, nursing homes and physician groups. The dialysis services industry is rapidly consolidating, resulting in several large dialysis services companies competing with us for the acquisition of existing dialysis clinics and the development of relationships with nephrologists to serve as medical directors for new clinics. Several dialysis companies, including some of our largest competitors, have adopted a JV model of dialysis clinic ownership, resulting in increased competition in the development, acquisition and operation of JV dialysis clinics. Competition to develop clinics using a JV model could materially adversely affect our growth as well as our operating results and financial condition. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, more dialysis clinics, a significantly larger patient base and are vertically integrated, and, accordingly may be able to achieve better economies of scale by asserting leverage against their suppliers, payors and other commercial parties. In addition, because of the ease of entry into the dialysis business and the ability of physicians to serve as medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. We may experience competition from former medical directors or attending physicians who open their own dialysis centers. If we face a reduction in the number of our medical directors or nephrologist partners, it could adversely affect our business.\nDeteriorations in economic conditions, particularly in states where we operate a large number of clinics, as well as disruptions in the financial markets or the effects of natural or other disasters or adverse weather events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding, could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nDeteriorations in economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from these conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Our business may be particularly sensitive to economic conditions in certain states in which we operate a large number of clinics, such as Florida (44 clinics), Texas (26 clinics), Georgia (20 clinics), Ohio (17 clinics), Pennsylvania (16 clinics), Massachusetts (14 clinics), Colorado (13 clinics), South Carolina (11 clinics) and others. In addition, to the extent that commercial payors are adversely affected by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, delays in fee collections and a reduction in the amounts we are able to collect.\nFurther, some of our dialysis clinics may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural or other disasters or adverse weather events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding. For example, we operate 44 clinics in Florida and 26 clinics in Texas, states that have in the past experienced and may in the future experience hurricanes. Natural or other disasters or adverse weather events could significantly damage or destroy our facilities, disrupt operations, increase our costs to maintain operations and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations.\nAny or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of these events, which currently cannot be anticipated, could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection, processing, storage, access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable, protected health or other sensitive or confidential information, our business, reputation and profitability could suffer.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive or confidential information that is collected, stored, maintained, received or transmitted in any form or media is a major issue in the healthcare industry. Along with our own confidential data and information, we collect, process, use and store a large amount of such hard-copy and electronic data and information from our patients and employees. We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, processing, sharing, access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable information, including protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d). Such laws and regulations include but are not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), and state data breach disclosure laws. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly protect the integrity and security of our facilities and systems and the data located within them, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, or if our third-party service providers fail to do any of the foregoing with respect to data and information accessed, used or collected on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrivacy laws, including those that specifically cover PHI, are changing rapidly and subject to differing interpretations. New laws, regulations and standards relating to privacy and security, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare-related data, and the cost of monitoring and complying with such laws, regulations and standards could be significant. In addition, governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and security could be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations in a manner adverse to us. If we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to threatened or actual civil or criminal proceedings, investigations, actions, monetary fines, civil penalties or sanctions by government entities, consumer advocacy groups, private individuals or others.\nInformation security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. Our business and operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service providers, including sensitive personal information, such as PHI, social security numbers and credit card information of our patients, physicians, business partners and others.\nOur facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers, as well as the data that they hold, may be vulnerable to security attacks and breaches caused by acts of vandalism, fraud or theft, computer viruses, criminal activity, coordinated attacks by activist entities or others, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable services or sabotage systems change frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world and generally are not recognized until launched against us, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security that may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations.\nAny security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, corruption or other unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable, protected health or other sensitive or confidential information, including financial data, competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data, whether suffered by us or one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events to us or a third-party service provider could result in business interruptions and delays, cessations in the availability of systems and our ability to provide services, potential liability and regulatory action, harm or loss to our reputation and relationships with our patients, physicians, vendors and other business partners, investigations, monetary fines, civil or criminal suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions, as well as significant costs, including as they relate to legal requirements to disclose the breach publicly, repairing any system damage, incentives offered to patients or others to maintain business relationships after a breach and the implementation of measures to prevent future breaches. Any of the foregoing may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our business reputation. In addition, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive or confidential information, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nComplications associated with implementing an electronic medical records system could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nWe have selected an electronic medical record (\u201cEMR\u201d) system for implementation at an increasing number of our facilities in the future. The cost of implementing an EMR system at our facilities may be significant, and the system\u2019s launch may be unsuccessful or may result in inefficiencies. Defects or design issues with the EMR may increase costs and subject us to additional regulatory risks. For example, problems with system implementation and operation may increase the likelihood of or cause noncompliance with federal and state security and privacy laws such as HIPAA and with requirements imposed by third-party payors. If such issues were to arise, they could materially adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nWe may be subject to liability claims for malpractice, professional liability and other matters that could harm our reputation or result in damages and other expenses not covered by insurance that could adversely impact us.\nOur business, and in particular the administration of dialysis services to patients subjects us to litigation and liability for damages based on an allegation of malpractice, professional negligence in the performance of our treatment and related services, the acts or omissions of our employees, or other matters. Our exposure to this litigation and liability for damages increases with growth in the number of our clinics and treatments performed. Potential judgments, settlements or costs relating to potential future claims, complaints or lawsuits could result in substantial damages and could subject us to the incurrence of significant fees and costs. In addition, our business, reputation, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity in connection with such claims, including claims related to adverse patient events, contractual disputes, professional and general liability, workplace behavior or other personnel matters and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 duties. We maintain liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our operations, including professional and general liability insurance. Our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a cost satisfactory to us to allow for the maintenance of adequate levels of insurance. If we incur damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable insurance coverage or if one or more successful claims against us exceeds the coverage limit of our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance costs have been increasing substantially over the last several years, and our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims and losses.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks in our business, including professional liability insurance, which is subject to deductibles. The premiums and deductibles under our insurance program have been increasing over the last several years as a result of litigation activity since our IPO and general business rate increases. We are unable to predict further increases in premiums and deductibles, but based on recent experience, we expect further increases in premiums and deductibles, which could adversely impact our earnings. The liability exposure of operations in the healthcare services industry has increased, resulting not only in increased premiums but also in limitations on the liability covered by insurance carriers. We may not be able to obtain necessary or sufficient insurance coverage for our operations upon expiration of our insurance policies, or obtain any insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be materially and adversely affected by the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers.\nMaterial decisions regarding our dialysis clinics may require the consent of our joint venture partners, and we may not be able to resolve disputes.\nOur joint venture partners, who may be single practitioners, an affiliated group of nephrologists, hospitals or multi-practice institutions, participate in material strategic and operating decisions we make for our clinics. For example, we generally must obtain the consent of our joint venture partners before making any material amendments to the operating agreement for the dialysis clinic or admitting additional members. The operating agreement for a clinic may provide that we cannot take certain specified actions affecting that clinic without the consent of the joint venture partner(s) for that clinic. Such actions may include (i) a sale, transfer, liquidation or reorganization of all or substantially all of the clinic, or a merger or dissolution of the clinic, (ii) a lease of all or substantially all of the clinic, (iii) the admission of a new or substituted member, (iv) an amendment or modification of the applicable operating agreement or the constituent documents for the clinic, (v) certain transactions with affiliates, (vi) any distribution in kind of assets of the clinic, (vii) any capital calls except to the extent specifically provided, (viii) any hiring or firing of certain key employees of the clinic, (ix) entering into borrowing arrangements on behalf of the clinic or incurring other liabilities, in each case, exceeding specified amounts, (x) entering into any material agreements on behalf of the clinic where annual payments exceed a specified amount, (xi) any transfer of all or any part of a membership interest in the clinic other than a permitted transfer under the operating agreement and (xii) any\nsubstantial expansion or capital improvements to the clinic. The rights of our joint venture partners to approve material decisions could limit our ability to take actions that we believe are in our best interest and the best interest of the dialysis clinic. Some of our joint venture partners may have interests in multiple clinics, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully negotiate or resolve disputes with such partners to the extent they have approval rights over material decisions for a number of clinics. We may not be able to resolve favorably, or at all, any dispute regarding material decisions with our joint venture partners.\nWe may be required to purchase the ownership interests of our nephrologist partners, which may require additional debt or equity financing.\nA substantial number of our JV operating agreements grant our nephrologist partners rights to require us to purchase their ownership interests, at the estimated fair value as defined within the applicable JV operating agreement, at certain set times or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. Except in the case of event-based triggers and a limited number of time-based triggers, our nephrologist partners in each JV are generally required to collectively maintain a minimum percentage, most commonly at least 20%, of the total outstanding membership interests in the clinic following the exercise of their put rights. Event-based triggers of these rights in various JV operating agreements may include the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of a clinic, closure of the clinic, change of control of us or of a clinic, departure of key executives, third-party members\u2019 death, disability, bankruptcy, retirement, material breach of the operating agreement or if third-party members are dissolved and other events. Time-based triggers give nephrologist partners at certain of our clinics the option to require us to purchase previously agreed upon percentages of their ownership interests at certain set dates. The timing of when some of the time-based put rights are exercisable may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as those noted above.\nThe estimate of the fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which these obligations may ultimately be settled in the future. The estimated fair values of the interests subject to these put provisions can also fluctuate, and the implied multiple of earnings at which these obligations may be settled will vary depending upon clinic performance, market conditions and access to the credit and capital markets. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded liabilities of approximately $101.1 million for all existing time-based put obligations, of which we have estimated approximately $11.2 million were accelerated as a result of physicians with IPO put rights having elected to exercise, or who may potentially exercise, the puts, and approximately $28.0 million for all existing event-based put obligations to our nephrologist partners. The funds required to honor our put obligations may make it difficult for us to meet our other debt obligations, including obligations under our credit facilities, or could require us to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional common stock to fund such purchases.\nIn certain limited circumstances some of our nephrologist partners may have the right to purchase our JV ownership interests, which rights could affect the value of our company.\nIn certain limited circumstances, some of our JV operating agreements grant our nephrologist partners rights to purchase our ownership interests in the applicable JV. A limited number of our JV operating agreements give our nephrologist partners the right to purchase all of our membership interests within a specified period, at fair market value or otherwise dissolve the JV. In the event of a change of control transaction, such as a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or stock to a third party, or the departure of key executives, some of our nephrologist partners would have the right to purchase all of our ownership interests in the applicable JV or require us to offer to sell our ownership interests in the applicable JV to them at a purchase price typically based, in whole or in part, on the clinic valuation or transaction valuation. These provisions could adversely affect the value of our company to a potential acquirer and our ability to fully realize the value of a change of control transaction.\nWe may have a special legal responsibility to our nephrologist partners, which may conflict with, and prevent us from acting solely in, our own best interests.\nWe generally hold our ownership interests in facilities through JVs in which we maintain an ownership interest along with physicians. As majority managing member of most of our JVs, we may have fiduciary duties under state laws to manage these entities in the best interests of the minority interest holders. We may encounter conflicts between our responsibility to further the interests of these nephrologist partners and our own best interests. For example, we have entered into management agreements to provide management services to the dialysis clinics in exchange for a fee. Disputes may arise as to the nature of the services to be provided or the amount of the fee to be paid. Disputes may also arise between us and our nephrologist partners with respect to a particular business decision or regarding the interpretation of the provisions of the applicable JV operating agreement. In addition, disputes may arise as to the amounts and timing of distributions we make to our nephrologist partners. In these cases, we may be obligated to exercise reasonable, good faith judgment to resolve the disputes and may not\nbe free to act solely in our own best interests. We have not implemented any measures to resolve these conflicts if they arise. If we are unable to resolve a dispute on terms favorable or satisfactory to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nShortages of qualified skilled clinical personnel, or higher than normal turnover rates, could affect our ability to grow and deliver quality, timely and cost-effective care services.\nWe depend on qualified nurses and other skilled clinical personnel to provide quality service to patients in our clinics. Competition is intense for qualified nurses, technical staff and nephrologists. We depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled clinical personnel to support our growth and generate revenues. There is currently a shortage of skilled clinical personnel in many of the markets in which we operate our clinics as well as markets in which we are considering opening new clinics. This nursing shortage may adversely affect our ability to grow or, in some cases, to replace existing staff, thereby leading to disruptions in our services. In addition, this shortage of skilled clinical personnel and the more stressful working conditions it creates for those remaining in the profession are increasingly viewed as a threat to patient safety and may trigger the adoption of state and federal laws and regulations intended to reduce that risk. For example, some states have adopted or are considering legislation that would prohibit forced overtime for nurses or establish mandatory staffing level requirements.\nIn response to the shortage of skilled clinical personnel, we have increased and are likely to have to continue to increase our wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses or to engage contract nurses at a higher expense until we hire permanent staff nurses. We may not be able to increase the rates we charge to offset increased costs. The shortage of skilled clinical personnel may in the future delay our ability to achieve our operational goals at a dialysis clinic by limiting the number of patients we are able to service. The shortage of skilled clinical personnel also makes it difficult for us in some markets to reduce personnel expense at our clinics by implementing a temporary reduction in the size of the skilled clinical personnel staff during periods of reduced patient admissions and procedure volumes. In addition, we believe that retention of skilled clinical personnel is an important factor in a patient\u2019s decision to continue receiving treatment at one of our clinics. If we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nGrowing numbers of skilled clinical personnel are also joining unions that threaten and sometimes call work stoppages. Although we do not currently directly employ personnel that are members of a union, we lease employees in New York and the District of Columbia that are members of unions. Accordingly, we are required to abide by certain laws, regulations and procedures in our interactions with these employees. Union organizing activities at our clinics could adversely affect our operating costs, our employee relations, productivity, earnings and cash flows. If union organizing activities or other national or local trends result in an increase in labor and employment costs or claims, including class action lawsuits, our operating costs, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, expose us to significant interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated long-term indebtedness of $517.5 million. Our high level of indebtedness could, among other consequences:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including our credit facilities, exposing us to the risk of default, which could result in a foreclosure on our assets, which, in turn, would negatively affect our ability to operate as a going concern;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, such as capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes.\nSubstantially all of our indebtedness is floating rate debt. We are exposed to interest rate volatility to the extent such interest rate risk is not hedged. We have and may continue to enter into swaps or other derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to floating interest rates as described under \u201c-We utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty creditworthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\u201d\nOur debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions, and our failure to comply with these restrictions may subject us to increased interest expense, lender consent and amendment costs or other adverse financial consequences.\nOur credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022make investments and sell assets;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022purchase our stock;\n\u2022engage in business activities unrelated to our current business;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, under our credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet those ratios and tests. We are also required under our credit facilities to timely deliver our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Due to the factors that led to the Restatement and our material weaknesses, we have not been able to timely deliver our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, and we have determined that the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and for the fiscal quarters in 2017 and 2018 that we had previously delivered to the lenders under our credit facilities were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These failures on our part resulted in defaults under our credit facilities, our third-party clinic level debt and our Assigned Clinic Loans (as defined in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Impact of the IPO and Certain Legal Matters\u201d). See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt Facilities.\u201d To remedy these defaults, we have entered into an amendment to our credit facilities, whereby we have provided lenders with consent fees, are subject to increased constraints on our ability to borrow under our credit facilities and are required to pay higher interest costs. To the extent that we fail to meet our requirements to timely deliver financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP in future periods, to comply with our financial covenants, to pay interest or principal when due or to meet other covenants and requirements contained within our credit facilities, we may default under one or more of our credit facilities. In particular, under the amendment to our credit facilities, if it is determined that we failed to satisfy the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio at the time of borrowing under our revolving credit facility or when required on or after the last day of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 or the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019, an event of default will be deemed to have occurred. In addition, to remedy the defaults under our third-party clinic level debt, we obtained individual waivers or forbearances from substantially all of our third-party clinic lenders, and continue to seek waivers or forbearances from the remaining lenders. The total balance of clinic-level debt as of December 31, 2018 for which we have not obtained waivers through the date of these consolidated financial statements amounts to approximately $4.2 million. We have not sought a formal waiver for the outstanding Assigned Clinic Loans, which are held by Term Loan Holdings LLC, an entity owned by our pre-IPO stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we had $5.1 million of outstanding Assigned Clinic Loans.\nA breach of any of those requirements or covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities and require further amendments, leading to increases in consent fees to lenders or increased interest costs, the imposition of additional constraints on borrowing or potentially more serious liquidity constraints and adverse financial consequences. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be due and payable immediately. This, in turn, could cause our other debt, including debt under our credit facilities, to become due and payable as a result of cross-default or acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us.\nWe are a holding company. We have no operations of our own and derive all of our revenues and cash flow from our joint venture and other subsidiaries. We depend on our joint venture subsidiaries for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness when such payments are due. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing current and future indebtedness and our joint ventures, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, limit our ability to obtain cash from our joint ventures. Such agreements, including the agreements governing our credit facilities and joint ventures, may restrict our subsidiaries from providing us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund interest and principal payments on our indebtedness when due. In addition, our operating agreements generally provide that distributions may only be made to us if at the same time we make pro rata distributions to our joint venture partners, and accordingly, a significant portion of our cash flows is used to make distributions to our joint venture partners and is not available to service our indebtedness. Further, if our subsidiaries\u2019 operating performance declines or if our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments on indebtedness, or if our subsidiaries otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing their indebtedness, our subsidiaries could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. Under such a scenario, our subsidiaries would need to seek to obtain waivers from their lenders to avoid being in default, which they may not be able to obtain. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, and our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness, and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty creditworthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\nIn March 2017, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $133 million and two interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $147 million, as a means of reducing our exposure to the floating interest rate component on $440 million of our variable rate debt under our term loans. The swap and interest rate caps are designated as a cash flow hedge, with a termination date of March 31, 2021. We may enter into additional interest rate swaps or other derivative financial instruments to further limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. Such instruments may result in economic losses should interest rates decline to a point lower than our fixed rate commitments. We will be exposed to credit-related losses, which could impact our results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the creditworthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments.\nWe are required to pay our pre-IPO stockholders for certain tax benefits, which amounts are expected to be material.\nIn connection with our initial public offering in April 2016 (\u201cIPO\u201d), we entered into an income tax receivable agreement (the \u201cTRA\u201d) for the benefit of our pre-IPO stockholders that provides for the payment by us to our pre-IPO stockholders on a pro rata basis of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of any deductions (including net operating losses resulting from such deductions) attributable to the\nexercise of (or any payment, including any dividend equivalent right or payment, in respect of) any compensatory stock option issued by us that was outstanding (whether vested or unvested) as of the day before the date of our IPO prospectus (such stock options, \u201cRelevant Stock Options\u201d and such deductions, \u201cOption Deductions\u201d).\nThese payment obligations are our obligations and not obligations of any of our subsidiaries. The actual amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, whether and when any Relevant Stock Options are exercised and the value of our common stock at the time of such exercise. We expect that during the term of the TRA the payments that we make will be material. Such payments will reduce the liquidity that would otherwise have been available to us. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Income Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nIn addition, the TRA provides that upon certain mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, asset sales, other changes of control (including changes of continuing directors) or our complete liquidation, the TRA is terminable with respect to certain Relevant Stock Options at the election of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. (together with its affiliates, \u201cCenterbridge\u201d) (or its assignee). If Centerbridge (or its assignee) elects to terminate the TRA with respect to such Relevant Stock Options, we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the TRA with respect to such Relevant Stock Options, which payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. Upon such termination, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise payable to stockholders in a change of control transaction or delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, asset sales or other changes of control. If Centerbridge (or its assignee) does not elect to terminate the TRA with respect to such Relevant Stock Options upon a change of control, subsequent payments under the TRA will be calculated assuming that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize any available Option Deductions, in which case we may be required to make payments under the TRA that exceed our actual cash savings as a result of the Option Deductions in the taxable year.\nThe TRA provides that in the event that we breach any of our material obligations under it, whether as a result of our failure to make any payment when due (subject to a specified cure period), failure to honor any other material obligation under it or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of it in a case commenced under the United States Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then all our payment and other obligations under the TRA could be accelerated and become due and payable applying the same assumptions described above. Such payments could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings under the TRA.\nAdditionally, we generally have the right to terminate the TRA. If we terminate the TRA, our payment and other obligations under the TRA will be accelerated and will become due and payable, also applying assumptions similar to those described above, except that if we terminate the TRA at a time during which any Relevant Stock Options remain outstanding, the value of the common stock that would be delivered as a result of the exercise of such Relevant Stock Options will be assumed to be the value of our common stock at such time plus a premium on such value, determined as of the date the TRA is terminated (the \u201cApplicable Premium\u201d). The Applicable Premium is 20% if we terminate the TRA after the third anniversary but on or before the fourth anniversary of the date we entered into the TRA, 10% if we terminate the TRA after the fourth anniversary but on or before the fifth anniversary of such date and 0% if we terminate the TRA after the fifth anniversary of such date. Any such termination payments could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings under the TRA.\nOur pre-IPO stockholders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the TRA if the tax benefits giving rise to any payments under the TRA are subsequently disallowed (although future payments would be adjusted to the extent possible to reflect the result of such disallowance). As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the TRA in excess of our cash tax savings.\nBecause we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the TRA is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA, such payments will generally accrue interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 500 basis points from the due date until paid; however, if we are unable to make payments under the TRA because we do not have sufficient cash to make such payments as a result of limitations imposed by existing credit agreements to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party, such payments will accrue interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points from the due date until paid.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.\nFrom time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our patients, business partners and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities.\nAny changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse development or outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially. As a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, since January 1, 2018, the trading price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange has ranged from a low of $5.48 to a high of $24.07 through September 3, 2019. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of the value of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nperformance of third parties on whom we rely to operate our clinics, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe success of, and fluctuation in, the revenue generated from our clinics;\n\u2022\nexecution of our operations and other aspects of our business plan;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors and the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of competing clinics;\n\u2022\nannouncements by third parties or governmental authorities of significant claims or proceedings against us or investigations of us;\n\u2022\nregulatory and reimbursement developments in the United States;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel and nephrologist partners; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions in government operations or general domestic and international economic conditions unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. Any securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion, and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including pursuant to our credit agreement. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common shares could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have a total of 32,603,846 shares of common stock outstanding. Of those shares, 13,150,192 shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), though certain shares remain subject to continued service vesting requirements. The remaining 19,453,654 shares are held by our affiliates, including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates (including Centerbridge) and are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144. Pursuant to our amended and restated registration rights agreement, we have filed and had declared effective a registration statement with the SEC for the resale of up to 19,017,413 shares of our common stock by Centerbridge, Joe Carlucci, our Chief Executive Officer, and Syed Kamal, our President. Shares covered by such registration statement represented approximately 59% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. These outstanding shares of common stock will become freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon any sale pursuant to the registration statement. However, because we were unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 with the SEC on a timely basis, none of Centerbridge or Messrs. Carlucci or Kamal will be able to use such registration statement for resales of stock held by them until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for one year.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders sell their shares pursuant to the registration statement, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have issued outstanding options to purchase 5,011,191 shares of our common stock. In addition, we had 2,056,620 shares reserved for future issuance under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. We have registered all of the common stock subject to outstanding stock options and other equity awards, as well as shares reserved for future issuance, under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Under SEC regulations, our failure to timely file with the SEC this Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 resulted in the suspension of the availability of our registration statement on Form S-8 for issuances of equity awards under our employee and director equity incentive plans, including our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or to allow our employees to exercise any options to purchase our common stock that they hold using the Form S-8. However, once we are deemed to have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act, shares registered under such registration statements will be generally\navailable for sale in the open market, subject to our trading policies and, in the case of shares held by our officers and directors, to volume limits under Rule 144.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nCenterbridge controls us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Centerbridge beneficially owns approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock. Investment funds associated with or designated by Centerbridge have the ability to elect a majority of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, Centerbridge may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, Centerbridge could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness. Centerbridge may direct us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy, including with respect to, among other things, clinic openings and closings, sales of other assets, employee headcount levels and initiatives to reduce costs and expenses.\nCenterbridge is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that neither Centerbridge nor any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) nor his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate.\nSo long as Centerbridge continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, Centerbridge will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. In addition, so long as Centerbridge continues to maintain this ownership, it will be able effectively to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules and the rules of the SEC. As a result, we qualify for, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nCenterbridge beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of directors meeting the NYSE independence standards applicable to compensation committee members with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be responsible for hiring and overseeing of persons acting as compensation consultants and be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging such persons;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that it have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees.\nOur Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee do not currently consist entirely of independent directors because we are relying on the exemptions for controlled companies. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, amended and restated stockholders agreement and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and amended and restated stockholders agreement contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call a special stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nallowing the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, if Centerbridge holds less than 40% in voting power of the stock of our company; and\n\u2022\nspecifying that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, if Centerbridge holds less than 40% in voting power of the stock of our company but still has the right to nominate directors to, or has its director nominees serving on, our board of directors.\nAdditionally, we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a similar provision, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally a person that together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of which the person became an interested stockholder), unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that Centerbridge and any of its respective direct or indirect transferees, and any group as to which such persons are party, do not constitute interested stockholders for purposes of this provision.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nexemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022\nexemption from the requirements of holding non-binding stockholder votes on executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022\nexemption from any rules requiring mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis and, unless the SEC otherwise determines, any future audit rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nWe will be an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2021, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the first day of the first fiscal year after we have more than $700 million in aggregate market value of outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we continue to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will continue to be required to devote substantial time to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. These costs will further increase after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting will continue to become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure the effectiveness of these controls. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2018 in connection with the Restatement, which has and continues to require management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to remediation efforts, as described in \u201c-Risks Related to the Restatement-We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, negatively impacting investor confidence.\u201d In addition, it may become more difficult or more costly for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance because of the Restatement, the increasing complexity of our business and other factors, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage when we renew our current policy.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, as a public company, we are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and in the future our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As described above, as an emerging growth company, we may not need to comply with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404 for a number of years. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and that management expend time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the\nrequirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWhen the available exemptions under the JOBS Act, as described above, cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with the applicable regulatory and corporate governance requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may continue to incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.", "PERMNO": 16024, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "ARA"}
