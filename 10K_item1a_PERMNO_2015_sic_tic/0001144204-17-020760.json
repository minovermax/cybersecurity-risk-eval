{"cik": "1037649", "company": "INTERLEUKIN GENETICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our commercial success will depend at least in part on our ability to obtain appropriate patent protection on our therapeutic and diagnostic products and methods and our ability to avoid infringing on the intellectual property of others.\nWe have been granted a number of corresponding foreign patents and have a number of foreign counterparts of our U.S. patents and patent applications pending.\nCompetition\nThe competition in the field of personalized health is changing. The markets and customer base are not well established. There are a number of companies involved in identifying and commercializing genetic markers. The companies differ in product end points and target customers. There are companies that market individual condition genetic tests for complex diseases to consumers and those that sell only to physicians. There are companies that market testing services for rare monogenic diseases mainly to physicians. There are companies that sell genome-scanning services to provide customers (usually the consumer directly) reports on large numbers of SNPs or the person\u2019s entire genome. There are also technology platform companies that sell SNP testing equipment.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of any genetic test is its perceived benefit by the user, price (potentially including availability of reimbursement) and the level of market acceptance. In the case of newly introduced products requiring \u201cchange of behavior\u201d (such as genetic risk assessment tests), we believe the presence of multiple competitors may accelerate market acceptance and penetration through increasing awareness. Moreover, two different genetic risk assessment tests for the same disease may in fact test or measure different components, and thus, actually be complementary when given in parallel as an overall assessment of risk, rather than being competitive with each other. Furthermore, the primary focus of most companies in the field is performing gene-identification research for pharmaceutical companies for therapeutic purposes, with genetic risk assessment testing being a secondary goal. In contrast, our primary business focus is developing and commercializing genetic risk assessment tests for health risks and forward-integrating these tests with additional products and services.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see \u201cRisks Related to Our Business, Our Financial Results and Need for Financing - We could become subject to intense competition from other companies, which may damage our business.\u201d under \"Risk Factors\" below in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulation\nFederal and state governmental authorities regulate the testing services that we provide. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation. We intend to comply with all applicable government regulations and believe that we are currently in compliance. We cannot predict what new legislation or regulations governing our operations will be enacted by legislative bodies or promulgated by agencies that regulate its activities, or what changes in interpretations of existing regulations may be adopted. In particular, the FDA\u2019s approach to regulating laboratory developed tests is evolving, including such tests that are made available directly to the consumer, and we are in discussions with the FDA about how our tests, primarily certain of our Inherent Health tests, may be impacted, as discussed further in the \u201cGovernment Regulation - Food and Drug Administration\u201d section below.\nCLIA and Other Laboratory Licensure\nOur clinical laboratory must hold certain licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or assessment of health are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). CLIA requires such a laboratory to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities, administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. Requirements for testing under CLIA vary based on the level of complexity of the testing performed. Laboratories performing high complexity tests, such as genetic tests, must comply with more stringent requirements than laboratories performing moderate or waived testing.\nAs a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, if the laboratory is accredited, a CMS-approved accreditation organization.\nCLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. In some cases, state licensure programs actually substitute for the federal CLIA program. In other instances, the state\u2019s regulations may be in addition to the CLIA requirements. In addition, our laboratory holds multiple state licenses to the extent that we accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations.\nWe may become aware from time to time of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure to accept specimens from the state, and other states may impose such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements, or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow all instructions from the state regulators regarding compliance with such requirements.\nLaboratories must renew certification every two years, which typically includes an inspection of the laboratory. Our laboratory was most recently inspected in September 2015 and no deficiencies or other issues were noted and our CLIA license was renewed.\nFood and Drug Administration\nAlthough the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, that are validated by the developing laboratory and performed only by that laboratory, it has generally exercised enforcement discretion in not otherwise regulating most tests developed and performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.\nIn July 2010, FDA held a public meeting in which FDA officials including those from the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Products (OIR), within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) announced their intention to develop a regulatory framework for LDTs that would be based on the risks posed by such tests. In particular, FDA officials stated that laboratory developed tests offered directly to consumers would no longer be subject to enforcement discretion. Concomitant with that meeting, FDA sent letters to more than a dozen companies offering direct-to-consumer, or DTC, genetic tests, including us, stating that their tests appeared to be subject to regulation as medical devices and requesting information on how the companies planned to come into compliance with FDA requirements. The FDA letter inquired about our Inherent Health brand of DTC genetic tests and stated that these tests appeared to meet the definition of a \u201cdevice\u201d under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. The letter requested that the Company provide FDA with the clearance or approval number for the tests or with the basis for determination that the tests do not require FDA clearance or approval. In the letter, FDA offered to meet with us, \u201cto discuss whether there are tests you are promoting that do not require review by FDA and what information you would need to submit in order for your products to be legally marketed.\u201d\nIn March 2011, FDA convened an expert advisory panel to discuss and make recommendations on scientific issues concerning DTC genetic tests that make medical claims. The panel expressed a variety of concerns regarding DTC genetic testing and recommended that certain tests not be permitted to be sold DTC. We submitted a position paper to the FDA in advance of the meeting and presented testimony to the panel at a public meeting on March 8, 2011. After that meeting, the OIR director publicly stated that FDA would likely take a case-by-case approach with respect to which types of genetic tests may be offered DTC. He also stated that OIR planned to issue three guidance documents addressing oversight of laboratory-developed tests. However, he did not provide a timeframe for OIR\u2019s release of these documents. In March 2012, an FDA spokesperson stated that FDA\u2019s plan to adjust its enforcement discretion policy for LDT\u2019s is currently under \u201cadministrative review.\u201d\nOn July 31, 2014 the FDA provided 60-day notice to Congress of its plan to issue draft guidance on the regulation of laboratory developed tests. On September 30, 2014, the FDA posted two draft guidances on its website, followed by notice in the Federal Register on October 3, 2014 announcing their release and the opening of a 120-day public comment period. This comment period lasted until February 2, 2015. FDA has not to date issued final versions of either of these guidance documents. In a footnote to one of these draft guidance documents, FDA stated that laboratory tests offered directly to consumers were not considered LDTs and would not be subject to FDA enforcement discretion.\nThe FDA issued a Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administrative Staff on In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices on July 14, 2011, which, if finalized, is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostics and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defined an in vitro companion diagnostic device, or IVD Companion Diagnostic Device, as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. This definition is much narrower than the commonly used term \u201ccompanion diagnostic,\u201d which refers generally to tests that may be useful, but are not necessarily a determining factor in the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product. The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD Companion Diagnostic Device in its therapeutic product development plan. The sponsor of the therapeutic product can decide to develop its own IVD Companion Diagnostic Device, partner with a diagnostic device sponsor to develop the appropriate IVD Companion Diagnostic Device, or explore modification of an existing IVD diagnostic device (its own or another sponsor\u2019s) to accommodate the appropriate intended use. The FDA has approved a number of drug/diagnostic device companions in accordance with the Draft Guidance. However, this guidance will not apply to the LDTs that are used as companion diagnostics that merely provide useful information and are not linked to a specific drug indication.\nOn November 1, 2010, we met with the director and staff members of the OIR to present information on our tests. At FDA\u2019s request, we submitted a plan for how our tests would be submitted to FDA in December 2010 and requested a follow-up meeting to obtain feedback on the plan from OIR personnel. We did not receive any substantive feedback on this plan from FDA.\nIn October and November 2015 the FDA sent a number of \u201cUntitled Letters\u201d to entities marketing genetic tests directly to consumers, including to us. Specifically, on November 2, we received an Untitled Letter from the FDA requesting information about whether certain specified tests had obtained FDA clearance. We submitted a written reply to this letter on December 16, 2015, in which we responded that (1) we do not currently offer an osteoarthritis test; (2) that the ILUSTRA Test is a LDT subject to FDA \u201cenforcement discretion; and (3) that the Weight Management Genetic test is not a medical device subject to FDA\u2019s statutory jurisdiction or, if it is, should be subject to enforcement discretion because it is a low-risk wellness product. We requested a meeting with OIR to discuss the Inherent Health tests.\nOn February 3, 2016 we met with the director and staff members of OIR to further discuss our letter response. The FDA issued minutes of the meeting on February 16, 2016, which confirmed that we do not offer an Osteoarthritis test and that the ILUSTRA Test is currently offered only as an LDT and is therefore currently subject to FDA enforcement discretion. In addition, they confirmed their interest in obtaining further information on how we would come into compliance with respect to the Inherent Health tests, since those tests are offered DTC and therefore are not subject to FDA enforcement discretion. We are continuing to engage with OIR regarding the appropriate next steps for these tests.\nOn April 5, 2016, we announced the results of discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) in response to an Untitled Letter issued by the FDA on November 4, 2015 and a meeting on February 3, 2016 with personnel within FDA\u2019s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health (OIR) to discuss Interleukin\u2019s written response to OIR with respect to the Untitled Letter. OIR personnel confirmed that the ILUSTRA Test is a laboratory developed test (LDT) currently subject to FDA enforcement discretion and may continue to be marketed without prior marketing authorization at this time. Our Bone Health and Heart Health tests, which are part of the Inherent Health line of tests, will be transitioned from a direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution channel to a distribution model under which a licensed healthcare provider orders tests and oversees any resulting change in care. These two tests were available through Interleukin Genetics\u2019 DTC retail channels until May 22, 2016, at which time they were no longer available unless requested by an authorized healthcare provider.\nHIPAA and Other Privacy Laws\nThe Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) established for the first time comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, significantly expanded the scope of HIPAA and increased penalties for violating HIPAA. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations (\u201cCovered Entities\u201d): health plans, health care clearing houses, and health care providers who conduct certain health care transactions electronically. They also apply to vendors of Covered Entities called \u201cBusiness Associates\u201d that access protected health information to provide services to or perform functions on behalf of Covered Entities. Covered Entities and Business Associates must have in place administrative, physical and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. We are not currently a Covered Entity subject to the HIPAA privacy and security standard. It is possible that in the future we will become a Covered Entity (for example if any of the tests that we perform become reimbursable by insurers). Regardless of our own Covered Entity status, HIPAA may apply to our customers, such as health care providers and health plans. Even though we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to penalties, lawsuits and experience other adverse consequences if we wrongfully acquire protected health information, aid and abet a HIPAA violation by a customer or if we obtain or disclose protected health information maintained by a Covered Entity without authorization in violation of HIPAA. In addition, some lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, have been pursued at the state level against both covered entities and entities that are not directly subject to HIPAA for breach of confidentiality and security violations.\nOur activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, including state data security laws that apply to personal data of our employees as well as our customers. \u201cPersonal data\u201d includes information such as name coupled with social security number, state issued identification number, or financial account number. State data security laws impose specific security measures for the protection of personal data and require notification to affected individuals and government authorities in the event of breach. Non-compliance may result in government investigations, fines and significant negative publicity for our company.\nMany states protect health information with confidentiality laws that are more stringent than HIPAA and that are not preempted by HIPAA. Most states protect certain categories of sensitive health information, such as infectious disease status or behavioral health history. Genetic information, including genetic test results, is often a protected category of health information. We must comply with all of these state-imposed laws. There are also international privacy laws, such as the European Data Directive, that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information and personal data across national lines.\nIn addition to health care privacy and data security laws, many states have adopted laws governing genetic testing and the use and disclosure of genetic test results. These laws typically require a specific form of written consent in advance of genetic testing and require special protections for test results. Given the complexity of genetic testing and the variety of techniques available for evaluating similar clinical conditions, these laws can be difficult to apply, making compliance more complex and potentially delaying implementation of a testing program when parties disagree on interpretation. Our failure to comply with these laws may result in fines, government enforcement, privacy litigation and adverse publicity for our company.\nIf we become subject to HIPAA or other state or federal privacy and security laws, we will have to establish and maintain an active compliance program. We will be subject to audit and investigation and may also be audited in connection with a complaint. We would also be subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We would also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nGINA Legislation\nIn 2008, the Congress passed and the President signed into law, the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act or GINA. GINA prohibits certain entities from discriminating using genetic information, which includes information from genetic tests, genetic tests of family members and family medical history. It also includes information about an individual\u2019s or family member\u2019s request for or receipt of genetic services. This law generally prohibits health insurers or health benefit plans from:\n\u00b7 increasing the group premium or contribution amounts (such as co-payments) based on genetic information;\n\u00b7 requesting or requiring an individual or family member to undergo a genetic test; or\n\u00b7 requesting, requiring or purchasing genetic information prior to or in connection with enrollment, or at any time for underwriting purposes.\nThe law also prohibits employers and certain other entities, including employment agencies, from using genetic information in employment decision-making and from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information. It also strictly limits such entities from disclosing genetic information.\nIn October 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule to modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement Title I of GINA. Final regulations were adopted in January, 2013. Among other things, this rule revises the definition of health information under HIPAA to include genetic information.\nGINA applies to some of our customers and to us as an employer. We could be subject to penalties, lawsuits or experience other adverse consequences if our operations violate GINA or cause another entity to violate GINA.\nFederal Trade Commission\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over the advertisements of many types of products, including most medical devices, and prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices. Advertising for our tests, including statements made on our website, is subject to FTC requirements. In recent years, the FTC instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement companies for false and misleading marketing practices and advertising of certain products, including those intended for weight loss. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and monetary payments by the companies involved. Although the FTC has never threatened an enforcement action against us for the advertising of our products, there can be no assurance that the FTC will not question the advertising for our products in the future.\nOther Information\nOur executive offices are located at 135 Beaver Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02452, and our telephone number is (781) 398-0700.

Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nIf we fail to obtain additional capital or enter into a collaboration or strategic transaction by the second quarter of 2017, we may have to end our operations and seek protection under bankruptcy laws.\nWe expect that our current and anticipated financial resources will be adequate to maintain our current and planned operations through the second quarter of 2017. We need significant additional capital to fund our continued operations, including to capitalize on the opportunity in CVD testing, for the commercialization efforts for our ILUSTRA Program, continued research and development efforts, obtaining and protecting patents and administrative expenses. We are actively seeking additional funding, however, based on current economic conditions, additional financing may not be available, or, if available, it may not be available on favorable terms. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our existing shareholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our then-existing shareholders will result. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, tests or products in development. We have also been considering potential strategic alternatives. Such strategic alternatives include, but are not limited to, a sale of the company, a business combination or collaboration, and an orderly liquidation of the company. We do not know if we will be successful in pursuing any strategic alternative or that any transaction will occur. If we cannot obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or enter into a strategic transaction, we may have to discontinue operations and seek protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws.\nThere is substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertain realization. We expect to incur additional losses in 2017 and beyond and, accordingly, we are dependent on financings and potential revenue to fund our operations, to advance interest in our CVD program and support the market adoption of the ILUSTRA Program. The timing of any revenues that we may receive from the ILUSTRA Program is uncertain at this time, and is contingent upon a number of factors, including our ability to attract employer and insurance carriers as customers directly, to consummate arrangements with additional partners to promote the ILUSTRA Program, our partners\u2019 ability to attract customers for the ILUSTRA Program, and the timing of utilization of the ILUSTRA Program by customers, among other possible variables. We cannot assure you that we will ever receive substantial revenues from the ILUSTRA Program. We expect that our current cash will be sufficient to support our operations only through the second quarter of 2017.\nOur ability to realize the carrying value of our fixed assets and intangible assets is especially dependent on management\u2019s ability to successfully execute on its plan. We need to generate additional funds in order to meet our financial obligations. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, we may not be able to realize the carrying value of its fixed assets and intangible assets.\nThe timing and amount of revenues, if any, that we may receive pursuant to any existing or future agreement we may enter into with insurance carriers or large employers is uncertain.\nThe timing of any revenues that we may receive under any agreement we have or may enter into with an insurance carrier, large employer or other customer is very uncertain at this time and is dependent on a number of variables that are or may be beyond our control. We continue to engage in discussions for the use of our technology for CVD testing and the ILUSTRA Program with insurance companies and large employers who might ultimately adopt enhanced benefits designs or employer-sponsored wellness initiatives that incorporate the ILUSTRA Test, or utilize the ILUSTRA Program through other arrangements, through the use of consultants, channel partners and our internal management team. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully enter into any such agreements or arrangements, or that if entered into, such agreements or arrangements will provide significant revenue. The failure to enter into any agreement with other insurance carriers or large employers and to receive significant revenues under any such agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect these losses to continue in the future.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses since our inception and expect these losses to continue for some time. We incurred losses from operations of $7.3 million in 2015 and $6.7 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $136.4 million. Our losses result primarily from research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets. Although we generate revenues from sales of our genetic risk assessment tests, this may not be sufficient to result in net income in the foreseeable future. We will need to generate significant revenue to continue our research and development programs and achieve profitability. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will achieve profitability.\nThe market for personalized health generally and genetic risk assessment tests in particular is unproven.\nThe markets and customer base in the field of personalized health are not well established. Adoption of technologies in this emerging field requires substantial market development and there can be no assurance that channels for marketing our products can or will be successfully developed by us or others. As a result, there can be no assurance that our products will be successfully commercialized or that they can be sold at sufficient volumes to make them profitable. If our potential customers do not accept our products, or take a longer time to accept them than we anticipate, it will reduce our anticipated sales and materially harm our business.\nThe market for genetic risk assessment tests, as part of the field of personalized health, is at an early stage of development and may not continue to grow. The scientific community, including us, has only a limited understanding of the role of genes in predicting disease. The success of our genetic risk assessment tests will depend upon their acceptance as being useful and cost-effective to the customers who purchase these products, the physicians and other members of the medical community who recommend or prescribe them, as well as third-party payers, such as insurance companies and the government. We can only achieve broad market acceptance with substantial education about the benefits and limitations of genetic risk assessment tests while providing the tests at a fair cost. We expect to expend significant funds and resources to educate patients, dentists and other providers, and payers on the benefits of our ILUSTRA Program. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Furthermore, while positive media attention resulting from new scientific studies or announcements can spur rapid growth in individual segments of the market, and also impact individual brands, news that challenges individual segments or products can have a negative impact on the industry overall as well as on sales of the challenged segments or products. The marketplace may never accept our products, and we may never be able to successfully commercialize our products, including the ILUSTRA Program.\nWe could become subject to intense competition from other companies, which may damage our business.\nThe field of personalized health is highly competitive. Our potential competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, consumer products companies, specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Furthermore, many of these competitors are more experienced than we are in discovering, commercializing and marketing products. These greater resources may allow our competitors to discover important genes or genetic markers and more quickly and effectively develop and commercialize genetic tests than we or our partners are able to do. If we are not able to successfully market genetic tests, either alone or through collaborations, our business will be materially harmed. We expect competition to intensify in our industry as technical advances are made and become more widely known.\nEthical, legal and social issues related to genetic testing may reduce demand for our products.\nGenetic testing has raised concerns regarding the appropriate utilization and the confidentiality of information provided by genetic testing. Genetic tests for assessing a person\u2019s likelihood of developing a chronic disease have focused public attention on the need to protect the privacy of genetic information. For example, concerns have been expressed that insurance carriers and employers may use these tests to discriminate on the basis of genetic information, resulting in barriers to the acceptance of genetic tests by consumers. This could lead to governmental authorities prohibiting genetic testing or calling for limits on or regulating the use of genetic testing, particularly for diseases for which there is no known cure. Any of these scenarios could decrease demand for our products.\nTechnological changes may cause our tests to become obsolete.\nWe have to date focused our efforts on genetic tests based on a small number of candidate genes and genetic variants. It is now possible to use array technology to conduct whole genome association studies for risk assessment, which may make our technologies obsolete. In order to develop customers and markets for our genetic risk assessment tests, we may be required to invest substantial additional capital and other resources.\nWe have limited experience and capabilities with respect to distributing, marketing and selling genetic tests on our own and will continue to depend substantially on third parties to commercialize our tests.\nWe have limited experience and capabilities with respect to distributing, marketing and selling genetic risk assessment tests on our own. In June 2009, we announced the launch of our new Inherent Health brand of genetic tests. On October 26, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Amway Global, an affiliate of Alticor, pursuant to which it sells our Inherent Health brand of genetics tests through its e-commerce Web site via a hyperlink to our e-commerce site. In 2016 and 2015, revenues from this agreement accounted for 24% and 45% of our revenues, respectively. In addition, beginning in September 2012 and again in 2013, Access Business Group LLC, an affiliate of Alticor, placed purchase orders totaling approximately $3.3 million consisting of weight management kits. The kits are included as part of a promotional bundle of products that Amway sold to their Individual Business Owners. In 2016 and 2015, revenues from this arrangement accounted for 4% and 13% of our revenues, respectively. We continue to engage in discussions with potential partners for the use of our IL-1 technology for CVD testing and with insurance companies and large employers for the use of our ILUSTRA Program, through the use of consultants, channel partners and our internal management team. We have, to date, had very limited success in marketing and selling our genetic tests, including the CVD and ILUSTRA Tests, and we can provide no assurance that our current or planned commercialization efforts will be successful.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing additional strategic alliances, our ability to develop and market products and services may be damaged.\nEntering into additional strategic alliances for the development and commercialization of products and services based on our discoveries is an important element of our business strategy. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. If we fail to maintain our existing alliances or to establish additional alliances or other alternative arrangements, then our ability to develop and market products and services will be damaged. In addition, the terms of any future strategic alliances may be unfavorable to us or these strategic alliances may be unsuccessful.\nBecause our products are based on emerging science, if we make changes to our tests based on new scientific findings, market acceptance of our products may decrease and we may be exposed to liability in excess of our product liability insurance coverage.\nOur genetic test products are based on emerging science, and we continue to conduct studies to further enhance the usefulness and scientific credibility of our products. If we make changes to our tests based on new data, it could harm our credibility, decrease market acceptance of our products or expose us to liability claims. We currently maintain product liability insurance, but it is often difficult to obtain, is expensive and may not be available in the future on economically acceptable terms. In addition, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy. We may become subject to product liability claims that, even if they are without merit, could result in significant legal defense costs to us. If we are held liable for claims for which we are not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, those claims could materially damage our business and our financial condition. Any product liability claim against us or resulting recall of our products could create significant negative publicity.\nCurrent economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption including, among other things, extreme volatility in prices of publicly traded securities, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. We believe current economic conditions and financial market turmoil could adversely affect our operations. Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions may cause consumers to reign in their spending generally, the impact of which may be that they stop or delay their purchases of our genetic tests and consumer products. If these circumstances persist or continue to worsen, our future operating results could be adversely affected, particularly relative to our current expectations.\nOur dependence on key executives and scientists could adversely impact the development and management of our business.\nOur success depends on the ability, experience and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. If we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key employees, it could damage our business. In addition, our success depends on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial and scientific personnel. The pool of personnel with the skill that we require is limited. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense. We compete with numerous pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research organizations in the highly competitive Boston, Massachusetts business area. Our current senior management team is employed by us under agreements that may be terminated by them for any reason upon adequate notice. There can be no assurances, therefore, that we will be able to retain our senior executives or replace them, if necessary. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our personnel.\nIf Pyxis or any of its affiliates enters a business in competition with ours, certain of our directors might have a conflict of interest.\nWe have entered into an agreement with our stockholder, Pyxis (collectively, with its affiliates, the \u201cInterested Parties\u201d), allocating corporate opportunities as permitted under Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This agreement regulates and defines the conduct of certain of our affairs as they may involve the Interested Parties, and our powers, rights, duties and liabilities and those of our officers and directors in connection with corporate opportunities. Except under certain circumstances, the Interested Parties have the right to engage in the same or similar activities or lines of business or have an interest in the same classes or categories of corporate opportunities as we do. If any Interested Parties or one of our directors appointed by an Interested Party acquire knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Interested Party and us, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Interested Party will not have a duty to inform us about the corporate opportunity. In addition, the Interested Party will not be liable to us or to other stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder of ours for not informing us of the corporate opportunity, keeping it for its own account, or referring it to another person. Additionally, except under limited circumstances, if an officer or employee of an Interested Party who is also one of our directors is offered a corporate opportunity, such opportunity shall not belong to us. In addition, we agreed that such director will have satisfied his duties to us and not be liable to us or to you in connection with such opportunity.\nWe may be prohibited from fully using our net operating loss carryforwards, which could affect our financial performance.\nAs a result of the losses incurred since inception, we have not recorded a federal income tax provision and have recorded a valuation allowance against all future tax benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2016, we had gross net operating loss (NOL) and research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $94.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively for federal income tax purposes, and of approximately $17.6 million and $1.1 million for state income tax purposes, expiring in varying amounts through the year 2036. Our ability to use these NOLs and credit carryforwards is subject to restrictions contained in the Internal Revenue Code which provide for limitations on our utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards following a greater than 50% ownership change during the prescribed testing period. On March 5, 2003, we had such a change. As a result, all of our NOL carryforwards as of that date are limited as to utilization. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain of the carryforwards prior to utilization. In addition, our equity offerings, including those in 2013, 2014 and 2016 may have resulted in qualifying changes in ownership. A formal study, which we have not undertaken, is required to determine applicability of restrictions and might indicate that our NOL carryforwards are subject to additional limitations on utilization. In addition, in order to realize the future tax benefits of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, we must generate taxable income, of which there is no assurance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to obtain patent protection for our products and preserve our trade secrets, then competitors may develop competing products and services, which will likely decrease our sales and market share.\nOur success will depend on our ability to obtain patent protection in the United States and in other countries for our products and services. In addition, our success will also depend upon our ability to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. We own rights to 9 issued U.S. patents and have a number of additional U.S. patent applications pending. We have also been granted a number of corresponding foreign patents and have a number of foreign counterparts of our U.S. patents and patent applications pending. Our patent positions, and those of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our ability to develop and commercialize products and services depends on our ability to:\n\u00b7 obtain patents;\n\u00b7 obtain licenses to the proprietary rights of others;\n\u00b7 prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights; and\n\u00b7 protect trade secrets.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and any issued patents may never afford meaningful protection for our technology or products or provide us with a competitive advantage. Further, others may develop competing products, which avoid legally infringing upon, or conflicting with, our patents. There is no assurance that another company will not replicate one or more of our products, and this may harm our ability to do business. In addition, competitors may challenge any patents issued to us, and these patents may subsequently be narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. There have been several cases involving \u201cgene patents\u201d and diagnostic claims that have been considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. A suit brought by multiple plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, against Myriad Genetics, or Myriad, and the USPTO, could impact biotechnology and diagnostic patents. That case involves certain of Myriad\u2019s U.S. patents related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Federal Circuit issued a written decision on July 29, 2011 that reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that Myriad\u2019s composition claims to \u201cisolated\u201d DNA molecules cover unpatentable subject matter. The Federal Circuit court instead held that the breast cancer genes are patentable subject matter. Subsequently, on March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories, or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to add enough inventive content to the underlying correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in the Myriad case, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for further consideration in light of their decision in the Prometheus case. The Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on July 20, 2012, and issued a decision on August 16, 2012. The Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier decision and held that composition of matter claims directed to isolated nucleic acids are patent-eligible subject matter, but that method claims consisting of only abstract mental processes are not patent-eligible. On September 25, 2012, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision with respect to the composition of matter claims. On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court granted the petition and agreed to review the case. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the Myriad case. According to the decision, claims directed to genomic DNA cover unpatentable subject matter. However, claims directed to cDNA are patent eligible subject matter.\nOn March 4, 2014, the USPTO issued a memorandum to patent examiners providing guidelines for examining process claims for patent eligibility in view of the Supreme Court decision in Prometheus. On December 16, 2014 an interim guidance was issued that supersedes the March 4, 2014 memorandum but essentially followed the same direction for patent eligibility. The guidance indicates that claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea that do not meet the eligibility requirements should be rejected as non-statutory subject matter. We cannot assure you that the decision described above, rulings in other cases or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO will not negatively impact our patent portfolio.\nCongress directed the USPTO to study effective ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gene patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic diagnostic tests exist. This study will examine the impact that independent second opinion testing has on providing medical care to patients; the effect that providing independent second opinion genetic diagnostic testing would have on the existing patent and license holders of an exclusive genetic test; the impact of current practices on testing results and performance; and the role of insurance coverage on the provision of genetic diagnostic tests. The USPTO was directed to report the findings of the study to Congress and provide recommendations for establishing the availability of independent confirming genetic diagnostic test activity by June 16, 2012. On August 28, 2012, the Department of Commerce sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee leadership updating them on the status of the genetic testing report. The letter stated in part: \u201cGiven the complexity and diversity of the opinions, comments, and suggestions provided by interested parties, and the important policy considerations involved, we believe that further review, discussion, and analysis are required before a final report can be submitted to Congress.\u201d The USPTO issued a Request for Comments and Notice of Public Hearing on Genetic Diagnostic Testing on January 25, 2012, and held additional public hearings in February and March 2013. It is unclear whether the results of this study will be acted upon by the USPTO or result in Congressional efforts to change the law or process in a manner that could negatively impact our present or future patent portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in either the Myriad or Prometheus case will not have a negative impact gene or diagnostic patents generally or the ability of biotechnology and diagnostic companies to obtain or enforce their patents in the future. Such negative decisions by the Supreme Court could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, with confidentiality agreements. The third parties we contract with may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. If they do not protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. We also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Our competitors may discover or independently develop our trade secrets.\nThird parties may own or control patents or patent applications and require us to seek licenses, which could increase our costs or prevent us from developing or marketing our products or services.\nWe may not have rights under patents or patent applications that are related to our current or proposed products. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. Therefore, in some cases, to develop or sell any proposed products or services with patent rights controlled by third parties, our collaborators or ourselves may seek, or may be required to seek, licenses under third-party patents and patent applications. If this occurs, we may have to pay license fees, royalties or both, to the licensor. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, our collaborators or we may be prohibited from developing or selling our products or services.\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Tests\nAny tests that may be developed by us may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval, which can be lengthy, costly and burdensome.\nOur currently marketed tests were launched as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, performed in our CLIA-certified clinical laboratory operating in Waltham, Massachusetts. We expect that our future LDTs will also be performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. Although FDA believes that tests such as ours fall within its jurisdiction as medical devices, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs, meaning that such tests generally have not been subject to FDA regulatory requirements. However, the Agency\u2019s regulatory approach to LDTs is uncertain, and whether or when FDA will issue final guidance documents implementing the agency\u2019s proposed regulatory framework is unclear. It is also unclear how a final regulatory framework will affect our current and future tests, as the level of regulation will depend on FDA\u2019s evaluation of the risk posed by the specific test. With respect to our LDTs that are not offered DTC, such as the ILUSTRA Test, if FDA issues final guidance implementing a risk-based regulatory framework for LDTs, we intend to comply fully and acknowledge that non-compliance may result in enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to market and sell our tests and may harm our reputation. We are uncertain as to what, if any, regulatory requirements may apply to our tests in the future. We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review or approval, will not be required in the future.\nWith respect to our Inherent Health tests, which have historically been offered DTC, we have been working with the FDA to address concerns and bring our tests into compliance for DTC. At this time two of our tests are still offered DTC, Weight Management and Nutritional Needs and we are in the midst of finalizing changes in marketing materials required for these tests. We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review or approval, will not be required for these tests in the future.\nIf the FDA requires us to obtain clearance through its 510k premarket notification process or obtain approval through its premarket approval, or PMA process, either as a condition of continuing to market our tests or bringing future tests to market, our business could be negatively impacted. Requiring FDA clearance or approval could be lengthy, costly and burdensome. In addition, depending upon the FDA\u2019s response to a submission we may be required to stop selling our tests, revise our tests significantly, or delay introduction of new tests. Additionally, if our tests become subject to more active regulation as medical devices by the FDA, we would be required to comply with requirements including establishment registration, device listing, adverse event reporting, and good manufacturing practices. We would also be subject to penalties, including seizure and injunction, for noncompliance with FDA requirements. Complying with FDA requirements could add additional costs and burdens to our operations.\nWe are subject to government regulation which may significantly increase our costs and delay introduction of our products.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal and state legal requirements including CLIA, the FD&C Act, state clinical laboratory licensure laws and implementing regulations. The growth of our business may increase the potential of being found in violation of these laws. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that the technologies at issue are new and the applicability of statutory and regulatory provisions to these technologies has not been fully developed, implemented, or subjected to judicial review, and the statutory and regulatory provisions themselves are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us, or any business partners, for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we or they successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If their or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, they or we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, and they or we could be required to curtail or cease operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nIf we do not comply with governmental regulations applicable to our CLIA-certified laboratory, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe establishment and operation of our laboratory is subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States. The laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of compliance and is licensed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and other states as required, which enables us to provide testing services to residents of all states. Failure to comply with state regulations or changes in state regulatory requirements, could result in a substantial curtailment or even prohibition of the operations of our laboratory and could have a material adverse effect on our business. CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. To renew CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of these laboratories. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or our state licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to continue our testing operations which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTests based on our technology may require clinical trial testing, which can be lengthy, costly and burdensome.\nIf the FDA decides to require pre-market clearance or approval of LDT\u2019s, we may be required to perform clinical trials prior to submitting a marketing application. If we are required to conduct clinical trials, whether using prospectively acquired tissue samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase development costs and delay commercialization. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population and the nature of the disease or condition being studied.\nFuture therapeutic collaborators, if any, may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of any therapeutic product that they may develop.\nIf, in the future, we enter into any collaborations relating to the use of our technology in the development of therapeutic products, any therapeutic products that our collaborators may develop will be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new therapeutic product can be sold. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals for therapeutic products is unpredictable but typically exceeds several years. It is possible that none of the therapeutic products our collaborators may develop will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them. In addition, if the use of any test that we develop is necessary for the safe use of a collaborator\u2019s therapeutic product, we might be required to obtain clearance or approval of our test.\nFurthermore, any regulatory approval to market a therapeutic product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the therapeutic product. Any therapeutic product that our collaborators may develop will also be subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, approval by the FDA of a therapeutic product does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States or vice versa.\nIf we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to market and sell our tests and may harm our reputation.\nIf we in the future fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect the ability to successfully develop, market and sell our tests and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of such tests or products by the market. These enforcement actions could include:\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 recalls, public notification or medical device safety alerts;\n\u00b7 restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing such tests or products;\n\u00b7 product seizures;\n\u00b7 injunctions;\n\u00b7 civil penalties, including monetary fines; and\n\u00b7 criminal penalties.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development activities involve the use of hazardous and chemicals materials, and we maintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities. We believe our procedures for storing, handling and disposing these materials in our facilities comply with the relevant local and Federal guidelines. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nChanges in healthcare policy could impact commercialization of our tests.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, became law. This law substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA contains a number of provisions that may impact our business and operations in ways we cannot currently predict. In particular, we believe that the ACA may impact adoption of Reimbursed Dental Plans and other reimbursed insurance plans that include our ILUSTRA Test because there is uncertainty in the cost of compliance with the ACA and how that may impact employer coverage for adult dental care in their overall benefits plan.\nIn addition to the ACA, there will likely continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the ACA or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is listed on the OTCQB\u00ae, which could result in a limited market for our common stock.\nOur common stock was listed on the NYSE Amex until August 16, 2010, when it was suspended for failure to comply with the NYSE Amex continued listing standards. Our common stock then began trading on the OTCQB\u00ae under the symbol ILIU. This delisting could hurt our investors by reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock. Additionally, the delisting could negatively affect us by reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively affect our ability to raise capital.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may drop.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2016, our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $0.01 to a high of $0.46. The volatility of stocks for companies in our industry often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into a partnership or partnerships for the CVD test;\n\u00b7 the commercial success of the ILUSTRA Program;\n\u00b7 demand for and acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop new relationships and maintain and enhance existing relationships with strategic partners;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 introduction of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 failure to secure adequate capital to fund our operations, or the issuance of equity securities at prices below fair market price;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any cover our common stock;\n\u00b7 litigation;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 general market conditions;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u00b7 overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nMembers or our Board of Directors and their affiliates and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of April 13, 2017, our executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 46.5% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management and/or the board of directors, delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and you should not expect to receive any funds without selling your shares of common stock, which you may only be able to do at a loss.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently prohibited by the terms of the Loan Agreement with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation, and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Therefore, you should not expect to receive any funds without selling your shares, which you may only be able to do at a loss.", "PERMNO": 85564, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ILIU"}
