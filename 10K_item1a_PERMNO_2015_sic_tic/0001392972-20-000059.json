{"cik": "1392972", "company": "PROS Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock; these risks are not necessarily listed in terms of their importance or level of risk.\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may limit or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the storage, and to a more limited extent, the transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, including personal and other sensitive data. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur significant costs to maintain security measures designed to prevent, eliminate or alleviate security vulnerabilities, data theft, computer viruses, malicious software programs, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems (each a \"Security Incident\"), and obtain third-party security attestations regarding those security measures. Despite the implementation of these security measures and third-party security attestations, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or misconduct or otherwise, we could experience a Security Incident that could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to compromise systems change frequently, may exploit vulnerabilities in third party systems or software which we interoperate with, and may not be recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact of these problems on us. Any Security Incident could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, as well as loss of confidence in the security of our solutions and services, damage to our reputation, negative impact to our future sales, disruption of our business, increases to our information security costs, and could lead to indemnity obligations, legal liability and other costs. In the normal course of our business, we experience Security Incidents. To date, however, the identified Security Incidents have neither been material or significant to us, including to our business operations, nor had a material financial impact. There can be no assurance that future Security Incidents will not be material or significant.\nFailure to sustain our historical renewal rates and pricing could adversely affect our future revenue and operating results.\nOur subscription agreements are typically for an initial term of three years, and our legacy maintenance and support agreements are typically renewed for annual terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their software subscriptions after the expiration of their initial term, and some customers elect not to renew. Subscription revenue represented the majority of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Historically, maintenance and support revenue represented a more significant portion of our total revenue. As a percentage of total revenue, maintenance and support revenue for our legacy on-premises software products has been declining as it represented approximately 23%, 33% and 41% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe may not accurately predict future customer renewal rates, which can decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, mergers and acquisitions of our customers, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers choose not to renew their subscription, maintenance and support agreements with us on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny downturn in sales to our target markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to sell our software solutions to customers in our target industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. If we are unable to sell our software solutions effectively to customers in these industries, we may not be able to grow our business. It is uncertain whether our software solutions may achieve and sustain the levels of market demand that we anticipate. Such uncertainty is attributable to, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to implement our software solutions in certain sub-verticals within our target industries;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to increase our customer base in our target industries; and\n\u2022\nour experience implementing our software solutions in certain sub-verticals may be limited within our target industries.\nOur revenue growth has historically been derived from customers in many major industries. Our revenue growth is highly dependent upon continued growth of market demand in these industries, and there can be no assurance our solutions may achieve or sustain widespread acceptance among customers in these industries. Failure to expand market acceptance of our solutions or maintain sales in these industries could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our software solutions require implementation projects that are subject to significant risks and delays, which if any occurred could negatively impact the effectiveness of our software, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe implementation of certain of our software solutions involve complex, large-scale projects that require substantial support operations, significant resources and reliance on factors that are beyond our control. For example, the success of certain of our implementation projects is dependent upon the quality of data used by our software solutions and the commitment of customers\u2019 resources and personnel to the projects. We may not be able to correct or compensate for weaknesses or problems in data, or any lack of our customers\u2019 commitment and investment in personnel and resources.\nFurther, various factors, including our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in customer requirements, delays, or deviation from recommended best practices may occur during an implementation project. As a result, we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of our products. If we are unable to successfully manage the implementation of our software solutions, and as a result those products or implementations do not meet customer needs or expectations, we may become involved in disputes with our customers, may be unable to sell additional products, or unable to secure a renewal of the customer\u2019s subscription and our business reputation and financial performance may be significantly harmed. If an implementation project for a large customer or a number of customers is substantially delayed or canceled, our ability to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality to enhance our existing software solutions, we may not be able to grow our business and it could be harmed.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments, newly emerging and changing customer requirements, and frequent solution introductions, updates and functional enhancements. We must introduce enhancements to our existing software solutions in order to meet our business plan, maintain or improve our competitive position, keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and increase awareness of software for selling improvement, including configure-price-quote, pricing and airline eCommerce, including shopping, merchandising and retail. New functionality we develop may not be introduced timely and may not achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate material revenue. Furthermore, our competitors could be heavily investing in research and development, and may develop and market new solutions that may compete with, and may reduce the demand for, our software solutions. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in developing or otherwise acquiring, marketing and selling new functionality, or delivering updates and upgrades that meet changing industry standards and customer demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, marketing and selling of such functionality. If we are unable to develop or acquire new functionality, enhance our existing software solutions or adapt to changing industry requirements to meet market demand, we may not be able to grow our business and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, because our software solutions are intended to interoperate with a variety of third party front and back office software solutions, we must continue to modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such solutions. Any inability of our software to operate effectively with third party software necessary to provide effective solutions to our customers, could reduce the demand for our software solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and limit our revenue.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed. We invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel; however, as we continue to scale our business both organically and through potential acquisitions,\nit may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic objectives.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced, and are continuing to experience, substantial growth in our customers, headcount and operations. We expect to continue to expand our customer base, headcount and operations in the near term. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, general and administrative resources and operational infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage this growth and scale our operations. To manage this growth, we have and will continue to need to improve our operational, financial, management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we continue to grow, we also need to ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees, and that we continue to appropriately manage our assets. Failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.\nWe depend on third-party data centers, software, data and other unrelated service providers and any disruption from such third party providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business.\nOur cloud products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, including Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer and Amazon Web Services, all of which must inter-operate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We utilize third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud platform providers, and other service providers to host and deliver our subscription services as well as for our own business operations. We host our cloud products from data centers in a variety of countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates and Australia. While we control and generally have exclusive access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to Security Incidents, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite our failover capabilities, standard protocols and other precautions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, these providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nCertain of our applications are essential to our customers\u2019 ability to quote, price, and/or sell their products and services. Any interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy or timeliness of quotes, pricing or other information and as a result could require us to issue service credits to our customers, damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our solutions, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, certain of our applications require access to our customer\u2019s data which may be held by third parties, some of whom are, or may become, our competitors. For example, many of our travel industry products rely upon access to airline data held by large airline IT providers which compete against certain of our travel products. Certain of these competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, make it difficult for our airline customers to access their data in a timely and/or cost-effective manner.\nAny disruption from our third-party data center, software, data or other service providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business and could damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales and lead to legal liability and other costs.\nEvolving data privacy, cyber security and data localization laws and regulations impact our business and expose us to increased liability.\nPersonal privacy, data localization and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in many other jurisdictions. We provide our cloud software solutions globally, including in countries that have, or may adopt in the future, stringent laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cyber security and data localization. The worldwide regulatory framework for these issues continues to rapidly evolve. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes substantial requirements regarding the handling of personal data and provides for robust regulatory enforcement and sanctions for non-compliance. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) provides new data privacy rights for consumers which creates new and uncertain operational requirements for our business. These and similar laws, as well\nas other data privacy, cyber security and data localization laws and regulations, are inconsistent across jurisdictions, may be subject to interpretation and future changes and are likely to continue to evolve in the future.\nAlthough we have implemented measures designed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business, our ongoing efforts to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in laws and regulations entail substantial expenses and may divert resources from other initiatives. These changes have in the past increased, and may continue to increase, our cost of providing our products and services, could limit us from offering certain solutions in certain jurisdictions, could adversely affect our sales cycles, and could impact our new technology innovation. In addition, our cloud software solutions store data on behalf of our customers, and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws and regulations, such non-compliance could result in litigation or reputational harm to us. Any perceived inability to adequately address privacy, data localization or cyber security compliance or to comply with more complex and numerous laws and regulations, even if unfounded, could result in liability to us and indemnification obligations, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of our solutions or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our cloud operations, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in the number of customers and data volumes serviced by our cloud infrastructure in recent years. While we have designed our cloud infrastructure to meet the current and anticipated future performance and accessibility needs of our customers, we must manage our cloud operations in order to handle changes in hardware and software parameters, spikes in customer usage and new versions of our software. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, system disruptions, outages and other cloud infrastructure performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks (internal or external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service issues and other Security Incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis and for certain of our products we also offer response time commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level or response time commitments, or if we suffer extended periods of unavailability for our solutions, we may be contractually obligated to issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, or customers may choose to terminate or not renew contracts. Any extended service outages or other performance problems could also result in damage to our reputation or our customers\u2019 businesses, cause our customers to elect not to renew or to delay or withhold payment to us, loss of future sales, lead to customers making other claims against us that could harm our subscription revenues, result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, increase collection cycles for our accounts receivable or lead to the expense and risk of litigation.\nWe are a multinational corporation, which subjects us to increased risks that may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from our customers outside the U.S. To date, the majority of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies. To date, we have not used risk management techniques or \"hedged\" the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue and operating margins, are subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regulatory, political, social and economic developments or instability in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional financial information about geographic areas, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, requiring resources and management attention, and may subject us to new or larger levels of regulatory, economic, foreign currency exchange, tax and political risks. We have customers in over 55 countries internationally, which we service through our operations in the U.S., Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom. We expect our international operations to continue to grow. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us with respect to our international operations are:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in various parts of the world;\n\u2022\ntemporary or sustained disruption to international travel such as outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor and employment regulations, especially where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing our international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifferent and more stringent data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nless favorable intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance and penalties for noncompliance with foreign laws and laws applicable to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nthe risk that illegal or unethical activities of our employees or business partners will be attributed to or result in liability to us or damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing tax laws and regulations that may affect both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;\n\u2022\navailability of sufficient network connectivity required for certain of our products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially in developing countries; and\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, import and export controls and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our solutions in certain foreign markets.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our executives and other key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to attract additional qualified sales, marketing, professional services, product development and other personnel, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends upon the performance and service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The failure of our executives and key personnel to effectively manage our business or the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key personnel could harm our operations. In addition, our future success could depend on our ability to timely identify, attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. We have continued to add a significant number of new personnel to support our continued growth, and their ability to learn our business and manage it effectively could be important to our continued growth and expansion. In addition, given the highly sophisticated artificial intelligence included in our solutions, the pool of data scientists and software developers qualified to work on our solutions is limited. The implementation of certain of our software solutions requires highly-qualified personnel, and hiring and retaining such personnel to support our growth may be challenging. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that may have greater resources than we do. If our key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may vary and may not fully reflect the performance of our business.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any quarter may not be reflected in our revenue for that quarter. However, any such decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market demand of our services or potential decreases in our retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. We may be unable to timely adjust our cost structure to reflect changes in revenues. In addition, a significant\nmajority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could result in our recognition of more costs than revenues in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. In addition, we may experience seasonal variations in our cash flows from operating activities, including, as a result of the timing of payment of payroll taxes, performance bonuses to our employees and costs associated with annual company-wide events, each of which have historically been highest in our first fiscal quarter. Therefore, the results of any prior quarterly periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe markets for enterprise software applications for selling improvement (including configure-price-quote solutions and pricing), airline revenue optimization (including revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail solutions) are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies to the extent the markets in which we compete continue to develop and expand, as well as through industry consolidation, including through a merger or partnership of two or more of our competitors or the acquisition of a competitor by a larger company. Some of our current and potential competitors may have larger installed bases of users, longer operating histories, broader distribution and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of these companies have significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nCompetition could seriously impede our ability to sell our software solutions and services on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive. In addition, if these competitors develop solutions with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, or if they offer solutions with similar functionality at a substantially lower price than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins could be reduced and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we do not compete successfully against current or future competitors, competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs we expand our software product portfolio, we could face increased competition as part of entering new markets.\nThe market for our products is competitive, and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future as we expand our product portfolio and features. We may not compete successfully against future potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition. For example, we compete with sales enablement, configure-price-quote, revenue management, and airline shopping, merchandising and retailing software. Large companies in these spaces may have advantages over us because of their greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product portfolios, larger distribution channels, or greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.\nIf our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position could suffer.\nWe spend substantial amounts of time and money to enhance our existing products, as well as to research and develop new products. We introduce new products and incorporate additional features, improve functionality or add other enhancements to our existing products in order to meet our customers' demands. Our new products or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including delays in introducing new, enhanced or modified products; defects, errors or failures in any of our products; and disruptions or delays in the availability and delivery of our products. If our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position could be impaired, our revenue could be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research and development, marketing, sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product.\nWe focus primarily on selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, and if the markets for this software develop more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.\nWe derive most of our revenue from providing our software solutions for selling improvement (including our configure-price-quote solutions), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including our revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including our shopping, merchandising and retail solutions), as well as providing implementation services and ongoing customer support. The selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce markets are evolving rapidly, and it is\nuncertain whether software for these markets will achieve and sustain high levels of demand. Our success depends on the willingness of businesses in our target markets to use selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to implement such software for a number of reasons, including failure to understand the potential returns of improving their processes and lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that such software may provide. Some businesses may elect to improve their sales and pricing processes through solutions obtained from their existing enterprise software providers, whose solutions are designed principally to address functional areas other than what our solutions provide. If businesses do not embrace the benefits of selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, the market for such software may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nWe might not generate increased business from our customers, which could limit our revenue in the future.\nWe sell our software solutions to both new customers and existing customers. Many of our existing customers initially purchase our software solutions for a specific business segment or a specific geographic location within their organization and later purchase additional software solutions for the same or other business segments and geographic locations within their organization. These customers might not choose to make additional purchases of our software solutions or to expand their existing software solutions to other business segments. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our software solutions or introduce new software solutions, our current customers could choose not to purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our existing customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nIf we fail to migrate customers with on-premises software licenses to our latest cloud software solutions, our future revenue may be limited and our costs to provide support to those customers may increase.\nCustomers with on-premises licenses for our legacy software may need to migrate to our current cloud solutions to take advantage of our latest features and functionality which are only available via the PROS cloud. Although we intend to continue to support our legacy on-premises software customers under perpetual licenses for the foreseeable future, we continue to focus on migrating such customers to our cloud solutions. Historically, customers who purchased on-premises licenses for our solutions may have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in our legacy software. In addition, when considering whether to migrate, these customers may evaluate alternative solutions due to the additional change management and implementation costs associated with migrating to cloud-based applications. When on-premises software customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, our internal development and customer support teams find it increasingly difficult and costly to support a declining number of on-premises customers. In addition, if our legacy on-premises license customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, choose alternative solutions or otherwise choose to not continue doing business with us by, for example, canceling maintenance, our future revenue may be limited.\nFailure to adequately expand and train our direct and indirect sales force may impede our growth.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been attributable to the efforts of our direct sales force. We believe that our future growth will depend, to a significant extent, on the continued development of our direct sales force, and our sales team's ability to manage and retain our existing customer base, expand our sales to existing customers and obtain new customers. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take a number of months before becoming fully productive, if at all. If we are unable to develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, our growth may be impeded.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we have developed, and expect to expand, our indirect sales force via channel partners, such as management consulting firms, systems integrators and other resellers, to market, sell and/or implement our solutions. We anticipate that channel partners will become an increasingly important driver of our sales growth, particularly as more channel partners become resellers of our solutions. We expect to invest significant resources to identify, establish, train and retain successful strategic resell partner relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain our partner relationships, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our sales growth rates may be limited.\nOur convertible debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future.\nIn May 2019, we issued $143.8 million principal amount of 1.0% convertible senior notes (\u201c2024 Notes\u201d) due May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of December 31, 2019, the entire $143.8 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes is outstanding. Our indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions\nand general corporate or other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to timely make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, and/or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nWe have experienced losses since we transitioned to a cloud strategy in 2015, and may continue to incur losses for longer than we expect.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to exceed our revenues in the near term as we continue to make investments as part of our cloud strategy, particularly in new product development, sales, marketing, security, privacy and cloud operations. Our ability to return to profitability depends on our ability to: continue to drive subscription sales, enhance our existing products and develop new products, scale our sales and marketing and product development organizations, successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies, renew our subscription agreements with existing customers, and manage our expenses. If we are not able to execute on these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, our operating results could be adversely affected and we may continue to incur net losses in the future. Additionally, our new initiatives may not generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe have completed four acquisitions since 2013, and we plan to continue to acquire other businesses, technologies and products that we intend to complement our existing business, solutions, services and technologies. We cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions we have made or may make in the future will provide us with the benefits or achieve the results we anticipated when entering into the transaction(s). Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndisruption of ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our solutions and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nIn addition, we may incur debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have historically been subject to lengthy sales cycles, and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and cause our revenue and operating income to decline in the future.\nWhile our sales cycle times have continued to improve relative to our prior historical averages since we shifted to a cloud strategy in 2015, our sales cycles may take a month to over a year for large enterprise customers. A large enterprise customer\u2019s\ndecision to use our solutions typically involves a number of internal approvals, and sales to those prospective customers generally require us to provide greater levels of education about the benefits of our solutions. We expend substantial resources during our sales cycles with no assurance that a sale may ultimately result. The length of each individual sales cycle depends on many factors, a number of which we cannot control, including the prospective customer's internal evaluation and approval process requirements, as well as the prospective customer's budget and/or resource constraints. Any unexpected lengthening of the sales cycle or failure to secure anticipated orders could negatively affect our revenue. Any significant failure to generate sales after incurring costs related to our sales process could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny unauthorized, and potentially improper, actions of our personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe recognition of our revenue depends on, among other things, the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers. Our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, but there can be no assurance that such policies would be followed. For instance, in the event that our sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our plans. Furthermore, depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of the transactions involved, we may have to restate revenue for a previously reported period, which could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nDefects or errors in our software solutions could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors. Several of our solutions have recently been developed and may therefore be more likely to contain undetected defects or errors. In addition, we frequently develop enhancements to our software solutions that may contain defects. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases of our solutions to correct defects or errors. The occurrence of any defects or errors could result in:\n\u2022\ndelayed market acceptance and lost sales of our software solutions;\n\u2022\ndelays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources;\n\u2022\nlegal claims, including product liability claims, against us;\n\u2022\nincreased maintenance and support expenses; and\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs.\nOur agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for defects and errors in our software solutions and damages relating to such defects and errors, but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that our current liability insurance coverage would continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the insurer may deny coverage on any future claims. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, even if we prevail in any litigation, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot, however, be certain that steps we take to protect our intellectual property are adequate.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. The procurement and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual considerations, and the associated legal standards are not always applied predictably or uniformly, can change, and may not provide adequate remedies. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights, and other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand, competitive business position, business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims may cause us to incur significant expense or prevent us from selling our software solutions.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third-party may assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights, or we may become the subject of a material intellectual property dispute. Selling improvement (including configure-price-quote), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including revenue management) and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail) solutions may become increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of such commercially available solutions increases and the functionality of these solutions overlaps. In addition, changes in patent laws in the U.S. may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. Future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own potential patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of others, responding to such claims may require us to:\n\u2022\nincur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts to defend such claims;\n\u2022\npay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights;\n\u2022\ncease making, selling or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022\ndistract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us;\n\u2022\nenter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022\nexpend additional development resources to redesign our solutions.\nAny licenses required as a result of litigation under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively develop or market our solutions, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or maintain profitability.\nOur contract terms generally obligate us to indemnify and hold our customers harmless from certain costs arising from third party claims brought against our customers alleging that the use of our solutions infringe intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to resolve our legal obligations by settling or paying an infringement claim, we may be required to compensate our customers.\nWe use open source software in our solutions that may subject our software solutions to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause harm to our business.\nWe use open source software in our solutions and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition, open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe utilize third-party software that we incorporate into our software solutions, and impaired relations with these third parties, defects in third-party software or a third party\u2019s inability or failure to enhance their software over time could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.\nWe incorporate and include third-party software into our software solutions. If our relations with any of these third parties are impaired, or if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our solutions could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties may continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our operations.\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, and we conduct business in other domestic and international locations. We also rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications for our sales, marketing, development, professional services, operational support and hosted services. Although we have contingency and business continuity plans in effect for natural disasters and other catastrophic events (including terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attacks, hurricanes and outbreaks of contagious diseases), these events could disrupt our operations. Even though we carry business interruption insurance and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses from business interruptions that exceed the coverage under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or other catastrophic event could create a negative perception in the marketplace, delay our product innovations, or lead to lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and losses of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\") and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and rules currently proposed or subsequently implemented by the SEC and NYSE impose heightened requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. We may also need to hire additional personnel to support our compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial costs and make some activities more time-consuming.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in existing\nprinciples, standards or guidance, in particular those related to revenue recognition, can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") is currently working with the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") to converge certain accounting principles and to facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow GAAP and those that are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). These projects may result in different accounting principles under GAAP, which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results. In addition, the SEC may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of IFRS into the financial reporting system for U.S. companies. Changes in accounting principles from GAAP to IFRS, or to converged accounting principles, may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions.\nIf we fail to continue to maintain internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our market price may be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to provide a report by our registered independent public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to continue to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, if a material weakness is identified in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to implement internal controls over financial reporting for our acquisitions, our financial results may be adversely affected and we could lose investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Accordingly failure to maintain effective controls over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks relating to ownership of our common stock and the 2024 Notes\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the software industry generally, has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Volatility could make it difficult to trade shares of our common stock at predictable prices or times. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile, including the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ndecreases in market valuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\ndecreases in financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of significant contracts, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and standards affecting the software industry and our software solutions;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u2022\ndamages, settlements, legal fees and other costs related to litigation, claims and other contingencies;\n\u2022\ndeterioration of the general U.S. and global economic condition; and\n\u2022\nother risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our operations. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur directors, executive officers, and certain significant stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding shares.\nAt December 31, 2019, our directors and executive officers collectively control approximately 9.6% of our issued and outstanding common shares, and together with certain significant stockholders, including investment funds associated with Brown Capital Management, LLC, Vanguard Group Inc., Primecap Management Company, BlackRock, Inc. and D.F. Dent & Company, control approximately 52% of our issued and outstanding common shares. In the event that these stockholders each independently decided to vote for or against matters requiring stockholder approval, they could influence such matters in ways that may not align with your specific interests as a stockholder, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could affect the market price of our shares if there is a sale by this group of stockholders, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if such change of control could be beneficial to you as a stockholder.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital, repayment of debt and for other general corporate purposes. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2024 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20,\nan entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 2024 Notes and the previously issued convertible notes with original due dates in 2019 and 2047 (the \"2019 Notes\" and \"2047 Notes,\" and together with the 2024 Notes, the \"Notes\") that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2024 Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2024 Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2024 Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2024 Notes.", "PERMNO": 92143, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRO"}
