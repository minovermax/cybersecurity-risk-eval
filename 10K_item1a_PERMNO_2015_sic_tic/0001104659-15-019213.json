An investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this registration statement. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our securities could decline, and an investor may lose all or part of his or her investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a development stage company and we may never earn a profit.\nWe are a development stage company and have incurred losses since we were formed. As of December 31, 2014, we have an accumulated total deficit of approximately $81.4 million. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we had a net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $14.3 million. To date, we have experienced negative cash flow from development of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. We have not generated any revenue from operations except for licensing, milestone and royalty income and expect to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future to further develop and commercialize the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. We cannot predict the extent of these future net losses, or when we may attain profitability, if at all. If we are unable to generate significant revenue from the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology or attain profitability, we will not be able to sustain operations.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology and any future tests, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if ever. We may never become profitable and you may never receive a return on an investment in our common stock. An investor in our common stock must carefully consider the substantial challenges, risks and uncertainties inherent in the attempted development and commercialization of tests in the medical diagnostic industry. We may never successfully commercialize cell-free molecular diagnostic technology or any future tests, and our business may fail.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or collaboration efforts.\nAs of February 27, 2015, our cash balance was approximately $46.0 million and our working capital was approximately $42.0 million. Due to our recurring losses from operations and the expectation that we will continue to incur losses in the future, we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates. This amount will be sufficient to launch our products in the marketplace currently under development as LDTs. We have historically relied upon private and public sales of our equity to fund our operations. We currently have a $15.0 million loan payable. When we seek additional capital, we may seek to sell additional equity and/or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, restrict our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, contains certain covenants that could adversely affect our operations and, if an event of default were to occur, we could be forced to repay the outstanding indebtedness sooner than planned and possibly at a time when we do not have sufficient capital to meet this obligation. The occurrence of any of these events could cause a significant adverse impact on our business, prospects and stock price.\nWe have entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford and SVB for a term loan of $15 million. The term loan is secured by all of our assets, other than intellectual property. The Loan and Security Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u00b7 incur liens;\n\u00b7 make investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u00b7 consolidate or merge;\n\u00b7 sell or assign any part of our business or property;\n\u00b7 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 pay dividends.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement also includes events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults; breaches of representations, warranties or covenants; certain insolvency events; and the occurrence of certain material adverse changes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and following any cure periods (if applicable), a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\nThese terms of the Loan and Security Agreement could prevent us from taking certain actions without the consent of our lenders and, if an event of default should occur, we could be required to immediately repay the outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to repay this debt, the lenders would be able to foreclose on the secured collateral, including our cash accounts, and take other remedies permitted under the Loan and Security Agreement. Even if we are able to repay the indebtedness on an event of default, the repayment of these sums may significantly reduce our working capital and impair our ability to operate as planned. The occurrence of any of these events could cause a significant adverse impact on our business, prospects and stock price.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our technology will depend largely upon the extent to which third-party payors reimburse our tests.\nPhysicians and patients may decide not to order our products unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid pay a substantial portion of the test price.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that our product candidates are:\n\u00b7 not experimental or investigational;\n\u00b7 effective;\n\u00b7 medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective;\n\u00b7 supported by peer-reviewed publications; and\n\u00b7 included in clinical practice guidelines.\nMarket acceptance, sales of products based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, and our profitability may depend on reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Several entities conduct technology assessments of medical tests and devices and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and health care providers as grounds to deny coverage for a test or procedure. The levels at which government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, may reimburse the price patients pay for such products could affect whether we are able to commercialize our products. Our product candidates may receive negative assessments that may impact our ability to receive reimbursement of the test. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse our test, seeking these approvals may be a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be sure that reimbursement in the U.S. or elsewhere will be available for any of our products in the future. If reimbursement is not available or is limited, we may not be able to commercialize our products.\nIf we are unable to obtain reimbursement approval from private payors and Medicare and Medicaid programs for our product candidates, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues could be limited. Even if we are being reimbursed, insurers may withdraw their coverage policies or cancel their contracts with us at any time, stop paying for our test or reduce the payment rate for our test, which would reduce our revenue. Moreover, we may depend upon a limited number of third-party payors for a significant portion of our test revenues and if these or other third-party payors stop providing reimbursement or decrease the amount of reimbursement for our test, our revenues could decline.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new coding for molecular genetic tests.\nIf our technology were commercially available today, reimbursement would be available under the current procedural terminology, or CPT codes, for molecular-based testing. The American Medical Association CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel is continuing its process of establishing analyte specific billing codes to replace codes that describe procedures used in performing molecular testing. The adoption of analyte specific codes will allow payers to better determine tests being performed. This could lead to limited coverage decisions or payment denials.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of these products among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community and on our ability to successfully market our product candidates.\nThe use of the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology has never been commercialized for any indication. Even if approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory authorities, physicians may not order diagnostic tests based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, in which event we may be unable to generate significant revenue or become profitable. Acceptance of the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology will depend on a number of factors including:\n\u00b7 acceptance of products based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology by physicians and patients;\n\u00b7 successful integration into clinical practice;\n\u00b7 adequate reimbursement by third parties;\n\u00b7 cost effectiveness;\n\u00b7 potential advantages over alternative treatments; and\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration.\nWe will need to make leading physicians aware of the benefits of tests using our technology through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and favorable results from our clinical studies. In addition, we will need to gain support from thought leaders who believe that testing a urine specimen for these molecular markers will provide superior performance. Ideally, we will need these individuals to publish support papers and articles which will be necessary to gain acceptance of our products. There is\nno guarantee that we will be able to obtain this support. Our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to order cell-free molecular diagnostic testsfor their patients and consequently our revenue and profitability will be limited.\nWe currently have limited experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have limited experience in marketing products. We intend to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other molecular diagnostic companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our product candidates or future products, however, we may not be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nIf our potential medical diagnostic tests are unable to compete effectively with current and future medical diagnostic tests targeting similar markets as our product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe medical diagnostic industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress. In each of our potential product areas, we face significant competition from large biotechnology, medical diagnostic and other companies. The technologies associated with the molecular diagnostics industry are evolving rapidly and there is intense competition within such industry. Certain molecular diagnostics companies have established technologies that may be competitive to our product candidates and any future tests that we develop. Some of these tests may use different approaches or means to obtain diagnostic results, which could be more effective or less expensive than our tests for similar indications. Moreover, these and other future competitors have or may have considerably greater resources than we do in terms of technology, sales, marketing, commercialization and capital resources. These competitors may have substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise, experience in clinical studies, experience in regulatory issues, brand name exposure and expertise in sales and marketing as well as in operating central laboratory services. Many of these organizations have financial, marketing and human resources greater than ours; therefore, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with present or potential competitors or that such competition will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nSince the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology is under development, we cannot predict the relative competitive position of any product based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. However, we expect that the following factors will determine our ability to compete effectively: safety and efficacy; product price; turnaround time; ease of administration; performance; reimbursement; and marketing and sales capability.\nWe believe that many of our competitors spend significantly more on research and development-related activities than we do. Our competitors may discover new diagnostic tools or develop existing technologies to compete with the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if these competing products are more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our product candidates.\nOur failure to obtain human urine samples from medical institutions for our clinical studies will adversely impact the development of our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nWe will need to establish relationships with medical institutions in order to obtain urine specimens from patients who are testing positive for a relevant infectious disease or from patients that have been diagnosed with solid tumors. We must obtain a sufficient number in order to statistically prove the equivalency of the performance of our assays versus existing assays that are already on the market.\nCell-free nucleic acids in urine are stable at room temperature for extended periods of time with the addition of a simple preservative. Successful implementation of our cell-free nucleic acid technology in molecular testing is closely linked to the availability of techniques and procedures for cell-free nucleic acid preservation, purification, and analysis. In the event urine specimens are not adequately preserved, improperly stored, or contaminated, we may be delayed in pursuing our clinical studies, and we may incur additional costs associated with procuring new human urine samples.\nIf our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of our technologies and demonstrate clinical utility of our technology, we may never sell our product candidates and services.\nThe results of our clinical studies may not show that tests using our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology are superior to existing testing methods and demonstrate clinical utility. In that event, we will have to devote significant financial and other resources to further research and development, and commercialization of tests using our technologies will be delayed or may never occur. Our earlier clinical studies were small and included samples from high-risk patients. The results from these earlier studies may not be representative of the results we obtain from any future studies, including our next two clinical studies, which will include substantially more samples and a larger percentage of normal-risk patients.\nWe have limited experience in establishing strong business relationships with leading clinical reference laboratories to perform cell-free molecular diagnostic tests using our technologies which could limit our revenue growth.\nA key step in our strategy is to sell diagnostic products that use our proprietary technologies to leading clinical reference laboratories that will perform cell-free molecular diagnostic tests. We have limited experience in establishing these business relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain these business relationships, we will have limited ability to obtain revenues beyond the revenue we can generate from our limited in-house capacity to process tests.\nWe depend upon our officers, and if we are not able to retain them or recruit additional qualified personnel, the commercialization of our product candidates and any future tests that we develop could be delayed or negatively impacted.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the continued contributions of our officers such as Dr. Antonius Schuh, Chief Executive Officer. Our success also depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, commercial and administrative personnel. In order to pursue our test development and commercialization strategies, we will need to attract and hire, or engage as consultants, additional personnel with specialized experience in a number of disciplines, including assay development, bioinformatics and statistics, laboratory and clinical operations, clinical affairs and studies, government regulation, sales and marketing, billing and reimbursement and information systems. There is intense competition for personnel in the fields in which we operate. If we are unable to attract new employees and retain existing employees, the development and commercialization of our product candidates and any future tests could be delayed or negatively impacted.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company with 31 full-time employees as of February 27, 2015. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate highly skilled personnel. We may increase the number of employees in the future depending on the progress of our development of cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize cell-free molecular diagnostic testsand to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u00b7 manage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u00b7 integrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u00b7 maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u00b7 hire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nWe may need FDA approval to market products based on the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology for diagnostic uses in the United States and approvals from foreign regulatory authorities to market products on the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology outside the United States. We have not yet filed an application with the FDA to obtain approval to market any of our proposed products. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of products based on the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, we will be unable to sell such product candidates and will not be able to sustain operations.\nWe believe the estimated molecular diagnostics market for many diseases in Europe is approximately as large as that of the United States. If we seek to market products or services such as a urine-based HPV HR Detection test in Europe, we need to receive a CE Mark. If we do not obtain a CE Mark for our urine-based HPV HR Detection test, we will be unable to sell this product in Europe and countries that recognize the CE Mark.\nThe regulatory review and approval process, which may include evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical studies of product candidates based on the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology, as well as the evaluation of manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing regulatory approval for products based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology may require the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities to establish such product candidates\u2019 safety and effectiveness for each indication. We have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals.\nRegulatory authorities generally have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept an application, or may decide after review of an application that the data submitted is insufficient to allow approval of any product based upon the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. If regulatory authorities do not accept or approve our applications, they may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical or manufacturing studies and submit that data before regulatory authorities will reconsider such application. We may need to expend substantial resources to conduct further studies to obtain data that regulatory authorities believe is sufficient. Depending on the extent of these studies, approval of applications may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we may have available. It is also possible that additional studies may not suffice to make applications approvable. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our applications for approval, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we do not comply with governmental regulations applicable to our CLIA-certified laboratory, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe establishment and operation of our laboratory is subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States. The laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of compliance and is licensed by every state (other than the State of New York) and the District of Columbia, as required, which enables us to provide testing services to residents of almost every state. Failure to comply with state regulations or changes in state regulatory requirements could result in a substantial curtailment or even prohibition of the operations of our laboratory and could have a material adverse effect on our business. CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. To renew CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of these laboratories. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or our state licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to continue our testing operations which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Potential sanctions for violations of these statutes and regulations also include significant fines, the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspension or recalls.\nChanges in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may delay the commercialization of our tests and increase our costs.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of our diagnostic products and tests in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products and services which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive\nadministration in the United States, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, (\u2018 PPACA\u201d) has substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government health plans and private insurers. The PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations in ways that may negatively affect our potential revenues in the future. While it is too early to predict all the specific effects the PPACA or any future healthcare reform legislation will have on our business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical studies, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical studies and regulatory review, increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of approved products.\nIf the FDA were to begin regulating LDTs, or if we decide to market our products as a medical device rather than a LDT, we could be forced to delay commercialization of our current product candidates, experience significant delays in commercializing any future tests, incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for pre-market clearance or approval and/or experience decreased demand for or reimbursement of our test.\nWe intend to develop products that are considered to be medical devices and are subject to federal regulations including those covering Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) and Medical Device Reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d).\nThe QSR includes requirements related to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for designing, purchasing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing and servicing of medical devices. Manufacturing facilities undergo FDA inspections to assure compliance with the QS requirements. The quality systems for FDA-regulated products are known as current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) as described in the Code of Federal Regulations, part 820 (21 CFR part 820). Among the cGMP requirements are those requiring manufacturers to have sufficient appropriate personnel to implement required design controls and other portions of the QSR guidelines.\nDesign controls include procedures that describe the product design requirements (design goals) and compare actual output to these requirements, including documented Design Reviews. Required Design History Files (\u201cDHFs\u201d) for each device will document the records necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed in accordance with the approved design plan and the requirements of the QSRs.\nQSRs also include stipulation for control of all documents used in design and production, including history of any changes made. Production and process controls include stipulations to ensure products are in fact produced as specified by controlled documents resulting from the controlled design phase, using products and services purchased under controlled purchasing procedures.\nIncidents in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury must to be reported to FDA under the MDR program. In addition, certain malfunctions must also be reported. The MDR regulation is a mechanism for FDA and manufacturers to identify and monitor significant adverse events involving medical devices. The goals of the regulation are to detect and correct problems in a timely manner.\nWe may be required to participate in MDR through two routes. As a manufacturer of products for sale within the United States, we would be required to report to the FDA any deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions, and events requiring remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. Our CLIA lab offering services for sale is already currently required to report suspected medical device related deaths to both the FDA and the relevant manufacturers of products we purchase and use.\nClinical laboratory tests like our current product offerings are regulated in the United States under CLIA as well as by applicable state laws. Diagnostic kits that are sold and distributed through interstate commerce are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use are called LDTs. Most LDTs currently are not subject to FDA regulation, although reagents or software provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. We expect that, upon the commencement of commercialization, our product candidates will be an LDT and not\na diagnostic kit. As a result, we believe that our product candidates should not be subject to regulation under current FDA policies, however there is no assurance that it will not be subject to such regulation in the future. Further, if we decide to market our products as a diagnostic kit rather than a LDT, our products would be subject to FDA regulation as a medical device. The container we expect to provide for collection and transport of tumor samples from a pathology laboratory to our clinical reference laboratory may be a medical device subject to FDA regulation and while we expect that it will be exempt from pre-market review by FDA, there is no certainty in that respect.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review, will not be required in the future for our LDT product candidates, either through new policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation will be enacted into law and may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to offer or continue to offer our product as a clinical laboratory service.\nIf pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling. If pre-market review of our LDTs is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our product offerings will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations, such as the Quality System Regulation and Medical Device Reporting, would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by the FDA and to the requirements of the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of our product offerings if we determine that doing so would be appropriate. Some competitors may develop competing tests cleared for marketing by the FDA. There may be a marketing differentiation or perception that an FDA-cleared test is more desirable than our product offerings, and that could discourage adoption and reimbursement of our test.\nWe may be required to conduct clinical studies and we may find it difficult to enroll patients in such clinical studies, which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates.\nIf the FDA decides to regulate our LDTs, it may require that we conduct extensive pre-market clinical studies prior to submitting a regulatory application for commercial sales. If we are required to conduct pre-market clinical studies, whether using retrospectively collected and banked samples or prospectively collected samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical studies could significantly increase our test development costs and delay commercialization. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by factors such as unforeseen safety issues, lack of effectiveness during clinical trials, inability to monitor patients adequately during or after testing, and slower than expected rates of patient recruitment.\nInsufficient patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. We may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical studies, which might increase the cost of the studies. We will also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the studies properly. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, FDA requirements or for other reasons, our clinical studies may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our test. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our test, or to become profitable.\nIn addition, in the event we are required to conduct clinical trials, it may be very expensive and difficult to design and implement due to the rigorous regulatory requirements to which clinical trials are subjected. Clinical trials are also time consuming, and we would be unable to provide certainty regarding when we might complete the clinical trial process.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies, which would impair our competitive advantage.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents and any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable. We may not be successful in defending challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications.\nIn addition to our patents, we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and employees to also sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights.\nThe patents issued to us may not be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection one or more of our competitors may develop more effective technologies, designs or methods without infringing our intellectual property rights and one or more of our competitors may design around our proprietary technologies.\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how, our competitors may use our inventions to develop competing products. We own certain patents relating to the cell-free molecular diagnostic technology. However, these patents may not protect us against our competitors, and patent litigation is very expensive. We may not have sufficient cash available to pursue any patent litigation to its conclusion because currently we do not generate revenues other than licensing, milestone and royalty income.\nWe cannot rely solely on our current patents to be successful. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent office\u2019s use to grant patents, and the standards that U.S. and foreign courts use to interpret patents, are not the same and are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. As such, the degree of patent protection obtained in the U.S. may differ substantially from that obtained in various foreign countries. In some instances, patents have been issued in the U.S. while substantially less or no protection has been obtained in Europe or other countries.\nWe cannot be certain of the level of protection, if any, which will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court where our competitors may raise defenses such as invalidity, unenforceability or possession of a valid license. In addition, the type and extent of any patent claims that may be issued to us in the future are uncertain. Any patents which are issued may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of our patents and other intellectual property rights, resulting in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive proceedings, which could deprive us of valuable rights. If we become involved in any intellectual property litigation, interference or other judicial or administrative proceedings, we will incur substantial expenses and the diversion of financial resources and technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, we may be required to pay substantial financial damages, which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful, or be required to discontinue or significantly delay development, marketing, selling and licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights. In our European patent that covers using microRNAs to detect in vivo cell death, an anonymous third party has recently filed an opposition against the claims in the patent. Oppositions against the patentability of claims in a European patent are considered by a panel of examiners at the European Patent Office, and we are considering the full range of options available for defending against the opposition.\nOur competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. There may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into\nroyalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may also become subject to injunctions against the further development and use of our technology, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic devices entails an inherent risk of product liability and personal injury claims.\nTo date, we have experienced no product liability or personal injury claims, but any such claims arising in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Potential product liability or personal injury claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy or limited by other claims under our umbrella insurance policy. Additionally, our existing insurance may not be renewed by us at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect, if at all. In the event that we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, such claim could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and thus potentially a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll of our diagnostic technology and services are performed at a single laboratory, and in the event this facility was to be affected by a termination of the lease or a man-made or natural disaster, our operations could be severely impaired.\nWe are performing all of our diagnostic services in our laboratory located in San Diego, California. Despite precautions taken by us, any future natural or man-made disaster at this laboratory, such as a fire, earthquake or terrorist activity, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment and urine samples or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nIn addition, we are leasing the facilities where our lab operates. We are currently in compliance with all and any lease obligations, but should the lease terminate for any reason, or if at any time the lab is moved due to conditions outside our control, it could cause substantial delay in our diagnostics operations, damage or destroy our equipment and biological samples or cause us to incur additional expenses. In the event of an extended shutdown of our laboratory, we may be unable to perform our services in a timely manner or at all and therefore would be unable to operate in a commercially competitive manner. This could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFurther, if we have to use a substitute laboratory while our facility was shut down, we could only use another facility with established state licensure and accreditation under CLIA. We may not be able to find another CLIA-certified facility and comply with applicable procedures, or find any such laboratory that would be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, any new laboratory opened by us would be subject to certification under CLIA and licensure by various states, which would take a significant amount of time and result in delays in our ability to continue our personalized medicine services operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nIf we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover additional material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, we cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation gives our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock. As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a\nchange of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any new series of preferred stock and the certificate of designation relating to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock restricts our ability to issue additional series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future. Without the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock we may not alter or change adversely the rights of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, create a class of stock which is senior to or on a parity with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, amend our certificate of incorporation in breach of these provisions or agree to any of the foregoing.\nOur common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our ordinary shares historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations over short periods of time. For example, the closing price of our common stock during the past 52-weeks has ranged from a low of $3.00 to a high of $6.74. These fluctuations may be due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results relating to our tests or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements or press releases relating to the industry or to our own business or prospects;\n\u00b7 coverage and reimbursement decisions by third party payors, such as Medicare and other managed care organizations;\n\u00b7 regulation and oversight of our product candidates and services, including by the FDA, CMS and comparable ex-U.S. agency;\n\u00b7 FDA, CMS and comparable ex-U.S. agency regulation and oversight of our products and services;\n\u00b7 the establishment of partnerships with clinical reference laboratories;\n\u00b7 health care legislation;\n\u00b7 intellectual property disputes;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 industry developments;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors; and\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions could adversely affect the market price of our securities. Because we are a development stage company with no revenue from operations to date, other than licensing, milestone and royalty income, you should consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the foregoing.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of February 27, 2015, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 29.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u00b7 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u00b7 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u00b7 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nNo cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, under the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement, we are precluded from paying cash dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders, and the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock prohibit us from paying dividends to the holders of our common stock so long as any dividends due on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock remain unpaid. Investors in our common stock should not rely on an investment in our company if they require dividend income.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws will contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. For example, our board of directors have the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval. The ability to issue preferred stock could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company, or otherwise could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations.\nFurthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market and, despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nWe may be subject to stockholder litigation, thereby diverting our resources that may have a material effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nAs discussed in the preceding risk factors, the market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility, and we expect that our share price will continue to be at least as volatile for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. In addition, many companies have actions brought against them by stockholders relating to past transactions or other matters Any such actions could give rise to substantial damages, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. Even if an action is not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with stockholder actions could harm our business, financial condition and reputation. Litigation can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to business operations. The defense of lawsuits could also result in diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 13411, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CRDF"}
