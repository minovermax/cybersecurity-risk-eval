Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses since inception and if we continue to incur losses, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.\nWe experienced losses from inception through June 30, 2012, and from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2019. For fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we incurred a net loss of $32.0 million, $11.3 million, and $7.5 million, respectively. In light of our recent history of losses as well as the length of our history of losses, profitability in the foreseeable future is not assured. Until the Company\u2019s products and services can generate sufficient annual revenues, the Company will be required to use its cash and cash equivalents on hand and may raise capital to meet its cash flow requirements including the issuance of common stock or debt financing. Additionally, if we continue to incur losses in the future, the price of our common stock can be expected to fall.\nWe may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.\nAt June 30, 2019, we had net working capital of $2.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of $27.5 million. We had net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of $(28.7) million, $12.4 million, and $(6.1) million for fiscal years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Unless we maintain or grow our current level of operations, we may need additional funds to continue these operations. We may also need additional capital to respond to unusual or unanticipated non-operational events. Such non-operational events include but are not limited to full remediation of internal control deficiencies that existed as of June 30, 2019 and shareholder class action lawsuits, government inquiries or enforcement actions that could potentially arise from the circumstances that gave rise to our restatements and extended filing delay in filing our periodic reports. Should the financing that we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur existing loan agreement contains restrictions which may limit our flexibility in operating and growing our business.\nOur existing loan agreement contains covenants regarding our maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio, each as defined in our loan agreement. Additionally, the loan agreement requires us to deliver to our bank, among other things, audited and unaudited financial statements on a periodic basis. We are not in compliance with these covenants and have obtained waivers and extensions of time to deliver such financial statements until October 31, 2019. Future failures to be in compliance with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and net income.\nWe have derived, and believe we may continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from one large customer or a limited number of large customers. Customer concentrations for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nFor the year ended June 30,\nSingle customer\nTotal revenue\n%\n%\n%\nThe loss of such customers could materially adversely affect our revenues. Additionally, a major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively affect our financial performance. We have offered, and may in the future offer, discounts to our large customers to incentivize them to continue to utilize our products and services. If we are required to sell products to any of our large customers at reduced prices or unfavorable terms, our results of operations and revenue could be materially adversely affected. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services as our customer agreements are generally cancelable by the customer on thirty to sixty days\u2019 notice. Additionally, the Audit Committee\u2019s internal investigation of certain matters that was commenced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and the resulting delay in the filing of the Company\u2019s periodic reports could affect the willingness of potential customers to purchase the Company\u2019s products and services and of existing customers to continue their relationship with the Company without revised terms and/or special provisions.\nWe depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, or if we are unable to attract highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on key management personnel, particularly the Chief Executive Officer, Stephen P. Herbert. The loss of services of Mr. Herbert or other officers could dramatically affect our business prospects. Our executive officers and certain of our officers and employees are particularly valuable to us because:\n\u2022\nthey have specialized knowledge about our company and operations\u037e\n\u2022\nthey have specialized skills that are important to our operations\u037e or\n\u2022\nthey would be particularly difficult to replace.\nWe have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Herbert, which contains confidentiality and non-compete provisions. The agreement provided for an initial term continuing through January 1, 2013, which is automatically renewed for consecutive one year periods unless terminated by either Mr. Herbert or the Company upon at least 90 days\u2019 notice prior to the end of the initial term or any one-year extension thereof.\nOur success and future growth also depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team, many of whom are recent hires, including our interim Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Compliance Officer. Further, potential reputational harm arising from the restatements and extended delay in filing our periodic reports may make it difficult for us to retain these new hires and other existing senior management, sales personnel, and development and engineering personnel critical to our ability to execute our business plan, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. We may experience a loss of productivity due to the departure of key personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge, or while new personnel integrate into our business and transition into their respective roles. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team.\nOur dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nChallenge to our ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our technology may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nAs of June 30, 2019, the United States Government and other countries have granted us 130 patents, of which 87 are still in force. We had 14 pending United States and foreign patent applications, and will consider filing applications for additional patents covering aspects of our future developments, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain or prosecute these applications. There can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\nany of the remaining patent applications will be granted to us\u037e\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional products that are patentable or that do not infringe the patents of others\u037e\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products\u037e\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others\u037e or\n\u2022\nany of our products would not infringe the patents of others.\nIf any of our products or services is found to have infringed any patent, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to continue to manufacture, use, sell, and license such product or service or that we will not have to pay damages and/or be enjoined as a result of such infringement.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or fail to enforce or prosecute our patents against others, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers and our business being adversely affected. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs and diverts Company resources\nas well as the attention of our management. There can be no assurance we will have the necessary financial resources to appropriately defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights in connection with any such litigation.\nIf we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop new products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for cashless payments and cloud and mobile solutions for the self-service retail markets. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in proximity payment devices. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer to our customers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software, communication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe termination of our relationships with certain third-party suppliers upon whom we rely for services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan.\nThe operation of our wireless networked devices depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of services provided to us by our wireless telecommunication services providers, AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless. In addition, if we terminate relationships with our current telecommunications service providers, we may have to replace hardware that is part of our existing ePort or Seed products that are already installed in the marketplace in order to make them compatible with a new network. This could significantly harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.\nSubstantially all of the network service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty to sixty days\u2019 advance notice.\nSubstantially all of our customers may terminate their network service contracts with us for any or no reason upon providing us with thirty or sixty days\u2019 advance notice. Accordingly, consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, defects, or dissatisfaction with our products or services or competition in the marketplace could cause us to lose a substantial number of our customers with minimal notice. If a substantial number of our customers were to exercise their termination rights, it would result in a material adverse effect to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSecurity is vital to our customers and therefore breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to transmit financial information of consumers making cashless transactions and to provide accounting and inventory management services to our customers. As such, the information we transmit and/or maintain are exposed to the ever-evolving threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by consumers, customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks, including being certified for PCI compliance, may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact the marketplace acceptance of our products and services, and could result in significant remedial expenses to not only assess and repair any damage to our systems, but also to reimburse customers for losses that occur from the fraudulent use of confidential data. Additionally, we could become subject to significant fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nFurther, substantially all of the cashless payment transactions handled by our network involve Visa or MasterCard. If we fail to comply with the applicable standards or requirements of the Visa and MasterCard card associations relating to security, Visa or MasterCard could suspend or terminate our registration with them. The termination of our registration with them or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration with them could require us to stop providing cashless payment services through our network. In such event, our business plan and/or competitive advantages in the market place would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on other card payment processors, and if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services, our customer relationships could be adversely affected, and we could lose business.\nWe rely on agreements with other large payment processing organizations, primarily Chase Paymentech and Global Payments, Inc., formerly Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture and transmission, settlement and merchant accounting services for the customers we serve. The termination by our card processing providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively will adversely affect our relationships with the customers whose accounts we serve and may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.\nDisruptions at other participants in the financial system could prevent us from delivering our cashless payment services.\nThe operations and systems of many participants in the financial system are interconnected. Many of the transactions that involve our cashless payment services rely on multiple participants in the financial system to accurately move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. A disruption for any reason at one of the participants in the financial system could impact our ability to cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our services. Although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. Such a disruption could lead to the inability for us to deliver services, reputational damage, lost customers and lost revenue, loss of customers\u2019 confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, financial condition, and future growth.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are, among other things, subject to banking regulations and credit card association regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the suspension of our business, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of fines that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us or our product offerings. To the extent this occurs, we could be subject to additional technical, contractual or other requirements as a condition of our continuing to conduct our payment processing business. These requirements could cause us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, or to lose revenues to the extent we do not comply with these requirements.\nNew legislation could be enacted regulating the basis upon which interchange rates are charged for debit or credit card transactions, which could increase the debit or credit card interchange fees charged by bankcard networks. An example of such legislation is the so-called \u201cDurbin Amendment,\u201d an amendment to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Durbin Amendment regulates the basis upon which interchange rates for debit card transactions are made to ensure that interchange rates are \u201creasonable and proportionate to costs.\u201d Pursuant to regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Reserve, Visa and MasterCard have significantly increased their interchange fees for small ticket debit card transactions.\nIncreases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nWe are obligated to pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process through our network. From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees, known as interchange fees that they charge. Under our processing agreements with our customers, we are permitted to pass along these fee increases to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. Passing along such increases could result in some of our customers canceling their contracts with us. Consequently, it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our Company absorbing some or all of the increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our gross profit and adversely affect our business.\nAs of July 1, 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d), pursuant to which Visa has agreed to continue to make available to the Company certain promotional interchange reimbursement fees for small ticket debit and credit\ncard transactions. Similarly, MasterCard International Incorporated (\"MasterCard\") has agreed to make available to us reduced interchange rates for small ticket debit card transactions through March 1, 2019, and for successive one-year periods thereafter unless the agreement between the parties is terminated by either party upon sixty days' notice prior to the end of any such one-year renewal period. During the term of the Visa Agreement, the Company does not anticipate accepting any debit cards with interchange fees that are higher than the rates provided under the Visa Agreement. The Company will continue to accept Visa- and MasterCard- branded debit cards in addition to all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express at its current processing rates. If the Visa or MasterCard Agreements are not extended, our financial results would be materially adversely affected unless we are able to pass these significant additional charges to our customers.\nAny increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the event a dispute between a cardholder and a customer is not resolved in favor of the customer, the transaction is normally charged back to the customer and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. When we serve as merchant of record, if we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer's account, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have policies to manage customer-related credit risk and attempt to mitigate such risk by monitoring transaction activity. Notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could result in additional costs being incurred for remediation, cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting, and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015. Additionally, the Board of Directors of the Company, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and following discussions with management, determined that the following financial statements previously issued by the Company should no longer be relied upon: (1) the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, (2) the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, (3) the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, and (4) the quarterly and year-to-date unaudited consolidated financial statements for September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. Similarly, it was determined that reliance should not be placed on the management\u2019s report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017. Additionally, we have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2019 due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2019, all as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K. Remediation efforts to address the identified weaknesses are ongoing and we were not able to fully remediate our material weaknesses in internal controls as of June 30, 2019, and we cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective as of June 30, 2020. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and to continue to improve the procedures and controls relating to our operational and financial systems, as well as to continue to expand, train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal controls. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues.\nIf our remediation measures are insufficient to address the identified deficiencies, or if additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Failures in internal controls may negatively affect investor confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our shares, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties and/or shareholder litigation, and materially adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nShareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nThe circumstances that gave rise to our restatement and extended delays in filing our periodic reports and in holding an annual meeting of shareholders has increased the risk that we may be subject to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others, such as shareholder proposals, media campaigns, proxy contests and other such actions. Responding to proxy contests or such other actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board and management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or potential changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, loss of potential business opportunities, instability or lack of continuity. This may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. On May 20, 2019, Hudson Executive Capital LP filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC reporting that it was the beneficial owner of 12% of our common stock, by an amendment thereto filed on August 5, 2019, reported that it was the beneficial owner of 14% of our common stock, and, by an amendment thereto filed on September 27, 2019, reported that it was the beneficial owner of 16.9% of our common stock.\nThe accounting review of our previously issued financial statements and the audits of prior fiscal years have been time-consuming and expensive, has resulted in the filing of class action lawsuits and the receipt of derivative demand letters, and may result in additional expense and/or litigation.\nWe have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the Audit Committee\u2019s investigation, the review of our accounting, the audits, the restatements of previously filed financial statements, bank consents, and the ongoing remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company incurred various expenses including those relating to the internal investigation in the amount of $13.5 million, relating to the restatement in the amount of $1.9 million, and relating to pending class action litigation in the amount of $0.5 million. To the extent that steps we are continuing to take to reduce errors in accounting determinations are not successful, we could be forced to incur significant additional time and expense. The incurrence of significant additional expense, or the requirement that management devote significant time that could reduce the time available to execute on our business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will not receive inquiries from the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities regarding our restated financial statements or matters relating thereto, or that we will not be subject to future claims, investigations or proceedings. Any future inquiries from the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authority, or future claims or proceedings or any related regulatory investigation will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional legal and accounting costs.\nWe are also subject to a shareholder class action arising out of the misstatements in our financial statements or public filings. For additional discussion, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and \"Legal Matters\" in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our management has been, and may in the future be, required to devote significant time and attention to this litigation, and this and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as well as on our reputation. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant expense defending this litigation and expect to continue to need to incur significant expense.\nWe and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nWe and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits, and may become subject to further litigation, government investigations or proceedings arising therefrom. The pending litigation has been, and any future litigation, investigation or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us or our current or former officers or directors may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses we may incur in these litigation matters, and contingencies related to our obligations under the federal and state securities laws, or in other legal proceedings or governmental investigations or proceedings related to these matters.\nTo date, we have incurred significant costs in connection with pending litigation and with the special litigation committee proceedings. Any legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements\nwith each of our directors and certain of our officers, and our bylaws require us to indemnify each of our directors and officers. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we have been and may continue to be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional discussion of these matters, refer to Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Footnote 19. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMatters relating to or arising from the restatement and the Audit Committee\u2019s investigation, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year 2017, our selected financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. As a result, such restatements and other findings of the Audit Committee following the internal investigation, we have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the restatement and adjustment of our financial statements, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from our customers or others with whom we do business. Concerns include the perception of the effort required to address our accounting and control environment and the ability for us to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, as a result of the restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement. If litigation did occur, we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of their outcome. Likewise, such events might cause a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nTrading in our securities has been suspended by, and may be delisted from, Nasdaq, and we cannot assure you that the suspension will be lifted, or that, if our securities are delisted, that they will be relisted.\nAs a result of the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC, we failed to comply with the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). As a result, a Nasdaq Hearings Panel determined to delist our securities and suspended the trading of our securities on Nasdaq effective September 26, 2019. Pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules, we intend to request that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council (the \u201cReview Council\u201d) review the determination of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to delist our securities. There can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful or if we will be able to relist our securities on Nasdaq. If our securities are delisted and we are unable to relist our securities, or in the event that our securities would be relisted or the trading suspension lifted by the Review Council, no assurance can be provided that an active trading market will develop or, if one develops, will continue.\nThe suspension or ultimate delisting of our securities from Nasdaq, could have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, reducing:\nThe liquidity of our common stock\u037e\nThe market price of our common stock;\nThe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common stock;\nThe number of market makers in our common stock;\nThe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock;\nThe number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock;\nOur ability to obtain equity financing for the continuation of our operations;\nOur ability to use our equity as consideration in any acquisition; and\nThe effectiveness of equity-based compensation plans for our employees used to attract and retain individuals important to our operations.\nUpon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to distribute the liquidation preference then due to the holders of our series A Preferred Stock which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that upon a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets or upon the disposition of more than 50% of our voting power, the holders of at least 60% of the preferred stock may elect to have such transaction treated as a liquidation and be entitled to receive their liquidation preference. Upon our liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock which, as of June 30, 2019 was approximately $20 million.\nDirector and officer liability is limited.\nAs permitted by Pennsylvania law, our by-laws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our by-law provisions and Pennsylvania law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our by-laws and indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with each of the officers and directors provide that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly for any reason, including the recent suspension of trading in our securities or a potential delisting of our securities by Nasdaq, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that, in some future period, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 91910, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "USAT"}
