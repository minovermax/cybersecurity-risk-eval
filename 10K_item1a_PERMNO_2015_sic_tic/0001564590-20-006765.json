These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks related to our business\nGlobal market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on our clients\u2019 businesses, may adversely affect us.\nIn general, demand for our products and services is highly correlated with general economic conditions. Because a significant part of our business relies on our clients\u2019 advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and customer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook may further reduce the demand for printing and related services that we provide to these clients. Delays or reductions in clients\u2019 spending could have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased revenue, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. In addition, client difficulties may result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.\nChanges in customer preferences have reduced, and may continue to reduce, demand for our products and services in certain markets. In addition, failure to manage changes in our relationships with our significant clients may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMany of the end markets in which our clients compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in customer preferences. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of clients. If we are unable to continue to utilize new and existing technologies to adapt to new distribution methods and address changing customer preferences, our business may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments and changing demands of clients may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies. We must monitor changes in our clients\u2019 markets and develop new solutions to meet clients\u2019 needs. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by clients. If we are unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, clients\u2019 demand for our products and services may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, electronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents. Customers continue to accept electronic substitution in statement printing and forms while online and digital advertising is impacting clients\u2019 printed advertising spend. The extent to which customers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has adversely affected our products, such as forms and statement printing. To the extent that customers, clients and regulators continue to accept these alternatives, demand for our products and services may be further adversely affected.\nDuring 2019, our five largest clients accounted for 9.5% of our net sales in the aggregate. There can be no assurance that our clients will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of or disruptions related to significant clients may result in a reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to significant clients. This may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, disputes with significant suppliers, including those related to pricing or performance, may adversely affect our ability to supply products to our clients and also our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon brand reputation and the quality of our client support and services offerings. If we fail to offer effective client support and services, our brand reputation could be harmed and clients may not use our products and services, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA high level of client support and service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions and the maintenance and enhancement of our brand reputation. If we are unable to provide a level of client support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our clients, we may experience a loss of clients and market share and a decline in our brand reputation which may result in reduced client demand for our products and services. Furthermore, our brand reputation may be impacted by a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including actions of our competitors and third party providers and positive or negative publicity, any or all of which could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are subject to political and regulatory risks in the countries in which we operate.\nOur operations may be substantially affected by both domestic and international political or regulatory risk including general political conditions in the countries in which we operate; unexpected legal, regulatory or tax changes; governmental actions which have the effect of restriction on our business or opportunities or make it more expensive for us to operate in those jurisdictions; and changes in tax laws that would reduce net income due to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions.\nIn addition, potential political uncertainty in our developed markets, or the perception of such uncertainty, has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. This may reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks associated with our domestic and international operations.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based global company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and represents the most significant change to U.S. tax law since 1986. During 2017, we recorded provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Act, and during the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our accounting analysis for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. However, in the future, we may be subject to additional taxes as required under the Tax Act, based upon new regulations and guidance which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nMany countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAdverse financial market conditions, our operating performance and our creditworthiness may limit our ability to obtain future financing and the cost of any such capital may be higher than in past periods.\nWe have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial institutions to fail, lenders to reduce lending or investors to reinvest in assets that are considered less risky. The failure of a financial institution that is a lender under our existing senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d) would reduce its size unless another financial institution was willing to replace such commitments. Future capital markets transactions are dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future financing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.\nOur current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our financing costs may further increase and our ability to obtain financing may be limited. If adequate capital is not available to us on reasonable terms and our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, or if future financings require more restrictive covenants, such combination of events could adversely affect our ability to (i) acquire new businesses or enter new markets, (ii) service or refinance our existing debt, (iii) pay dividends on common stock, (iv) make necessary capital investments, and (v) make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of our business.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement limits our borrowing capacity to the value of certain of our assets. In addition, our obligations under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material domestic subsidiaries and lenders may exercise remedies against the collateral if an event of default occurs.\nOur borrowing capacity under our ABL Credit Agreement is equal to the lesser of (i) $800.0 million and (ii) a borrowing base formula based on the amount of accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, equipment and, if we were to so elect in the future subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, fee-owned real estate of the Company and our material domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain eligibility criteria and advance rates (collectively, the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d). In the event of any material decrease in the amount of or appraised value of the assets in the Borrowing Base, our borrowing capacity would similarly decrease, which could adversely affect our business and liquidity.\nIf an event of a default occurs under our ABL Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement (collectively, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d), the lenders\u2019 commitment to extend further credit under our ABL Credit Agreement could be terminated, our outstanding obligations under either or both of the Credit Agreements could become immediately due and payable, outstanding letters of credit issued under our ABL Credit Agreement may be required to be cash collateralized, and remedies may be exercised against the collateral securing either or both of the Credit Agreements. If we are unable to borrow under our ABL Credit Agreement, we may not have the necessary cash resources to fund our operations or to meet scheduled repayments of other outstanding indebtedness and, if any event of default occurs under either Credit Agreement, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations, refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cash collateralize our letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Agreement, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nRestrictive covenants in our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement contain various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Certain restrictions on operations become applicable if our borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Agreement falls below certain thresholds. These restrictions could impose significant operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business.\nAn increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreements bear interest at rates that are calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or a base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin which, in the case of the ABL Credit Agreement, is dependent on the average quarterly borrowing availability under our ABL Credit Agreement. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, including if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate. We may utilize derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage our interest rate risk. There can be no assurance, however, that increases in interest rates will not adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense. Significantly higher interest rates may also, among other things, reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, as well as negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nIn July 2017 the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, but the potential phase out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption, which could adversely affect our current or future floating rate debt obligations, including obligations under our ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, our current or future derivative financial instruments that utilize LIBOR, and our overall cost of funding.\nWe may not be able to reduce or extinguish our material indebtedness, and as a result we may have increased financial leverage, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and our interest and principal payments are significant. In addition, our Term Loan Credit Agreement requires us to make quarterly principal payments and to make prepayments with excess cash flow and asset sale proceeds in certain circumstances. If we are unable to reduce this indebtedness, we will continue to have increased financial leverage, which may limit or restrict our ability to operate our business. In addition, our ability to make payments on, repay or refinance, such debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials or by fluctuations in the costs of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support our operations. As such, purchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase our costs and we may not be able to pass these costs on to clients through higher prices. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely affect clients\u2019 demand for our printing and related services. Other unforeseen developments in these markets may result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology.\nA decline in our Company\u2019s or our individual reporting units\u2019 expected profitability may result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.\nDuring 2019 and in prior years we have recorded significant goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments and continue to hold goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability may call into question the recoverability of our remaining goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write down or write off of these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such events have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur services depend on the reliability of computer systems we and our vendors maintain. If our systems fail or are unreliable, our operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage and power outages and a range of other hardware, software and network problems, as well as human error, employee misconduct, hacking and cybercrime. We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions. If a disruption occurs, we may incur losses and costs for interruption of our operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may suffer a material data breach of sensitive information. If our efforts to protect the security of such information are unsuccessful, any such material failures may result in significant costs to investigate and remediate the data-breach, private litigation expense and costly government enforcement actions and penalties, and may have an adverse effect on our operations and reputation.\nMaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and our clients and users who rely on us to protect the confidentiality of certain information they provide us. Many of our clients\u2019 industries are highly regulated and have established standards and requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers. Confidential and sensitive information stored in our systems are susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency. Disclosure of the information maintained on our systems due to human error, breach of our systems through hacking or cybercrime, a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or other such events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action and cause significant reputational harm for our clients, all of which may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in terms of sophistication, we may invest additional resources in the security of our systems. The level of investment could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe highly competitive market for our products and industry consolidation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe markets for the majority of our product categories are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors. We believe excess capacity in our markets has caused downward price pressure and this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which we compete may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices.\nWe believe that selectively pursuing acquisitions is an important strategy for us. If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another or otherwise consolidate, the competitive landscape would be significantly altered. Such consolidation would create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and, if we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the resulting increase in competitive pressures may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe have in the past acquired, and intend in the future to acquire, other businesses, and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of our key personnel or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt our operations or the operations of the acquired businesses. Our strategy is, in part, predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, we may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees and retirees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to employees and retirees. Costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits may increase, adversely affecting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. may also increase our cost of providing such benefits.\nChanges in market conditions or lower returns on assets may increase required pension and OPEB plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension and OPEB plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. Market conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which may partially mitigate or worsen the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse market conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension and OPEB plans may substantially increase in future periods, adversely impacting our financial condition.\nWe may be more vulnerable to adverse events and trends associated with operations outside the U.S.\nWe have significant operations outside the U.S. Conducting business outside the U.S. subjects us to a number of additional risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nperiodic changes in a specific country's or region's economic conditions, such as recession;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations (including those of municipalities or provinces where we have operations) and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, social insurance contributions and other payroll taxes and fees to governmental entities, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign clients where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses;\n\u2022\ncertification requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those resulting from inflation and currency devaluation activities;\n\u2022\ninadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\neffects of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and related potential disruption to trade;\n\u2022\npotential political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts, terrorism and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in the countries in which we and our clients, suppliers and contract manufacturers are located;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas and cultures, including assuring compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U. S. and foreign anticorruption laws; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.\nThese factors, individually or in combination, may impair our ability to effectively deliver our products and services, result in unexpected expenses, or cause an unexpected decline in the demand for our products in certain countries or regions. Specifically with respect to our operations in China, our financial performance may be adversely impacted as a result of the following risks, among others, regulation of foreign investment and business activities by the Chinese government, including scrutiny of foreign companies, may limit our ability to expand our business in China; uncertainties with respect to the legal system in China may limit the legal protections available to us in China; government restrictions on the remittance of currency out of China and the ability of any subsidiary we may establish in China to pay dividends and make other distributions to us; unfavorable result of ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China; and potential unfavorable tax and tariff consequences as a result of our operations in China.\nFurther, our business could be adversely affected by the recent outbreak of the respiratory illness caused by COVID-19, which was first identified in Wuhan, China. This situation is evolving and any further significant spread of this virus may have a material and adverse effect on our business and may include temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and clients, restrictions on our ability to distribute and sell our products, and other disruptions caused to us, our suppliers or clients as a result of this virus. This may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations based on our global operations. Although the results in our Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, we also earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in various foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We may enter into derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain exposures to exchange rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls, which may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls.\nCatastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our clients, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature may also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities would affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in rules and regulations to which we are subject may increase our costs, which may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to numerous rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, product safety, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations. These rules and regulations may be changed by local, state or federal governments in countries in which we operate. Changes in these regulations may result in a significant increase in our costs to comply. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations may require increases to our workforce, increased cost for compensation and benefits, or investments in new or upgraded equipment. In addition, growing concerns about climate change, including the impact of global warming, may result in new regulations, including with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation. Compliance with new rules and regulations or changes in existing rules and regulations, as well as the need to address any violations thereof, may result in additional costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMany of our clients are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications, governing the form of such communications and protecting the privacy of customers. For instance, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to such regulations. Changes in these regulations may impact clients\u2019 business practices and may reduce demand for our products and services. Changes in such regulations may eliminate the need for certain types of communications altogether or may impact the quantity or format of such communications.\nChanges in postal rates, regulations and delivery structure may adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our clients\u2019 cost structure and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces and types of mailings that our clients mail. In accordance with the 2006 PAEA, the PRC adjusted and approved USPS filings for a CPI based average price increase of 1.5% to 1.9% depending on the major class of mail. The new prices took effect on January 26, 2020.\nAdditionally, as required on the 10-year anniversary of PAEA, the PRC initiated a comprehensive review of PAEA on December 20, 2016, to determine if the current system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products is still achieving the original objectives of the law. The PRC issued its findings on December 1, 2017 and concluded that the current system was not meeting all of PAEA\u2019s original objectives. To remedy this situation, the PRC proposed recommendations, which among other things, allows the Postal Service pricing flexibility of \u201cCPI + 2%\u201d on market-dominant mail products for a 5-year period of time. The PRC asked for industry stakeholder input, comments and alternative suggestions to these recommendations which were due by March 1, 2018. The industry reaction to the PRC\u2019s recommendations was overwhelmingly negative, which in turn caused the PRC to reconsider and issue an amended proposal on December 12, 2019, nearly 21 months later. Industry stakeholders are expected to reply to the newest proposal by March 2020.\nIn other developments, the Trump administration on April 12, 2018 issued an Executive Order establishing a Task Force (\u201cTF\u201d) to evaluate the USPS. On December 4, 2018, the TF issued a formal report calling for a total reevaluation of the Postal Service business model to make the organization more viable and sustainable going into the future. No further action related to the TF report occurred in 2019.\nThe impact of any restructuring of the USPS, which may require legislative action, cannot currently be estimated. If implemented, certain changes may impact our clients\u2019 ability or willingness to communicate by mail. Declines in print volumes mailed would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased transportation costs and changes in the relationships with independent shipping companies may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely upon third party carriers for timely delivery of our product shipments. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and increased fuel costs. Any failure to deliver products to our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and may cause us to lose clients. If our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to ship products for us, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers for the shipment of products. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, if at all, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurthermore, shipping costs represent a significant operational expense for us. Changes in shipping terms, or the inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively (whether as a result of mechanical failure, casualty loss, labor stoppage, or any other reason), may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of these third-party carriers may have an adverse effect on our shipping costs. Any future increases in shipping rates may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, particularly if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our clients.\nUndetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that may seriously harm our business.\nOur products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platform are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential clients, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, client dissatisfaction and reductions in net sales and margins, any of which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain skilled personnel, particularly during strong economic periods, may have an adverse effect on us. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. Many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than we offer. In addition, many members of our management team have significant industry experience that is valuable to our competitors. We enter into non-solicitation and, as appropriate, non-competition agreements with certain of our executive officers, prohibiting them contractually from soliciting our clients and employees and from leaving and joining a competitor within a specified period. Our inability to hire and retain talented employees or the loss of senior members of our senior management team may result in challenges or temporary difficulty in managing our business, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may be contingently liable for various LSC Communications, Inc. and Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. operating leases.\nSubsequent to the spinoff of LSC Communications, Inc. (\u201cLSC\u201d) and Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. (\u201cDonnelley Financial\u201d), we may be contingently liable for obligations under various operating leases for office, warehouse and manufacturing locations of LSC and Donnelley Financial. In the event that LSC or Donnelley Financial fail to make lease payments or fail to pay other obligations under these lease agreements, we may be required to satisfy those obligations to the lessor. Under various agreements executed at the time of the spinoff, LSC and Donnelley Financial agreed to fully indemnify us in the event that we would be required to make a payment on their behalf; however, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from LSC and Donnelley Financial will be sufficient to satisfy the full amount of any such contingent obligations. Our exposure to these potential contingent liabilities will decrease over time as LSC and Donnelley Financial pay monthly lease obligations and as the leases expire. As of December 31, 2019, these potential contingent obligations were approximately $78.8 million and $5.5 million for LSC and Donnelley Financial, respectively. If we are required to make payments pursuant to these arrangements, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe spinoff transactions of LSC and Donnelley Financial in October 2016 could result in significant tax liability.\nWe obtained an opinion from our outside legal counsel substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distributions in connection with the spinoff transactions qualify as tax-free distributions under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Additionally, we have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that certain limited aspects of the distributions will not prevent the distributions from satisfying certain requirements for tax-free treatment under the Code. The opinion and the private letter ruling rely on customary factual representations and assumptions, which if incorrect or inaccurate may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion and letter ruling.\nIf either or both of the distributions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the common stock of such spun-off entity in a taxable sale for its fair value. In that case, we expect that RRD stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of the spun-off entity\u2019s common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each holder\u2019s tax basis in its Company common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. We expect that the amount of any such taxes to RRD stockholders and us would be substantial if this were to occur.", "PERMNO": 38682, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "RRD"}
