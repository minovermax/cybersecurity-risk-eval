RISK FACTORS\nMuch of the information included in this annual report includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d. Such forward-looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions, or other future performance suggested herein. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.\nSuch estimates, projections or other \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution readers of this annual report that important factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d. In evaluating us, our business and any investment in our business, readers should carefully consider the following factors.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our company or future operations.\nNaked commenced operations in 2010. Since beginning operations, we have generated limited total revenues. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our revenues were $557,212 (2014: $639,107). As a relatively new company, we are subject to many risks associated with the initial organization, financing, expenditures and impediments inherent in a new business. We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow that may continue into the foreseeable future. If we fail to execute our strategy to achieve and maintain profitability in the future, investors could lose confidence in the value of our common stock, which could cause our stock price to decline and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Potential investors should evaluate an investment in our company in light of the obstacles that may be encountered by a start-up company in a competitive market.\nOur limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends, to an extent, on our international expansion efforts. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our undergarments by customers in these new international markets. Our failure to develop new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets will harm our business and results of operations.\nOur auditors\u2019 report on our January 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph regarding there being substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $21,078,265. We anticipate generating losses for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations in the future as a going concern, as highlighted by our auditors with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2015. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business.\nOur future operating capital depends on our revenues and ability to raise capital through equity investments. Future equity investments will be dilutive to existing shareholders and the terms of securities issued may be more favorable for new investors. Further, in obtaining further equity investments, we may incur substantial costs including investment banking fees, legal fees and accounting fees. Our business operations may fail if our actual cash requirements exceed our estimates and we are not able to obtain further financing. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in our company.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of the Naked brand. The Naked name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. We rely on social media as one of our marketing strategies to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources. Additionally, while we devote considerable efforts and resources to protecting our intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, particularly those in Canada and the United States, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability of consumer credit, levels of unemployment, tax rates and the cost of consumer credit. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. The current volatility in the United States economy in particular has resulted in an overall slowing in growth in the retail sector because of decreased consumer spending, which may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. These unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchase of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing product costs and decreasing selling prices.\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including intense competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices we charge for our products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, reduce our sales prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, operating results and cash flows.\nWe have a concentration of sales to key customers and any substantial reduction in sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn fiscal 2015 sales were heavily concentrated with Nordstrom, which accounted for 28% of our sales. In fiscal 2014, Nordstrom accounted for 37% of our sales and Holt Renfrew accounted for 12%. Nordstrom is currently of key importance to our business and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if this relationship ceased. Although we continue to receive increasing sales orders from these customers, neither Nordstrom nor Holt Renfrew have any ongoing purchase commitment agreement with us; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by one or more of these two customers, whether due to actions by our competitors, industry factors or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We may be unable to introduce new products in a timely manner. Our new products may not be accepted by our customers, or our competitors may introduce similar products in a more timely fashion. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to customers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could impair the strength and exclusivity of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships.\nThe fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nThe fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. Our products also include natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over them and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nWe do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on third-party suppliers. Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional suppliers of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term. We have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. Additionally, if defects in the manufacture of our products are not discovered until after such products are purchased by our customers, our customers could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our results of operations could suffer and our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and profitability.\nThe market for undergarments is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of undergarments, including large, diversified companies with substantial market share and strong worldwide brand recognition, such as Calvin Klein and Armani. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. In contrast to our \u201cgrassroots\u201d marketing approach, many of our competitors promote their brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we can by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network, as opposed to distribution through retail stores, wholesale or internet, and many of our competitors have substantial resources to devote toward increasing sales in such ways.\nAny material disruption of our information systems could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our e-commerce website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, system failures, viruses or other causes, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. If changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers.\nOur fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors.\nThe intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is therefore limited and we currently own no patents or exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe currently rely on trademarks, as well as confidentiality procedures, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States or Canada, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to retain existing personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to our customer and employee relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nBecause a significant portion of our sales are generated in Canada, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue in Canada, and changes in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar may have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar. The exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar has fallen in the last twelve months and our results of operations have suffered from the weakness in the Canadian dollar. If the Canadian dollar continues to weaken relative to the US dollar, our net loss could continue to be adversely affected. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.\nThe United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. Countries impose, modify and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business.\nRisk Related to our Stock and Public Reporting Requirements\nWhile we believe we have taken the steps necessary to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to successfully address or prevent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure and other requirements may be adversely affected.\nOur management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015 related to the (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment, and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines (iii) inadequate security and restricted access to computer systems, including insufficient disaster recovery plans and (iv) lack of a written whistle-blower policy (see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d). As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that, as of January 31, 2015, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe can give no assurances that the measures we take to remediate material weaknesses that we identified will be successful, or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nAny material weakness or other deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure obligations or cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, which could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, purchasers of our common stock may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 450,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 42,510,063 shares are issued and outstanding as of April 30, 2015. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our shareholders. Consequently, our shareholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nTrading on the OTCQB may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our shareholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace operated by the OTC Markets Group. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and such other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nThe exercise of outstanding options and warrants, as well as the conversion of convertible debt instruments, may have a dilutive effect on the price of our common stock.\nTo the extent that outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised and convertible debt instruments are converted into shares of our common stock, dilution to our shareholders will occur. Moreover, the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of the outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt instruments can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise terms provided by the outstanding options, warrants or convertible debt instruments. At April 30, 2015, the total dilutive securities outstanding, including options, warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments was approximately 237,278,000 shares.\nOur stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations which may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.", "PERMNO": 15905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "NAKD.1"}
