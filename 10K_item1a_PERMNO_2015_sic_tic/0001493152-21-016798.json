RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nTHE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND MAY AMPLIFY THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING OUR BUSINESS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected U.S. consumer shopping patterns and caused the health of the U.S. and world economy to deteriorate in Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2021, demand for consumer electronics products including home based entertainment and toys was strong and resulted in a reduction in end-of-season overstock returns from three major customers as compared to overstock returns in Fiscal 2020. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact on our business and our financial results. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected as a result of prolonged disruptions in consumer spending, a lack of demand for our products, forced retail store closures and other factors that we cannot foresee. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOUR SUPPLY CHAIN MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.\nWe rely upon the facilities of our third-party manufacturers in China to manufacture our products and export our products throughout the world. The pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, including, among others, restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of China during Fiscal 2021. Currently, the increased demand for consumer electronics products and current economic recovery has continued to increase worldwide demand for products using semiconductor \u201cchip\u201d components in the production of most consumer electronics which has resulted in an international shortage of chips available to fulfill demand. As a result, we have experienced longer delivery lead times and some unavailability of these components which have delayed delivery of some of our products. We have also experienced delays in delivery schedules due new outbreaks of COVID-19 in Southern China that have forced temporary closures of some key shipping ports. The port closures have also led to a temporary shortage of shipping containers which have resulted in significant price increases due to increased demand. While we believe that most of these issues are temporary, if the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively controlled, our third-party manufacturers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. If our third-party manufacturers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate manufacturing sources, which may be more expensive and cause significant delays in procurement. At the current moment, restrictions have been eased and our third-party manufacturers in China are able to operate normally, however we are unable to predict future supply chain disruptions should the pandemic continue. If the pandemic continues uncontrolled, the impact on our supply chain in China may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we currently distribute 52% of our products from our warehouse facility in Ontario California and approximately 48% of our products are shipped direct import. An outbreak of COVID-19 infections among our warehouse staff or workers in the Port of Los Angeles or ports in China could close the warehouse or shipping ports, resulting in loss of sales. The COVID-19 outbreak could also delay our release or delivery of new or product offerings or require us to make unexpected changes to such offerings, which may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL TARIFFS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES, PRODUCT COST AND PROFITABILITY.\nU.S. government administration and members of the U.S. Congress have made public statements indicating possible significant changes in U.S. trade policy and have taken certain actions that may impact U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars,\u201d in increased costs for goods imported into the United States. All of our products are manufactured and imported from China however, only our microphone products are currently subject to 7.5% tariffs currently in place. Should the government decide to expand its list of products to include our karaoke products that would subject our products to tariffs in the future, there could be a significant increase in the landed cost of our products. If we are unable to mitigate these increased costs through price increases we could experience reductions in revenues, gross profit margin and results from operations.\nA SMALL NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE KEY CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND CASH FLOW.\nWe rely on a few large customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues. As a percentage of net sales, our sales to our three largest customers during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 69% and 64%, respectively. We do not have long-term contractual arrangements with any of our customers and they can cancel their orders at any time prior to delivery. A substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of our largest customers would decrease our revenues and cash flow.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT SOME OF OUR LARGE CUSTOMERS MAY RETURN KARAOKE PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE PURCHASED FROM US AND IF THIS HAPPENS, IT WOULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, a number of our customers and distributors returned karaoke products that they had purchased from us. Our customers returned goods valued at approximately $4.1 million or 9.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and approximately $5.4 million or 14.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. The return of products is due to a variety of reasons including defective units, customers\u2019 overstock and buyer\u2019s remorse. The primary reason for the 5.0 percentage point decrease in returns was primarily due to one-time overstock returns of licensed goods from one major customer and significant overstock returns of non-licensed products from three other major customers in fiscal 2020 and not repeated in fiscal 2021. Our factories charge customary repair and freight costs which increase our expenses and reduce profitability. If any of our customers were to increase the volume of their returned karaoke products to us, it would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PRESSURE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS RELATING TO PRICE REDUCTION AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND IF WE ARE PRESSURED TO MAKE THESE CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT WILL REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nBecause there is intense competition in the karaoke industry, we are subject to pricing pressure from our customers. Many of our customers have demanded that we lower our prices, or they will buy our competitor\u2019s products. If we do not meet our customer\u2019s demands for lower prices, we will not sell as many karaoke products. We are also subject to pressure from our customers regarding certain financial incentives, such as return credits or large cooperative (\u201cco-op\u201d) promotion incentives, which effectively reduce our net sales and profit. We gave co-op promotion incentives of approximately $2.0 million during fiscal 2021 and $2.9 million during fiscal 2020. We have historically offered co-op promotion incentives to our customers because it is standard practice in the retail industry.\nWE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY FORECASTING THE DEMAND FOR OUR KARAOKE PRODUCTS AND IF WE DO NOT ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND, OUR REVENUES, NET INCOME AND CASH FLOW MAY BE AFFECTED.\nBecause of our reliance on manufacturers in China for our machine production, our production lead times range from one to four months. Therefore, we must commit to production in advance of customers\u2019 orders. It is difficult to forecast customer demand because we do not have any scientific or quantitative method to predict this demand. Our forecasting is based on management\u2019s general expectations about customer demand, the general strength of the retail market and management\u2019s historical experiences. In past years we have overestimated demand for our products which led to excess inventory in some of our products and caused liquidity problems that adversely affected our revenues, net income and cash flow.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO THE COSTS AND RISKS OF CARRYING INVENTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND IF WE HAVE TOO MUCH INVENTORY, IT WILL AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW FOR OPERATIONS.\nMany of our customers place orders with us several months prior to the holiday season, but they schedule delivery two or three weeks before the holiday season begins. As such, we are subject to the risks and costs of carrying inventory during the time period between the placement of the order and the delivery date, which reduces our cash flow. As of March 31, 2021 we had approximately $5.5 million in inventory. It is important that we sell this inventory during fiscal 2022, so we have sufficient cash flow for operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE RISK OF LOSS FOR GOODS DAMAGED WHILE IN TRANSIT FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE CUSTOMER AND OUR WAREHOUSE.\nAll of our goods are manufactured in China and are transported to customers and our warehouse in California via ocean vessel. As such, we are subject to damages that may occur to these goods when they are in transit to customers or our warehouse. Should substantial damage incur while goods are in transit we could experience a significant loss of revenue, inventory and incur significant out of pocket expenses associated with destruction of the damaged goods which could cause a significant loss from operations and reduction in cash flow. In August 2019, a major customer received goods that were significantly water damaged due to excess moisture absorbed in pallets shipped by the factory. As a result we incurred a loss of approximately $2.4 million during Fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021 we recovered approximately $2.3 million from our cargo insurance coverage and secured vendor invoice credits of $0.4 million from the factory that caused the damage. While we have taken measures to prevent a similar incident in the future there can be no guarantee that this type of damage or other types of damage could occur in the future. Unfortunately, due the size of the claim, we can no longer obtain insurance coverage for goods that are shipped direct import to our customers whose shipping terms are FOB shipping point however we have obtained insurance for goods in transit to our California warehouse.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AND THEREFORE OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR SALES DURING THE RELATIVELY BRIEF HOLIDAY SEASON.\nSales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season, which includes Christmas. A substantial majority of our sales occur during the second quarter ending September 30 and the third quarter ending December 31. Sales in our second and third quarter, combined, accounted for approximately 86% and 85% of net sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE IN THE KARAOKE PRODUCTS CATEGORY, OUR REVENUES AND NET PROFITABILITY WILL BE REDUCED.\nOur major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are Singsation\u00ae, Singtrix\u00ae, eKids\u00ae, Bonaok, Karaoke USA\u2122, Ion\u00ae Audio, licensed property karaoke products and other consumer electronics companies. We believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price, product features, reputation, delivery times, and customer support. To the extent that we lower prices to attempt to enhance or retain market share, we may adversely impact our operating margins. Conversely, if we opt not to match competitor\u2019s price reductions we may lose market share, resulting in decreased volume and revenue. To the extent our leading competitors reduce prices on their karaoke machines, we must remain flexible to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce our prices, it will result in lower margins and reduced profitability. Because of intense competition in the karaoke industry in the United States during fiscal 2021, we expect that the intense pricing pressure in the low end of the market will continue in the karaoke market in the United States in fiscal 2022. In addition, we must compete with all the other existing forms of entertainment including, but not limited to: motion pictures, video arcade games, home video games, theme parks, nightclubs, television, prerecorded tapes, CD\u2019s, and DVD\u2019s and streaming video.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW KARAOKE PRODUCTS, OUR REVENUES MAY NOT CONTINUE TO GROW.\nThe karaoke industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and ongoing customer demands for greater performance. In addition, the average selling price of any karaoke machine has historically decreased over its life, and we expect that trend to continue. As a result, our products may not be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet evolving customer demands. The development of new products is complex, and we may not be able to complete development in a timely manner. To introduce products on a timely basis, we must:\n\u25cf accurately define and design new products to meet market demand;\n\u25cf design features that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf transition our products to new manufacturing process technologies;\n\u25cf identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;\n\u25cf anticipate changes in end-user preferences with respect to our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices; and\n\u25cf respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others.\nWe believe that we will need to continue to enhance our karaoke machines and develop new machines to keep pace with competitive and technological developments and to achieve market acceptance for our products. At the same time, we need to identify and develop other products which may be different from karaoke machines.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED FROM CHINA AND ANY DISRUPTION OF SHIPPING COULD PREVENT OR DELAY OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 RECEIPT OF INVENTORY.\nWe rely principally on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our warehouse facility in Ontario, California. Retailers that take delivery of our products in China rely on a variety of carriers to import those products. Any disruptions in shipping, whether in California or China, caused by labor strikes, other labor disputes, terrorism, and international incidents may prevent or delay our customers\u2019 receipt of inventory. If our customers do not receive their inventory on a timely basis, they may cancel their orders or return products to us. Consequently, our revenues and net income would be reduced and our results of operations adversely affected.\nOUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, SUBJECTING US TO RISKS COMMON IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, OUR REVENUES AND NET PROFITABILITY MAY BE REDUCED.\nWe are using five factories in the People\u2019s Republic of China to manufacture the majority of our karaoke machines. These factories will be producing all of our karaoke products in fiscal 2022. Our arrangements with these factories are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, such as import duties, trade restrictions, work stoppages, and foreign currency fluctuations, limitations on the repatriation of earnings and political instability, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we have limited control over the manufacturing processes. As a result, any difficulties encountered by our third-party manufacturers that result in product defects, production delays, cost overruns or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow. Also, since we do not have written agreements with any of these factories, we are subject to additional uncertainty if the factories do not deliver products to us on a timely basis.\nWE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS FOR PARTS FOR OUR KARAOKE MACHINES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN SUPPLIES AS NEEDED, OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY DAMAGED.\nOur growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of karaoke machines and our electronic products. We rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials we use to manufacture and produce these products. If our suppliers are unable to provide our factories with the parts and supplies, we will be unable to produce our products. Currently there is a worldwide shortage of electronic chips due to the increased demand for semiconductors and we are currently competing with large companies to obtain these parts and could see production and shipment delays. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion. If we are unable to anticipate any shortages of parts and materials in the future, we may experience severe production problems and delivery delays, which would impact our sales.\nCONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MAY AFFECT KARAOKE PURCHASES AND IS AFFECTED BY VARIOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGES.\nOur business and financial performance may be damaged more than most companies by adverse financial conditions affecting our business or by a general weakening of the economy. Purchases of karaoke machines and music are considered discretionary for consumers. Our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary and consumer spending, such as employment levels, business, interest rates, and taxation rates, all of which are not under our control. Additionally, other extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or military engagements, which adversely affect the retail environment may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our sales growth and profitability.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND IF THESE CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO PAY US, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY WILL BE REDUCED.\nWe sell products to retailers, including national chains, warehouse clubs, department stores, lifestyle merchants, specialty stores, and direct mail catalogs and showrooms. Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers could result in bad debt expense to us and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and future profitability. As of the filing date of this document we are not aware of any customers that are operating under the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nA DISRUPTION IN THE OPERATION OF OUR WAREHOUSE CENTER IN CALIFORNIA COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nA significant amount of our merchandise is shipped to our customers from our warehouse located in Ontario, California. Events such as fire or other catastrophic events, any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our customers, which could substantially decrease our revenues and profitability.\nCURRENT LEVELS OF SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL MARKET RISK.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, our financial condition and results of operations affected our ability to continue traditional financing with PNC Bank and PNC chose not to renew financing with the Company. The PNC Revolving Credit Facility was terminated on June 16, 2020. On June 16, 2020, the Company executed a tri-party Intercreditor Agreement for a Revolving Line of Credit (Intercreditor Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Company signed a two-year Loan and Security Agreement for a $10,000,000 (reduced to $5,000,000 during non-peak season) financing facility with Crestmark, a division of Meta Bank, NA (\u201cCrestmark\u201d) on eligible accounts receivable. Further, the Company also executed a two-year Loan and Security Agreement with Iron Horse Credit (\u201cIron Horse\u201d) for up to $2,500,000 in inventory financing. Should there be a disruption in the current levels of these markets or a deterioration of our business, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nThe majority of our products are currently manufactured in the People\u2019s Republic of China. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Chinese local currency had no material effect on the Company as all of our purchases are denominated in U.S. currency. However, in the event our purchases are required to be made in Chinese local currency, the Yuan, we will be subject to the risks involved in foreign exchange rates. In the future the value of the Yuan may depend to a large extent on the Chinese government\u2019s policies and China\u2019s domestic and international economic and political developments. As a result, our production costs may increase if we are required to make purchases using the Yuan instead of the U.S. dollar and the value of the Yuan increases over time. Any significant increase in the cost of manufacturing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We sell our product to Canadian customers some of whom require us to invoice them in Canadian Dollars. We are subject to risks involved in the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollar however, the exchange rate has been stable during fiscal 2021 and the associated exchange rates did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. Should the exchange rate between the Canadian and US Dollar become more volatile and sales to Canadian customers increase, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nINCREASED RAW MATERIAL/PRODUCTION PRICING\nFluctuation in the price of oil, electronic chip components and shipping costs have and will continue to affect the Company in connection with the sourcing and delivery of raw materials and services. We expect to see increased cost in our finished goods during fiscal year 2022 due to the significant increases in the price of oil, increased cost of trans-oceanic shipping, electronic component price increases and increases in the cost of labor related to regulations instituted in China which impact wages related to the cost of production. These issues are common to all companies in the same type of business and if the Company is not able to negotiate lower costs, reduce other expenses, or pass on some or all of these price increases to our customers, our profit margin may be decreased.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nIF OUR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED, OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS WILL SUFFER DILUTION.\nAs of March 31, 2021, there were outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,680,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.12 to $0.55 per share, not all of which are immediately exercisable. The weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is approximately $0.32 per share.\nFUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS AND INVESTORS MAY DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICE.\nAs of June 25, 2021 there were 39,040,748 shares of our common stock outstanding. We have filed two registration statements registering an aggregate 3,794,250 of shares of our common stock (a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the sale of 1,844,250 shares underlying options granted under our 1994 Stock Option Plan and a registration statement on Form S-8 to register 1,950,000 shares of our common stock underlying options granted under our Year 2001 Stock Option Plan). The market price of our common stock could drop due to the sale of large number of shares of our common stock, such as the shares sold pursuant to the registration statements or under Rule 144, or the perception that these sales could occur.\nOUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECREASE IF WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended in January 2006, authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 100,000 shares of Class A common stock and 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. As of July 13, 2021 we had no shares of preferred stock or Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding. As of July 13, 2021, we had 39,060,748 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of 1,660,000 shares issuable under our outstanding stock options. As such, our Board of Directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 59,279,252 shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of common stock, whether by us to new shareholders or the exercise of outstanding options, may result in a reduction of the book value or market price per share of our outstanding common stock. Issuance of additional shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our then existing shareholders.\nPROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE OUR COMPANY AND COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions of our certificate of incorporation include: authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock, limiting the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders, and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nWE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH, IF NOT REMEDIATED, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND ACCURATELY REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the audit of our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements, we identified a deficiency, which we consider to be \u201cmaterial weaknesses,\u201d which, could reasonably result in a material misstatement in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u25cb our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cb operating results below expectations;\n\u25cb loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cb industry developments;\n\u25cb economic and other external factors;\n\u25cb changes in government regulations Including tariffs; and\n\u25cb period-to-period fluctuations in its financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWE HAVE NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends on our stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 88937, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "SMDM"}
