{"cik": "1495479", "company": "Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. We operate in a competitive and dynamic environment and therefore it is not possible for us to predict the impact these or any other factors could have on us or the extent to which any one factor, or combination of factors, may adversely affect our results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur financial results depend significantly upon the success of our existing and new restaurants.\nFuture growth in revenues and profits will depend on our ability to grow sales and efficiently manage costs in our existing and new restaurants. As of December 27, 2015, we operated 51 BRAVO! restaurants and 65 BRIO restaurants, of which three BRAVO! restaurant and three BRIO restaurants were opened within the preceding twelve months. The results achieved by these restaurants may not be indicative of longer-term performance or the potential market acceptance of restaurants in other locations.\nIn particular, the success of our restaurants revolves principally around guest traffic and average check per guest. Significant factors that might adversely impact our guest traffic levels and average guest check include, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndeclining economic conditions, including housing market downturns, rising unemployment rates, lower disposable income and consumer confidence and other events or factors that adversely affect consumer spending in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nincreased competition (both in the upscale affordable dining segment and in other segments of the restaurant industry);\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nguests\u2019 budgeting constraints, which may cause them to not order certain high-margin items such as desserts and beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic);\n\u2022\nguests\u2019 failure to accept menu price increases that we may make to offset increases in key operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour reputation and consumer perception of our concepts\u2019 offerings in terms of quality, price, value and service; and\n\u2022\nguest experiences from dining in our restaurants.\nOur restaurants are also susceptible to increases in certain key operating expenses that are either wholly or partially beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nfood and other raw materials costs, many of which we may not or cannot effectively hedge;\n\u2022\nlabor costs, including wage, workers\u2019 compensation, health care and other benefits expenses;\n\u2022\nrent expenses and other costs under leases for our new and existing restaurants;\n\u2022\nenergy, water and other utility costs;\n\u2022\ncosts for insurance (including property, liability and workers\u2019 compensation);\n\u2022\ninformation technology and other logistical costs; and\n\u2022\nexpenses due to litigation against us.\nThe failure of our existing or new restaurants to perform as expected could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our financial condition and results of operations depend in part on the success of our franchisee. However, our franchisee is an independent operator and we cannot control many factors that could impact the profitability of its restaurant. Risks relating to our limited control over franchisees may increase in the future if we enter into additional franchise arrangements.\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully develop and expand our operations.\nWe intend to develop new restaurants in our existing markets, and selectively enter into new markets. Since the start of 2011, we have expanded from 47 BRAVO! restaurants and 39 BRIO restaurants to 51 BRAVO! restaurants and 65 BRIO restaurants, as of December 27, 2015. The number and timing of new restaurants actually opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to operating growth, may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient funds from operations or to obtain favorable financing to support our development;\n\u2022\nidentification and availability of, and competition for, high quality locations that will continue to drive high levels of sales per unit;\n\u2022\nacceptable lease arrangements, including sufficient levels of tenant allowances and construction contributions;\n\u2022\nthe financial viability of our landlords, including the availability of financing for our landlords;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development cost management;\n\u2022\ntimely delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement of build-out construction activities;\n\u2022\ndelays due to the highly customized nature of our restaurant concepts and the complex design, construction and pre-opening processes for each new location;\n\u2022\nobtaining all necessary governmental licenses and permits on a timely basis to construct and operate our restaurants;\n\u2022\ncompetition in new markets, including competition for restaurant sites;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises;\n\u2022\nadverse weather during the construction period;\n\u2022\nunanticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants;\n\u2022\nrecruitment of qualified managers, chefs and other key operating personnel; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nWe may not be able to open our planned new restaurants on a timely basis, if at all, and, if opened, these restaurants may not be operated profitably. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, delays in restaurant openings from time to time. Such actions may limit our growth opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand or acquire critical market presence for our brands in new geographical markets, as we may encounter well-established competitors with substantially greater financial resources. We may be unable to find attractive locations, acquire name recognition, successfully market our brands or attract new guests. Competitive circumstances and consumer characteristics in new market segments and new geographical markets may differ substantially from those in the market segments and geographical markets in which we have substantial experience. If we are unable to expand in existing markets or penetrate new markets, our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may be harmed.\nChanges in economic conditions, including continuing effects from the recent recession, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, together with the rest of the restaurant industry, depend upon consumer discretionary spending. The recent recession impacted consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend discretionary dollars. Economic conditions may remain volatile and may repress consumer confidence and discretionary spending for the near term. Guest traffic could be adversely impacted if our guests choose to dine out less frequently or reduce the amount they spend on meals while dining out. Additionally, a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending could result in a decrease in the traffic of business travelers at our restaurants. If restaurant sales decrease, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of sales. Reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures have resulted and could result from prolonged negative restaurant sales. We closed one restaurant during 2015.\nDamage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brands in existing and new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built a strong reputation for the quality and breadth of our menu and our restaurants, and we must protect and grow the value of our BRAVO! and BRIO brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brands could significantly reduce their respective value and damage our business. If guests perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur corporate reputation or brand may also be harmed by actions taken by our franchisee that are otherwise out of our control. We cannot assure you that our franchisee will successfully participate in our strategic initiative or operate its restaurant in a manner consistent with our concept and standards. Our franchisee is an independent contractor, and its employees are not our employees. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, our franchisee, but the quality of its restaurant may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, our franchisee may not successfully operate its restaurant in a manner consistent with our high standards and requirements, and our franchisee may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Any operational shortcomings at our franchised BRIO restaurant will likely be attributed by consumers to our entire brand, thus damaging our corporate brand and reputation, potentially adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks described in this paragraph will increase in significance to our business if we enter into additional franchise arrangements in the future.\nA multi-location restaurant business such as ours can be adversely affected by negative publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, regarding food quality issues, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our restaurants, restaurants operated by other foodservice providers or others across the food industry supply chain. Negative publicity concerning E. coli bacteria relating to the consumption of beef and other meat products, \u201cH1N1\u201d or \u201cswine flu\u201d related to pork products, \u201cavian flu\u201d related to poultry products and the publication of government, academic or industry findings about health concerns relating to menu items served by our restaurants could affect consumer food preferences. The sale of food and prepared food products also involves the risk of injury or illness to our guests as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases. These types of health concerns and negative publicity concerning our food products may adversely affect the demand for our food and negatively impact our business and results of operations. While we have taken steps to mitigate food quality, public health and other foodservice-related risks, these types of health concerns or negative publicity cannot be completely eliminated or mitigated and may materially harm our results of operations and result in damage to our brands.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully develop new restaurants in new markets may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of our brands in these new markets. To the extent that we are unable to foster name recognition and affinity for our brands in new markets, our new restaurants may not perform as expected and our growth may be significantly delayed or impaired.\nBecause many of our restaurants are concentrated in local or regional areas, we are susceptible to economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in these areas.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on restaurants located in Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas, which comprise approximately 49% of our total restaurants. As a result, adverse economic conditions in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. In recent years, certain of these states have been more negatively impacted by the housing market decline, high unemployment rates and the overall economic crisis than other geographic areas. In addition, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, hurricanes, droughts or other natural or man-made disasters.\nIn particular, adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating, and, in more severe cases, cause temporary restaurant closures, sometimes for prolonged periods. Approximately 37% of our total restaurants are located in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey, which are particularly susceptible to snowfall, and 16% of our total restaurants are located in Florida and Louisiana, which are particularly susceptible to hurricanes. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with restaurant sales typically higher during certain months, such as December. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may exacerbate the effect of adverse weather on guest traffic and may cause fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter within a fiscal year. For example, Hurricane Sandy affected the entire eastern seaboard with extremely high winds, heavy rainfall and flooding in October 2012, which led to reduced guest traffic and even closures at some of our restaurants. In addition, outdoor patio seating is available at most of our restaurants and may be impacted by a number of weather-related\nfactors. Our inability to fully utilize our restaurants\u2019 seating capacity as planned may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and other retail center tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to the inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of developers and potential landlords.\nIn addition, several other tenants at retail centers in which we are located or where we have executed leases have ceased operations or, in some cases, have deferred openings or failed to open after committing to do so. These failures may lead to reduced guest traffic at retail centers in which our restaurants are located and may contribute to lower guest traffic at our restaurants.\nChanges in food availability and costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability and operating margins are dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs. We rely on local, regional and national distributors and suppliers to provide our produce, beef, poultry, seafood and other ingredients. We contract with DMA for the broadline distribution of most of our food products. Other than for a portion of our commodities, which are purchased locally by each restaurant, we rely on GFS, BEK, Shamrock, and Nicholas as the primary distributors of a majority of our ingredients. Through our agreement with DMA, we have a non-exclusive arrangement with both GFS, BEK, Shamrock, and Nicholas on terms and conditions that we believe are consistent with those made available to similarly situated restaurant companies. Although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available, any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by either GFS, BEK, Shamrock, and Nicholas could cause our food costs to increase. Additionally, we currently rely on sole suppliers for certain of our food products, including some of our soups and sauces. Failure to identify an alternate source of supply for these items may result in significant cost increases. Increases in distribution costs or sale prices could also cause our food costs to increase. In addition, any material interruptions in our supply chain, such as a material interruption of ingredient supply due to the failures of third-party distributors or suppliers, or interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, may result in significant cost increases and reduce sales. Changes in the price or availability of certain food products could affect our ability to offer a broad menu and price offering to guests and could materially adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nThe type, variety, quality and price of produce, beef, poultry and seafood are more volatile than other types of food and are subject to factors beyond our control, including weather, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Our food distributors or suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. Although we are able to contract for the majority of the food commodities used in our restaurants for periods of up to one year, the pricing and availability of some of the commodities used in our operations cannot be locked in for periods of longer than one week or at all. Currently, we have pricing agreements of varying lengths with several of our distributors and suppliers, including our distributors and suppliers of poultry, seafood, dairy products, soups and sauces, bakery items and certain meat products. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market fluctuations in the price of beef, seafood, produce and other food products at this time. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs through our purchasing practices and menu price adjustments in the future, and failure to do so could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nIncreases in our labor costs, including as a result of changes in government regulation, could slow our growth or harm our business.\nWe are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our labor costs are, as a percentage of revenues, higher than other industries, we may be significantly harmed by labor cost increases.\nWe retain the financial responsibility for risks and associated liabilities, up to a stop loss amount, with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employment practices and other insurable risks through our self insurance programs. Unfavorable fluctuations in market conditions, availability of such insurance or changes in state and/or federal regulations could significantly increase our self insurance costs and insurance premiums. In addition, we are subject to the risk of\nemployment-related litigation at both the state and federal levels, including claims styled as class action lawsuits which are more costly to defend. Also, some employment related claims in the area of wage and hour disputes are not insurable risks.\nDespite our efforts to control costs while still providing competitive health care benefits to our staff members, significant increases in health care costs continue to occur, and we can provide no assurance that our cost containment efforts in this area will be effective. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will be able to pass through the costs of such increases in a manner that will not adversely impact our operating results.\nIn addition, many of our restaurant personnel are hourly workers subject to various minimum wage requirements or changes to tip credits. Mandated increases in minimum wage levels and changes to the tip credit, which are the amounts an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when calculating the employee\u2019s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes, have recently been and continue to be proposed and implemented at both federal and state government levels. Minimum wage increases or changes to allowable tip credits may increase our labor costs or effective tax rate.\nAdditionally, potential changes in labor legislation could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence. Although we do not currently have any unionized employees, future labor legislation could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase costs and reduce our operating flexibility.\nLabor shortages could increase our labor costs significantly or restrict our growth plans.\nOur restaurants are highly dependent on qualified management and operating personnel, including regional management, general managers and executive chefs. Qualified individuals have historically been in short supply and an inability to attract and retain them would limit the success of our existing restaurants as well as our development of new restaurants. We can make no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain qualified individuals in the future. Additionally, the cost of attracting and retaining qualified individuals may be higher than we anticipate, and as a result, our profitability could decline.\nGuest traffic at our restaurants could be significantly affected by competition in the restaurant industry in general and, in particular, within the dining segments of the restaurant industry in which we compete.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to food quality, ambiance, service, price and value and location, and a substantial number of restaurant operations compete with us for guest traffic. The main competitors for our brands are other operators of mid-priced, full service concepts in the multi-location upscale affordable dining segment in which we compete most directly for real estate locations and guests, including Maggiano\u2019s, Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang\u2019s and BJ\u2019s Restaurants. We also compete to a lesser extent with nationally recognized casual dining Italian restaurants such as Romano\u2019s Macaroni Grill, Carrabba\u2019s Italian Grill and Olive Garden, as well as high quality, locally-owned and operated Italian restaurants. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well established in markets in which we have existing restaurants or intend to locate new restaurants. Any inability to successfully compete with the other restaurants in our markets will place downward pressure on our guest traffic and may prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability. We may also need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that develop from time to time, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that modifications to our concepts will not reduce our profitability. A recent trend in shopping malls and lifestyle centers has been to convert retail spaces into new restaurant locations further increasing competition for guests at a specific center. In addition, with improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants, quick-service restaurants and grocery stores and the influence of other factors, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives, which could also negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants.\nWe may be required to record additional asset impairment charges in the future.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We have determined that our asset group for impairment testing is comprised of the assets and liabilities of each of our individual restaurants, as this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances.\nIn determining the recoverability of the asset value, an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances. The other factors and circumstances include changes in the economic environment, changes in the manner in which assets are used, unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate, incurring excess costs in construction of the asset, overall restaurant operating performance and projections for financial performance. We regularly review any restaurant that is cash flow negative for the previous four quarters to determine if impairment testing is warranted. As part of the review we also take into account that our\nbusiness is highly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations, including the holiday season at the end of the fourth quarter as it significantly impacts our short and long term projections for each location. These estimates may result in a wide range of variability on a year to year basis due to the nature of the criteria. We evaluate future cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans. Our impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and operating outcomes, which are based upon a significant degree of management\u2019s judgment. Based on this analysis, if we believe the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized based upon the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d As a result of the above mentioned review process, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.2 million related to six restaurants in fiscal 2015. We did not recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2014 and recognized an impairment charge of $14.2 million related to five restaurants in fiscal 2013.\nLegislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or adverse opinions about the health effects of consuming our menu offerings, could affect consumer preferences and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGovernment regulation and consumer eating habits may impact our business as a result of changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming our menu offerings. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings. For example, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to guests, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Furthermore, the PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information upon request. The Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") is also permitted to require additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans-fat content. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.\nCertain provisions of the PPACA became effective upon enactment, while other provisions will require regulations to be promulgated by the FDA. It is expected that the FDA will not enforce the applicable provisions of the PPACA until these regulations are finalized. The PPACA specifically preempts conflicting state and local laws, and instead provides a single, national standard for nutrition labeling of restaurant menu items. However, until these provisions of the PPACA are fully adopted and effective, we will continue to be subject to a variety of state and local laws and regulations regarding nutritional content disclosure requirements, many of which are inconsistent or are interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another.\nCompliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. We cannot predict the impact of the new nutrition labeling requirements under the PPACA, once they are issued and implemented. Additionally, some government authorities are increasing regulations regarding trans-fats and sodium, which may require us to limit or eliminate trans-fats and sodium from our menu offerings and switch to higher cost ingredients and may hinder our ability to operate in certain markets.\nWe cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. While we believe that our ability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, we are concerned that the imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general.\nThe impact of new restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance.\nQuarterly results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings (often dictated by factors outside of our control), including associated pre-opening costs and operating inefficiencies, as well as changes in our geographic concentration due to the opening of new restaurants. We typically incur the most significant portion of pre-opening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding and the month of the opening of the restaurant. Our experience has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly\nopened restaurant for the first several months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our new restaurants commonly take several months to reach planned operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including the training of new personnel, lack of market awareness, inability to hire sufficient qualified staff and other factors. Accordingly, the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had, and may continue to have, a meaningful impact on our profitability. Due to the foregoing factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year, and these fluctuations may cause our operating results to be below expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nOur business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nThe success of our business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent in particular on our ability to retain and motivate Brian O'Malley, our President and Chief Executive Officer; James J. O\u2019Connor, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary; and Khanh Collins, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as certain other key personnel. We currently have employment agreements in place with Mr. O'Malley and Mr. O\u2019Connor. The loss of the services of our President and CEO, CFO, COO or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for future development. We have no reason to believe that we will lose the services of any of these individuals in the foreseeable future; however, we currently have no effective replacement for any of these individuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in our operations. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nOur growth may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could slow our development of new restaurants and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants.\nWe opened three BRAVO! and three BRIO restaurants in 2015, three BRAVO! and three BRIO restaurants in 2014, and one BRAVO! and seven BRIO restaurants in 2013. Our recent and future growth may strain our restaurant management systems and resources, financial controls and information systems. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or to manage other factors necessary for us to meet our expansion objectives, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if sales decline, we may be unable to reduce our infrastructure quickly enough to prevent sales deleveraging, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nRestaurant companies have been the target of class-actions and other litigation alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state law.\nIn recent years, a number of restaurant companies have been subject to claims by guests, employees and others regarding issues such as food safety, personal injury and premises liability, employment-related claims, harassment, discrimination, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted against us from time to time, including a 2012 class action lawsuit initiated by tipped employees at a BRAVO! location in Des Moines, Iowa. In this lawsuit, it was alleged that we were in violation of the Fair Standards Act for some of our employees at that location. While we settled this lawsuit for an immaterial amount and no other such lawsuits have had a material impact historically, an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our profitability and could cause variability in our results compared to expectations. We are self-insured, or carry insurance policies with specific retention levels, for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, employer\u2019s practice liability, directors' and officers' liability and other insurable risks. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, we could also be adversely affected by negative publicity, litigation costs resulting from the defense of these claims and the diversion of time and resources from our operations.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful.\nWe expend significant resources in our marketing efforts, including our loyalty programs, using a variety of media, including social media venues and applications. We expect to continue to conduct brand awareness programs and guest initiatives to attract and retain guests. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to purchase significantly more television and radio advertising than we are able to purchase. Should our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotions or our advertising funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and fluctuating insurance requirements and costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe believe our insurance coverage is customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. These losses, if they occur, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, general liability insurance, employer\u2019s practice liability insurance and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance fluctuates based on our historical trends, market conditions and availability. Additionally, health insurance costs in general have risen significantly over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase in 2016 and beyond. These increases, as well as recently-enacted federal legislation requiring employers to provide specified levels of health insurance to employees averaging greater than 30 hours per week, could have a negative impact on our profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications and cost control measures, additional operating efficiencies or the pass-through of such increased costs to our guests.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nOn November 5, 2014, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2014 Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 27, 2015, we had approximately $43.3 million of outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. As of December 27, 2015, we had $54.1 million of revolving loan availability under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $2.6 million of outstanding letters of credit). For the year ended December 27, 2015, our total borrowings, repayments on indebtedness and cash interest payments were $705.1 million, $717.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 28, 2014, our total borrowings, repayments on indebtedness and cash interest payments were $169.8 million, $129.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Our revolving credit facility matures in 2019, and borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at our option of either (i) the Base Rate (as such term is defined in the 2014 Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin of 0.50% to 1.50% or (ii) at a fixed rate for a period of one, two, three or six months equal to the London interbank offered rate, LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.50%.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it:\n\u2022\nrequires us to utilize a portion of our cash flow from operations for payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nmakes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAlthough our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.\nOur revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and leverage ratios, which become more restrictive over time. While we have never defaulted on compliance with any financial covenants under the terms of our indebtedness, our ability to comply with these ratios in the future may be affected by events beyond our control, and an inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our revolving credit facility. In the event of any default, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate lending commitments and declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.\nSee Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may be unable to obtain debt or other financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThere are inherent risks in our ability to borrow. Our lenders may have suffered losses related to their lending and other financial relationships, increased financial instability of many borrowers and the declining value of their assets. As a result, lenders may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards, which could make it more difficult for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility, refinance our existing indebtedness or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all. Our\nfinancial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if we were unable to draw funds under our revolving credit facility because of a lender default or to obtain other cost-effective financing.\nLonger term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures (including the opening of new restaurants) and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash.\nOpening new restaurants in existing markets may negatively affect sales at our existing restaurants.\nThe consumer target area of our restaurants varies by location, depending on a number of factors such as population density, local retail and business attractions, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new restaurant, whether using the same brand or a different brand, in or near markets in which we already have existing restaurants could adversely impact the sales of new or existing restaurants. We do not intend to open new restaurants that materially impact the existing sales of our existing restaurants. However, there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization between our restaurants will not occur or become more significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations.\nSecurity breaches of confidential guest information in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions may adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information as well as the personal information of their customers has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests\u2019 credit card or debit card. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos and the ambiance of our restaurants. We have registered a number of our trademarks. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our restaurants, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.\nIf our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be adversely affected. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our restaurants, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or rebrand our restaurants, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage to or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and\nupgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nA major natural or man-made disaster at our corporate facility could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our corporate systems, processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Ohio location with certain systems and processes being concurrently stored at an offsite storage facility in accordance with our disaster recovery plan. As part of our disaster recovery plan, we backup data and environments from our core systems to our co-location facility. Failures or delays in recovery of data, delayed reporting and compliance, inability to perform necessary corporate functions and other breakdowns in normal operating procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business and create exposure to administrative and other legal claims against us.\nWe have significant cost obligations as a result of being a public company.\nNew and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, have created uncertainty for public companies and increased our costs and time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While we are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for fiscal 2015, there is no guarantee that we will meet all areas of compliance in future years. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nFederal, state and local tax rules may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the IRS or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, complying with new tax rules, laws or regulations could impact our financial condition, and increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws, rules or regulations may increase our effective tax rate. Any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our financial results. In 2012, our 2010 federal tax return was audited by the IRS. While the audit is currently open, we do not believe that any adjustment as a result of the examination would be material to our financial statements; however, there is no guarantee that there will not be findings in this audit, future audits will not be conducted, or any findings recorded in a separate audit for another period.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\nThe price of our common shares may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common shares may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, which include:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in our senior management personnel;\n\u2022\nsales of common shares by our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe level and quality of research analyst coverage for our common shares, changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or failure to meet such estimates;\n\u2022\nthe financial disclosure we may provide to the public, any changes in such disclosure or our failure to meet such disclosure;\n\u2022\nvarious market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our distributors or suppliers or our competitors;\n\u2022\nintroductions of new offerings or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common shares;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets (including those resulting from Acts of God, war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events).\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The price of our common shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. If the market value of our common shares experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer.\nFuture sales of our common shares in the public market could lower our share price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market by our existing shareholders, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of shares of restricted stock or shares of stock granted in the future or by persons who acquire shares in the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Such sales could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 27, 2015, we had 20,293,296 common shares issued, and 5,534,308 treasury shares repurchased through the end of 2015. In addition, we have reserved 1.9 million common shares for issuance under the Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, of which 195,422 shares are subject to vesting under outstanding restricted stock awards and 1,283,664 shares remain eligible for future issuance. Stock options to purchase an aggregate of 790,731 common shares are currently vested and outstanding under the Bravo Development, Inc. Option Plan.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports, or do not publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nCertain provisions of Ohio law and our articles of incorporation and regulations may deter takeover attempts, which may limit the opportunity of our shareholders to sell their shares at a favorable price, and may make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our board of directors and management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and regulations may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholders proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\navailability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares;\n\u2022\nestablishment of a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nthe right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or due to the resignation or departure of an existing board member;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of shareholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Ohio, we are governed by the provisions of Section 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code. These provisions may prohibit large shareholders, particularly those owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our articles of incorporation and regulations and under Ohio law could discourage potential takeover attempts, could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for our common shares in the future and could potentially result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nAlthough no preferred shares were outstanding as of December 27, 2015 and although we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares, our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 preferred shares. The preferred shares may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which will be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by the shareholders. These terms may include voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred shares could diminish the rights of holders of our common shares and, therefore, could reduce the value of our common shares. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred shares could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred shares and the foregoing anti-takeover provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by a third party to acquire control of our company, even if some of our shareholders consider such change of control to be beneficial.\nSince we do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, investors may be forced to sell their shares in order to realize a return on their investment.\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on our common shares. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common shares for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common shareholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common shares. If we issue additional equity securities, existing shareholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interest.", "PERMNO": 12348, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BBRG"}
