{"cik": "45919", "company": "HARTE HANKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is severe, widespread, and continues to evolve and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Rises in infection rates across the globe have caused the re-institution of quarantines and lock-down procedures that were relaxed during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. While vaccines for the virus that causes COVID-19 have begun to be deployed in many countries throughout the world, the pandemic continues to cause significant volatility in the global economic markets and significant uncertainty remains as to the timing and pace of a global economic recovery. As a result, our operating results may be subject to fluctuations based on general economic conditions and the extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our business. While the pandemic and the resulting impact on the global economy have not material adversely affected our business to date, the deterioration of economic conditions could materially reduce our sales and profitability. Any financial distress of our customers due to the pandemic could result in reduced sales and decreased collectability of accounts receivable which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, the Company faces risks due to the evolving effect of COVID-19 on our employees, customers, suppliers, and third-party providers, including the impact of actions taken by the U.S. and foreign governments to curtail the spread of the virus, including social distancing measures and restrictions on travel and building capacity limits. In addition, if there was an outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our facilities, we may be required to temporarily close such facility.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our employees are working remotely, and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Further, the increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security, and fraud concerns.\nAlthough we have developed and continue to develop plans to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and safeguard all of our IT functions to ensure security and data protection, such efforts may not prevent our business from being materially adversely affected. Should the adverse impacts described above (or others that are currently unknown) occur, whether individually or collectively, we could experience declines in revenue and profitability. Such impacts could be material to our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2021 and subsequent reporting periods.\nAs the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our operations, key metrics, and financial performance depends on future developments, including the pace of production and deployment of a vaccine, that are uncertain and unpredictable, its impact on capital and financial markets, and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions, as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others, the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nMost of our client engagements are cancelable on short notice.\nThe marketing services we offer, in particular for contact center services, are generally terminable upon short notice by our clients, even if the term of the agreement (and the expected duration of services) is several or many years. Many of our customer agreements do not have minimum volume or revenue requirements or exclusivity arrangements, so clients may (and do) vary their actual orders from us over time based on their own business needs, their satisfaction with the quality and pricing of our services, and a variety of other competitive factors. In addition, the timing of particular jobs or types of jobs at particular times of year (such as mail programs supporting the holiday shopping season or contact center programs supporting a specific event) may cause significant fluctuations in the operating results of our operations in any given quarter. We depend to some extent on sales to certain industries, such as the consumer retail industries, technology, and financial services. Some participants in these industries have announced that the global outbreak of COVID-19 has affected and is expected to continue to affect operations and results for at least the near future.\nTo the extent these industries experience downturns, our clients may re-evaluate their marketing spend, which could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients. The loss of a client or significant work from one or more of our clients could adversely affect our business.\nOur largest client (measured in revenue) generated 11.2% of total revenues in 2020. Approximately 62% of our revenue for 2020 was generated by our 25 largest clients. While we typically have multiple projects with our largest customers which would not all terminate at the same time, the loss of one or more of our larger clients or the projects or contracts with one of our largest clients could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition if the lost revenues are not replaced with profitable revenues from that client or other clients.\nOur indebtedness may adversely impact our ability to react to changes in our business or changes in general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $27.1 million of indebtedness outstanding, $17.1 million of which was secured indebtedness. In addition, subject to compliance with the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness and the Certificate of Designation for our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time.\nOn April 17, 2017, we entered into a secured credit facility with Texas Capital Bank, N.A (\u201cTexas Capital Bank\u201d), that provided a $20.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cTexas Capital Credit Facility\u201d), and for letters of credit issued by Texas Capital Bank up to $5.0 million. The Texas Capital Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s and its material domestic subsidiaries\u2019 assets. The Texas Capital Credit Facility is guaranteed by HHS Guaranty, LLC, an entity formed to provide credit support for Harte Hanks by certain members of the Shelton family (descendants of one of our founders). On May 11, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the Texas Capital Credit Facility which further extended the maturity of the facility by one year to April 17, 2022 and decreased the borrowing capacity to $19.0 million.\nOn April 14, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note with Texas Capital Bank, for an unsecured loan with a principal amount of $10.0 million made to the Company pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP Term Note\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). The PPP Term Note is guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration.\nSee Note F, Long-Term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt.\nOur ability to incur indebtedness is also impacted by the terms of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which limits our ability to incur indebtedness without the holders\u2019 consent to the greater of $40 million or four times our trailing 12-month EBITDA (measured at the time such indebtedness is incurred). Any failure or inability to obtain new financing arrangements when needed on favorable terms could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity position.\nThe amount of our indebtedness and the terms under which we borrow money under any future credit facilities or other agreements could have significant consequences for our business. The instruments governing our borrowings may include covenants requiring that we maintain certain financial measures and ratios. Covenant and ratio requirements may limit the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations and capital needs. A failure to comply with these restrictions or to maintain the financial measures and ratios contained in the debt agreements could lead to an event of default that could result in an acceleration of indebtedness. In addition, the amount and terms of any future indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, including limiting our ability to invest in our strategic initiatives, and consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash flows that would otherwise be available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates, as discussed below under the Risk Factor \u201cInterest rate increases could affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\u201d\nRisks related to our receipt of Paycheck Protection Program funding.\nThe PPP Term Note application required us to certify, among other things, that the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time of the application, made the PPP Term Note request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith, the certification does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In early 2020, the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) provided guidance that it would be unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such company should be prepared to demonstrate to the Small Business Administration, upon request, the basis for its certification. Further, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Small Business Administration Administrator announced that the government will conduct a full audit of all PPP Term Notes of more than $2 million for which the borrower applies for forgiveness. While we believe we have satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Term Note, there is a risk that we may be deemed ineligible to have received the PPP Term Note or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Term Note. In the first quarter of 2021, we applied for the forgiveness of the PPP Term Note made on April 14, 2020, but if the SBA were to find we were initially ineligible to receive PPP Term Note, our request for forgiveness may be disallowed, we may be required to repay the PPP Term Note in their entirety and we could be subject to additional penalties.\nRisks related to our pension benefit plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nPension benefits represent significant financial obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $69.2 million of unfunded pension liabilities. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to our plans. We utilize the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions. Differences between actual pension expenses and liability amounts from these estimated expense and liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need to obtain additional funding to continue as a going concern; if we are unable to meet our needs for additional funding in the future, we will be required to limit, scale back, or cease operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern. Because we continue to experience net operating losses, our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain profitability or successfully raise sufficient additional capital as needed, through future financing, asset sales or other strategic arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when needed, or if available, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us. If adequate funds are unavailable when needed, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. We may be required to scale down or sell certain businesses or cease operations.\nWe face significant competition for individual projects, entire client relationships and advertising dollars in general.\nOur business faces significant competition within each of our vertical markets and for all of our offerings. We offer our marketing services within a dynamic business environment characterized by rapid technological change, high turnover of client personnel who make buying decisions, client consolidations, changing client needs and preferences, continual development of competing products and services, and an evolving competitive landscape. This competition comes from numerous local, national, and international direct marketing and advertising companies, and client internal resources, against whom we compete for individual projects, entire client relationships, and marketing expenditures by clients and prospective clients. We also compete against internet (social, mobile, web-based, and email), print, broadcast, and other forms of advertising for marketing and advertising dollars in general. In 2020, we saw the entrance of new competitors and the insourcing of capabilities among our clients. We also saw an increase in both traditional consulting firms and niche companies becoming players in the customer experience landscape. Additionally, the decrease in client budgets/investments in customer experience activities due to the global pandemic naturally increased competition.\nOur ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients\u2019 policies on or perceptions of conflicts of interest which may prevent us from performing similar services for competitors. Some of our clients have also sought to reduce the number of marketing vendors or use third-party procurement organizations, all of which increases pricing pressure, and may disadvantage us relative to our competitors. Our failure to improve our current processes or to develop new products and services could result in the loss of our clients to current or future competitors. In addition, failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect our growth and financial condition.\nCurrent and future competitors may have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, and they may sell competing services at lower prices or at lower profit margins, resulting in pressures on our prices and margins.\nThe size of our competitors varies widely across vertical markets and service lines. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources than we do in any one or more of our market segments, or overall. As a result, our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, methodologies, and changes in customer requirements, or may devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale, and support of innovative products and services. Moreover, new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share, revenue, or margins. Some of our competitors also may choose to sell products or services that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products or services that compete with ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data, technical superiority, a broader or deeper product or experience set, greater capital resources or economies of scale. Price reductions or pricing pressure by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to retain clients or obtain new customers on favorable terms. Competitive pricing pressures tend to increase in difficult or uncertain economic environments, due to reduced marketing expenditures of many of our clients and prospects, and the resulting impact on the competitive business environment for marketing service providers such as our company.\nWe must maintain technological competitiveness, continually improve our processes, and develop and introduce new services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe believe that our success depends on, among other things, maintaining technological competitiveness in our products, processing functionality, and software systems and services. Technology changes rapidly as makers of computer hardware, network systems, programming tools, computer and data architectures, operating systems, database technology, and mobile devices continually improve their offerings. Advances in information technology may result in changing client preferences for products and product delivery channels in our industry. The increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients require us to continually improve our processes and provide new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner (whether through development, license, or acquisition). We may be unable to successfully identify, develop, and bring new and enhanced services and products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner, such services and products may not be commercially successful, and services, products, and technologies developed by others may render our services and products noncompetitive or obsolete.\nOur success depends on our ability to consistently and effectively deliver our services to our clients.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements within the agreed upon time frame and budget. Depending on the needs of our clients, our engagements may require customization, integration, and coordination of a number of complex product and service offerings and execution across many facilities. Moreover, in some of our engagements, we rely on subcontractors and other third parties to provide some of the services to our clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services, that we will be able to easily suspend work with contractors that are not performing adequately, or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact our ability to provide our products and services, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate, and execute our client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from our clients and our reputation in the marketplace as well as our ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients and other customers may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.\nWe have recently experienced, and may experience in the future, reduced demand for our products and services due to the financial condition and marketing budgets of our clients and other factors that may impact the industry verticals that we serve.\nMarketing budgets are largely discretionary in nature, and as a consequence are easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses. Our customers have in the past, and may in the future, respond to their own financial constraints (whether caused by weak economic conditions, weak industry performance or client-specific issues) by reducing their marketing spend. Customers may also be slow to restore their marketing budgets to prior levels during an economic recovery and may respond similarly to adverse economic conditions in the future. Our revenues are dependent on national, regional, and international economies and business conditions. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a near-term uncertainly for the global economy. A long-lasting economic recession, regardless of the cause, or anemic recovery in the markets in which we operate could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, or operating results. Similarly, industry or company-specific factors may negatively impact our clients and prospective clients, and in turn result in reduced demand for our products and services, client insolvencies, collection difficulties or bankruptcy preference actions related to payments received from our clients. We may also experience reduced demand as a result of consolidation of clients and prospective clients in the industry verticals that we serve.\nWe must effectively manage our costs to be successful. If we do not achieve our cost management objectives, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business plan and expectations for the future require that we effectively manage our cost structure, including our operating expenses and capital expenditures across our operations. Our management team, along with members of the Board, formed a project committee focused on cost-saving initiatives and other restructuring efforts. The committee reviewed each of our business segments and other operational areas to identify both one-time and recurring cost-saving opportunities. In 2020, our management team continued to review and adjust our cost structure and operating footprint, optimize our operations, and invest in improved technology. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, which we believe will result in meaningful future savings, some of which have already been realized. However, we may not be able to recognize all identified potential savings and even if we are able to recognize the identified savings, such cost savings may be insufficient to achieve our cost management objectives. To the extent that we do not successfully manage our costs our financial results may be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance has harmed our commercial reputation and relationship with customers, vendors, and other commercial parties, and may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.\nOur declining financial performance has caused customers and vendors to increase scrutiny on payment and performance terms in our agreements, which may impose additional costs (or result in reduced profitability) in our operations. Clients, vendors, and partners, as well as prospective clients, vendors, and partners) may also decline to do business with us due to their concerns regarding our financial condition. Additionally, due to our liquidity constraints, we may be unable to aggressively price our services to win work in competitive bid situations. These impediments to working with clients, vendors and partners may reduce both our overall revenues and profitability, and consequently the value of our common stock.\nLikewise, our declining financial performance has negatively affected employee morale and compensation. Due to financial constraints, we may have difficulty providing compensation that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate employees, especially skilled professionals for whom sizable bonus payouts are a key element of market-driven cash compensation. Furthermore, the decline in the price of our common stock has eroded the value of our equity-based incentive programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees despite our financial performance and within the resource constraints, it will impair our ability to effectively serve our clients, which in turn is likely to reduce both our overall revenues and profitability, and consequently the value of our common stock.\nThe transition of our common stock to the OTCQX may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NYSE in July 2020 and is now traded in the over-the-counter market, or OTCQX. Securities traded in over-the-counter markets generally have substantially less volume and liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange such as the NYSE as a result of various factors, including the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, fewer market makers in the securities and a reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage. As a result, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares and our stock price could experience additional downward pressure. Furthermore, the price of our common stock could be subject to greater volatility and could be more likely to be affected by market conditions and fluctuations, changes in our operating results, market perception of us and our business, and announcements by us or other parties with an interest in our business. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nPrivacy, information security and other regulatory requirements may prevent or impair our ability to offer our products and services.\nWe are subject to and affected by numerous laws, regulations, and industry standards that regulate direct marketing activities, including those that address privacy, data protection, information security, and marketing communications. Please refer to the section above entitled \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation\u201d for additional information regarding some of these regulations.\nAs a result of increasing public awareness and interest in privacy rights, data protection and access, information security, environmental protection, and other concerns, national and local governments and industry organizations regularly consider and adopt new laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines that restrict or regulate marketing communications, services, and products. Examples include data encryption standards, data breach notification requirements, registration/licensing requirements (often with fees), consumer choice, notice, and consent restrictions and penalties for infractions, among others. In addition, on May 25, 2018 the European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) took effect. The GDPR applies to all products and services we provide in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d). GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU. For example, we may be required to implement measures to change or limit (by age, use or geography) our service offerings. We may also be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in the EU before processing data for certain aspects of our services. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance and, over the past 12 months, the European Union has levied some significant fines on companies for violation of the GDPR. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires businesses collecting information about California consumers to disclose what personal information is collected about a consumer and the purposes for which that personal information is used, disclose what personal information is sold or shared for a business purpose, and to whom, and delete information or stop selling such information upon request (subject to exceptions). We anticipate that additional restrictions and regulations will continue to be proposed and adopted in the future. The Philippines has adopted the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10173) which mirrors most important aspects of the GDPR and is likely to have a similar effect on our operations in and involving the Philippines. In light of the intense focus on privacy issues, we expect that similar regulations will be adopted in other jurisdictions in which we operate or generate revenue.\nOur business may also be affected by the impact of these restrictions and regulations on our clients and their marketing activities. In addition, as we acquire new capabilities and deploy new technologies to execute our strategy, we may be exposed to additional regulation. Current and future restrictions and regulations could increase compliance requirements and costs, and restrict or prevent the collection, management, aggregation, transfer, use or dissemination of information (especially with respect to personal information), or change the requirements so as to require other changes to our business or our clients' businesses. Additional restrictions and regulations may limit or prohibit current practices regarding marketing communications and information quality solutions. For example, multiple states have implemented opt out legislation for telephone marketing, requiring the creation of statewide do-not call registries. Such legislation could impact our business and the businesses of our clients and of their customers. In addition, continued public interest in privacy rights, data protection and access, and information security may result in the adoption of further industry guidelines that could impact our direct marketing activities and business practices.\nWe cannot predict the scope of any new laws, rules, regulations, or industry guidelines or how courts or agencies may interpret current ones. Additionally, enforcement priorities by governmental authorities will change over time, which may impact our business. Understanding the laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines applicable to specific client multichannel engagements and across many jurisdictions poses a significant challenge, as such laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines are often inconsistent or conflicting, and are sometimes at odds with client objectives. Our failure to properly comply with these regulatory requirements and client needs may materially and adversely affect our business. General compliance with privacy, data protection, and information security obligations is costly and time-consuming, and we may encounter difficulties, delays, or significant expenses in connection with our compliance, or because of our clients\u2019 need to comply. We may be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm, and loss of business in the event that we fail to comply. We could suffer a material adverse impact on our business due to the enactment or enforcement of legislation or industry regulations affecting us and/or our clients, the issuance of judicial or governmental interpretations, changed enforcement priorities of governmental agencies, or a change in behavior arising from public concern over privacy, data protection, and information security issues.\nConsumer perceptions regarding the privacy and security of their data may prevent or impair our ability to offer our products and services.\nVarious local, national, and international regulations, as well as industry standards, give consumers varying degrees of control as to how personal data is collected, used, and shared for marketing purposes. If, due to privacy, security, or other concerns, consumers exercise their ability to prevent or limit such data collection, use, or sharing, it may impair our ability to provide marketing to those consumers and limit our clients\u2019 demand for our services. Additionally, privacy and security concerns may limit consumers\u2019 willingness to voluntarily provide data to our clients or marketing companies. Some of our services depend on voluntarily provided data and therefore may be impaired without such data.\nIf we do not prevent security breaches and other interruptions to our infrastructure, we may be exposed to lawsuits, lose customers, suffer harm to our reputation, and incur additional costs.\nThe services we offer involve the transmission of large amounts of sensitive and proprietary information over public communications networks, as well as the processing and storage of confidential customer information. Unauthorized access, remnant data exposure, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, accidents, employee error or malfeasance, \u201csocial engineering\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, intentional misconduct by computer \u201chackers\u201d and other disruptions can occur, and infrastructure gaps, hardware and software vulnerabilities, inadequate or missing security controls, and exposed or unprotected customer data can exist that (i) interfere with the delivery of services to our customers, (ii) impede our customers' ability to do business, or (iii) compromise the security of our or our customers' systems and data, which exposes information to unauthorized third parties. We are a target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Although we maintain insurance which may cover some types of damages incurred by damage to, breaches of, or problems with, our information and telecommunications systems, such insurance is limited and expensive, and may not be sufficient to offset the costs of such damages or cover certain events, and therefore such damages may materially harm our business.\nOur reputation and business results may be adversely impacted if we, or subcontractors upon whom we rely, do not effectively protect sensitive personal information of our clients and our clients\u2019 customers.\nCurrent privacy and data security laws and industry standards impact the manner in which we capture, handle, analyze, and disseminate customer and prospect data as part of our client engagements. In many instances, our client contracts also mandate privacy and security practices. If we fail to effectively protect and control information, especially sensitive personal information (such as personal health information, social security numbers, or credit card numbers) of our clients and their customers or prospects in accordance with these requirements, we may incur significant expense, suffer reputational harm, loss of business, and, in certain cases, be subjected to regulatory or governmental sanctions or litigation. These risks may be increased due to our reliance on subcontractors and other third parties in providing a portion of our overall services in certain engagements. We cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively protect and handle sensitive personal information or other confidential information, or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event such third parties fail to adequately protect and handle such sensitive or confidential information.\nIf our facilities are damaged, or if we are unable to access and use our facilities, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on the ability of our employees to work at specially equipped facilities to perform services for our clients. Although we have some excess capacity and redundancy, we do not have sufficient excess capacity or redundancy (in equipment, facilities, or personnel) to maintain service and operational levels for extended periods if we are unable to use one of our major facilities. Outsourcing these processes to facilities not owned by us is not a viable option. Should we lose access to a facility for any reason, including as a result of a localized outbreak of COVID-19 or another communicable disease, our service levels are likely to decline or be suspended, clients would go without service or secure replacement services from a competitor. As consequence of such an event, we would suffer a reduction in revenues and harm to (and loss of) client relationships.\nSignificant system disruptions, loss of data center capacity or interruption of telecommunication links could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon data centers and telecommunications infrastructures, which are essential to both our call center services and our database services (which require that we efficiently and effectively create, access, manipulate, and maintain large and complex databases). In addition to the third-party data centers we use, we also operate several of our own data centers to support both our own and our clients' needs in this regard, as well as those of some of our clients. Our ability to protect our operations against damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornadoes, power loss, telecommunications or equipment failure, or other disasters and events beyond our control is critical to our continued success. Likewise, as we increase our use of third-party data centers, it is critical that the vendors providing that service adequately protect their data centers from the same risks. Our services are very dependent on links to telecommunication providers. We believe we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt our operations. Any damage to the data centers we use or any failure of our telecommunications links could materially adversely affect our ability to continue services to our clients, which could result in loss of revenues, profitability and client confidence, and may adversely impact our ability to attract new clients and force us to expend significant company resources to repair the damage.\nIf our new leaders are unsuccessful, or if we continue to lose key management and are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our operating results could suffer.\nOver the past three years we have replaced many of our leaders (including our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Financial Officer) and we have eliminated or consolidated several leadership positions (including Chief Technology Officer, and Executive Vice President of Sales), resulting in a much smaller leadership team. If our new leaders fail in their new and additional roles and responsibilities (and more generally if we are unable to attract additional leaders with the necessary skills to manage our business) our business and its operating results may suffer. Further, our prospects depend in large part upon our ability to attract, train, and retain experienced technical, client services, sales, consulting, marketing, and management personnel. While the demand for personnel is also dependent on employment levels, competitive factors, and general economic conditions, our recent business performance may diminish our attractiveness as an employer. The loss or prolonged absence of the services of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or operating results.\nWe could fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face claims for intellectual property infringement.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part on the protection of our technology, products, services, and brands through intellectual property right protections, including copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, trademarks, as well as through domain name registrations, and enforcement procedures. The extent to which such rights can be protected and enforced varies by jurisdiction, and capabilities we procure through acquisitions may have less protection than would be desirable for the use or scale we intend or need. Litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights has become far more common and expensive in recent years, and we face the risk of additional litigation relating to our use or future use of intellectual property rights of third parties.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information and technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur. We cannot be certain that trademark registrations will be issued, nor can we be certain that any issued trademark registrations will give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, others may develop competing technologies or databases on their own. Moreover, there is no assurance that our confidentiality agreements with our employees or third parties will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information.\nThird-party infringement claims and any related litigation against us could subject us to liability for damages, significantly increase our costs, restrict us from using and providing our technologies, products or services or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies, products, and services. We may also be subject to such infringement claims against us by third parties and may incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources in responding to such claims, as we have in the recent past. We have been, and continue to be, obligated under some agreements to indemnify our clients as a result of claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. These costs and distractions could cause our business to suffer. In addition, if any party asserts an infringement claim, we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights may have an adverse effect on our ability to provide our products and services.\nBreaches of security, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could severely harm our business and reputation.\nBusiness-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Some of our products and services are accessed through or are otherwise dependent on the internet. Security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services, or well-publicized security breaches that may affect us or our industry (such as database intrusion) could be severely detrimental to our business, operating results, and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, cryptography, or other fields will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the information systems that deliver our products, services, and proprietary database information.\nData suppliers could withdraw data that we rely on for our products and services.\nWe purchase or license much of the data we use for ourselves and for our clients. There could be a material adverse impact on our business if owners of the data we use were to curtail access to the data or materially restrict the authorized uses of their data. Data providers could withdraw their data if there is a competitive reason to do so, if there is pressure from the consumer community or if additional regulations are adopted restricting the use of the data. We also rely upon data from other external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers and various government and public record sources. If a substantial number of data providers or other key data sources were to withdraw or restrict their data, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical, our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially and adversely affected, which could result in decreased revenues, net income (loss), and earnings (loss) per share.\nWe are unlikely to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares.\nAlthough our board of directors has in the past authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we announced in 2016 that we did not plan to declare any further dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, although our board has authorized stock purchase programs (and we repurchased shares as recently as 2015), we are unlikely to make any repurchases in the near term. Decisions to pay dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock will be based upon periodic determinations by our board that such dividends or repurchases are both in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements and in the best interest of our stockholders after considering our financial condition and results of operations, the price of our common stock, credit conditions, and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board. The failure to pay a cash dividend or repurchase stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInterest rate increases could affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nInterest rate fluctuations in Europe and the U.S. can affect the amount of interest we pay related to our debt and the amount we earn on cash equivalents. Borrowings under our Texas Capital Bank credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon the prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position could be materially or adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates. We also have exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the U.S., specifically money market, commercial paper, and overnight time deposit rates, as these affect our earnings on excess cash. Even with the offsetting increase in earnings on excess cash in the event of an interest rate increase, we cannot be assured that future interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that, after 2021, it will stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. Though the transition to an alternative rate is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's earnings, the transition to an alternative rate may cause interest rates, revenue, and expenses on financial instruments tied to LIBOR, such as our Texas Capital Bank credit facility, to be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operations outside the U.S.\nHarte Hanks conducts business outside of the U.S. During 2020, approximately 17.7% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the U.S., primarily Europe and Asia. We may expand our international operations in the future as part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in local, national, and international legal requirements or policies resulting in burdensome government controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes, or export license requirements;\n\u2022\nhigher rates of inflation;\n\u2022\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises;\n\u2022\nless favorable labor laws that may increase employment costs and decrease workforce flexibility;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax treatment;\n\u2022\nless favorable foreign intellectual property laws that would make it more difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation;\n\u2022\nmore onerous or differing data privacy and security requirements or other marketing regulations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nsocial, economic, and political instability;\n\u2022\nthe differing costs and difficulties of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nmodifications to international trade policy, including changes to or repeal of the North American Free Trade Agreement or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical risk and adverse market conditions caused by changes in national or regional economic or political conditions (which may impact relative interest rates and the availability, cost, and terms of mortgage funds), including with regard to Brexit.\nIn addition, exchange rate fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from foreign investments. We have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The various risks that are inherent in doing business in the U.S. are also generally applicable to doing business anywhere else and may be exacerbated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws, and regulations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and we are also required to establish disclosure controls and procedures under applicable SEC rules. An effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud. Management is required to provide an annual assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing may reveal significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. In the past these assessments and similar reviews have led to the discovery of material weaknesses, all of which have been remediated. However, no assurance can be given that we won't discover material weaknesses in the future. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expenses and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404.\nWhile an effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting are generally not capable of preventing or detecting all financial reporting errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, is designed to reduce rather than eliminate the risk of material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override and failure in human judgment. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses (i) we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations; (ii) our reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed; (iii) the market price of our stock could decline; and (iv) we could be subject to litigation and/or investigations or sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), or other regulatory authorities.\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the impact of COVID-19 on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nFluctuation in our revenue and operating results and other factors may impact the volatility of our stock price.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded in recent years has fluctuated greatly and has declined significantly. Our common stock price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following (some of which are beyond our control):\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results from period to period and variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors, and the financial community;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe transition of our common stock from the NYSE to the OTCQX;\n\u2022\nunanticipated developments with client engagements or client demand, such as variations in the size, budget, or progress of engagements, variability in the market demand for our services, client consolidations, and the unanticipated termination of several major client engagements;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments affecting our businesses;\n\u2022\ncompetition and the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe overall strength of the economies of the markets we serve and general market volatility; and\n\u2022\nother factors discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nBecause of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover protections that may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in conjunction with provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not allow written consents by stockholders, and have strict advance notice and disclosure requirements for nominees and stockholder proposals.", "PERMNO": 79903, "SIC": 7331, "TIC": "HRTH"}
