The following identifies those which we consider to be most important:\nRISKS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE\nAn interruption of operations at either our Atchison facility, our Indiana facility, at the ICP facility, or a disruption of transportation services could negatively affect our business.\nThe bulk of our ingredient solutions production takes place at our facility in Atchison, while food grade alcohol is produced at both our Atchison and Indiana facilities. An interruption in or loss of operations at either of our facilities could reduce or postpone production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. To the extent that our value-added products rely on unique or proprietary processes or techniques, replacing lost production by purchasing from outside suppliers becomes more difficult.\nWe hold a substantial amount of inventory of aged whiskeys and bourbons at our Indiana facility. If there were a catastrophic event at our Indiana facility, our business could be adversely affected. The loss of a significant amount of aged inventory - through fire, natural disaster, or otherwise - could result in a significant reduction in supply of the affected product or products and could result in customer claims against us.\nWe source industrial alcohol products from ICP. We participate in ICP's operating results through our equity investment in ICP. An interruption in or loss of operations at ICP\u2019s Pekin, Illinois facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nA disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to our facilities and impact our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner.\nOur profitability is affected by the costs of energy, grain, and flour that we use in our business, the availability and cost of which are subject to weather and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to recoup in our selling prices changes in the prices of commodities and natural gas.\nGrain and flour costs are a significant portion of our costs of goods sold. Historically, the cost of such raw materials has been subject to substantial fluctuation, depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which we have no control. These include crop conditions, weather, disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition for acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, purchases by foreign governments, and changes in demand resulting from population growth and customer preferences. The price of natural gas also fluctuates based on anticipated changes in supply and demand, weather and the prices of alternative fuels. Fluctuations in the price of commodities and natural gas can be sudden and volatile at times and have had, from time to time, significant adverse effects on the results of our operations. Higher energy costs could result in higher transportation costs and other operating costs.\nWe have eliminated futures and options contracts because we can purchase corn for delivery up to 12 months into the future under our grain supply agreements. We intend to contract for the future delivery of flour only to protect margins on expected ingredients sales. On the portion of volume not hedged, Management will attempt to recover higher commodity costs through higher sales prices, but market considerations may not always permit this. Even where prices can be adjusted, there would likely be a lag between when we experience higher commodity or natural gas costs and when we might be able to increase prices. To the extent we are unable to timely pass increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers under sales contracts, market fluctuations in the cost of grain, natural gas and ethanol may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe source our grain and wheat flour from a limited number of suppliers.\nWe have a signed supply agreements with Bunge Milling for our grain supply (primarily corn) and Ardent Mills (formerly ConAgra Mills) for our wheat flour. If either of these companies encounters an operational or financial issue, or otherwise can not meet our supply demands, it could lead to an interruption in supply to us and/or higher prices than those we have negotiated or than are available in the market at the time.\nThere may be risks with the effectiveness or execution of our new five-year strategic plan.\nIf our business strategy is unsuccessful, or if we otherwise fail to develop or implement effective strategies, our growth, stock price, or financial results could suffer. More broadly, consumers may shift away from spirits (particularly brown spirits) or high fiber, high protein, or non-GMO products. Many of these risks are beyond our control. Failure to effectively execute or implement our strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny business interruptions and the timing of the associated insurance recovery, if any, may cause volatility in our operating results.\nIn January 2014, we experienced a fire at our Indiana facility. In December 2014, we negotiated a final settlement with our insurance carrier to close this claim. As part of the settlement, MGP agreed to assume the risk of any future downtime of the repaired equipment until the permanent replacement is installed, which is expected by the end of 2015. The cost of the replacement is likely to exceed the cost of settlement funds received from the insurance carrier. Because the potential exists for business interruption until completion of permanent repairs, and because the installation is complex, we may experience volatility in our future operating results.\nDuring October 2014, we experienced a fire at our Atchison facility. We are currently working with our insurance carrier to determine the coverage for equipment repairs and business interruption losses. Because the timing and amount of the business interruption and the insurance recovery may differ, we may experience volatility in our future operating results.\nICP, like many others in the ethanol industry, has recently experienced high levels of profitability, resulting in a disproportionate share to our improvements in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, and these levels may not be sustained. Because of ICP's recent strong financial performance, ICP was able to distribute cash to us, but this may not recur.\nOur proportionate share of the profits of ICP has recently had a significant positive impact on our net income. The significant earnings improvement from 2013 to 2014 was due to much improved margins in the production of chemical intermediates and high quality alcohol. The improved margins were driven primarily by a low current supply and strong demand for these products and for fuel grade alcohol, which affects their pricing. We currently expect that ICP's recent levels of profitability may not be sustained and, as a consequence that ICP's contributions to our future net income may be reduced.\nOn December 4, 2014, we received a $4,835 distribution from ICP. This is the first distribution we have received from ICP, and there is no assurance such distributions will be received in the future.\nIf ICP incurs losses, it could result in closure of its Pekin facility. ICP\u2019s access to capital may limit needed financing. Either of these events could result in reduced sales and impairment losses in the future for us.\nICP's Limited Liability Company Agreement grants the right to either member to elect to shut down the Pekin facility if ICP operates at an EBITDA loss of $500 in any quarter, subject to the right of the other member to override that election. If the Objecting Member overrides the election, then EBITDA loss and EBITDA profit for each subsequent quarter are allocated 80 percent to the Objecting Member and 20 percent to the Electing Member until the end of the applicable quarter in which the Electing Member withdraws its Shutdown Election and thereafter allocations revert to the general 70 percent/30 percent split (subject to a catch-up allocation of 80 percent of EBITDA profits to the Objecting Member until it equals the amount of EBITDA loss allocated to such member on an 80 percent/20 percent basis).\nEither we or ICP Holdings has the absolute right to cause the shutdown of the Pekin facility if ICP losses aggregate $1,500 over any three consecutive quarters or if ICP\u2019s net working capital is less than $2,500.\nICP experienced an EBITDA loss in excess of $500 for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, which was one factor that prompted the Company to provide notice to shut down the facility on April 18, 2013 (withdrawn on March 31, 2014), but ICP experienced positive EBITDA for the remainder of 2013 and has sustained this performance in 2014. There can be no assurance that ICP will continue to experience positive EBITDA. While ICP had a significant amount of cash on hand in late 2014 and a line of credit with SEACOR through January 1, 2016, its ability to secure financing could limit its operations in the future.\nThe Company has a minority interest in ICP, and that could limit our ability to influence ICP's operations and profitability.\nWe have a minority interest in ICP of 30 percent, and have only two representatives on the six-member Advisory Board of ICP. Our minority ownership position and limited advisory role mean that our ability to influence operating decisions and affect profitability of the joint venture is limited. We do not control ICP's operations, strategies, or financial decisions. The majority equity owner may have economic, business or legal interests that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals we would set for ICP. We are dependent on the management of ICP and the other members of the Advisory Board to operate the joint venture profitably and take our interests into account. We must rely on others to implement beneficial management strategies, including appropriate risk management, internal controls over financial reporting, and compliance monitoring. The ICP Limited Liability Company Agreement generally allocates the profits, losses and distributions of cash of ICP based on our percentage membership interest in ICP which is derived from our capital contributions to ICP relative to the total contributions to ICP from all members. Our proportionate share of the earnings and losses are reflected in our financial statements. Any cash distributions from ICP (other than certain mandatory distributions for tax liabilities) must be approved by the Advisory Board, which we do not control.\nOur ability to supply our basic industrial alcohol business is highly dependent on sourcing the product from ICP or unaffiliated third parties.\nPursuant to a Marketing Agreement between us and ICP, ICP manufactured and supplied high quality products, including industrial alcohol, for us and we purchased, marketed and sold such products for a marketing fee until January 1, 2013, when the Marketing Agreement expired.\nOur Atchison and Lawrenceburg facilities are constrained in their ability to produce additional volumes of industrial alcohol. For 2014 and the foreseeable future, we expect that ICP or other third party sources will be important sources of product for us. While we plan to continue to source product from ICP in 2015, ICP is under no obligation to sell us these products. If we are unsuccessful in sourcing product from ICP or other sources, our ability to supply our basic industrial alcohol business at current levels will be limited.\nWe have incurred impairment and restructuring losses in the past and may suffer such losses in the future.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment at year end or if events or circumstances indicate that usage may be limited and carrying values may not be recoverable. Should events indicate the assets cannot be used as planned, the realization from alternative uses or disposal is compared to their carrying value. If an impairment loss is measured, this estimate is recognized. Considerable judgment is used in these measurements, and a change in the assumptions could result in a different determination of impairment loss and/or the amount of any impairment.\nThe markets for our products are very competitive, and our results could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\nThe markets for products in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these markets have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and several are much larger enterprises than us.\nWe are dependent on being able to generate net sales and other operating income in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures. Competition is based on such factors as product innovation, product characteristics, product quality, pricing, color and name. Pricing of our products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or to build new production capacity. If market conditions make our specialty ingredients too expensive for use in consumer goods, our revenues could be affected. If our large competitors were to decrease their pricing, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues could be adversely affected due to the potential loss of sales or market share. Our revenue growth could also be adversely affected if we are not successful in developing new ingredients products for our customers or through new product introductions by our competitors. In addition, more stringent new customer demands may require us to make internal investments to achieve or sustain competitive advantage and meet customer expectations.\nOur unionized workforce could cause interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 143 of our 268 employees were members of a union. Although our relations with our two unions are stable and our labor contracts do not expire until December 2017 and August 2019, there is no assurance that we will not experience work disruptions or stoppages in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nIf we were to lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategies.\nWe rely on the continued services of key personnel involved in management, finance, product development, sales, manufacturing and distribution, and, in particular, upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management team. The loss of service of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot attract and retain key management personnel, or if our search for qualified personnel is prolonged, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, it could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel, and no guarantee exists that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements or assimilate new key management personnel into our organization.\nCovenants and other provisions in our credit facility could hinder our ability to operate. Our failure to comply with covenants in our credit facility could result in the acceleration of the debt extended under such facility, limit our liquidity, and trigger other rights.\nOur credit agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants, including provisions that require us, in certain circumstances, to meet certain financial tests. These covenants may limit or restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npledge the fixed and real property assets; or\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate.\nThese covenants could hinder our ability to operate and could reduce our profitability. For all periods in which the Excess Availability (which is the total availability for loans, less the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 trade payables aged in excess of historical levels and book overdrafts) is less than $10,000, the Borrowers are required to have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (\"FCCR\"), as defined in Note 4: Corporate Borrowings and Capital Lease Obligations, measured on a month end trailing basis, of at least 1.10:1.00 as of each month-end using a trailing twelve-month measure. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financial Covenants.\nIn addition, our credit agreement permits the lender to modify borrowing base and advance rates, the effect of which may limit the amount of loans that we may have outstanding at any given time. The lender may also terminate or accelerate our obligations under the credit agreement upon the occurrence of various events in addition to payment defaults and other breaches, including such matters as a change of control of the Company, defaults under other material contracts with third parties, and ERISA violations. Any modification to reduce our borrowing base or termination of our credit agreement would negatively impact our overall liquidity and may require us to take other actions to preserve any remaining liquidity. Although we anticipate that we will be able to meet the covenants in our credit agreement, there can be no assurance that we will do so, as there are a number of external factors that affect our operations, such as commodity prices, over which we have little or no control. If we default on any of our covenants, and if such default is not cured or waived, our lenders could, among other remedies, terminate its commitment to lend and/or accelerate any outstanding debt and declare that such debt is immediately due and payable. If our lenders were to terminate our credit, or materially change our borrowing base, we may not have sufficient funds available for us to operate. If our lenders were to accelerate our debt, we might be unable to repay such debt immediately and might not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance. Even if new financing were available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. Acceleration could result in foreclosure on assets that we have pledged to our lenders. Further, certain of our other secured debt instruments contain cross default provisions, such that an event of default under our credit agreement with our lenders may result in an event of default under these other debt instruments. If our lenders\nwere to terminate our credit or accelerate our debt, or if our lenders were to materially change our borrowing base, we might not have sufficient funds to operate.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and taxation, and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations, including those relating to greenhouse gases and climate change, may require us to incur substantial expenditures or require us to make product recalls.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the public health and the environment. Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including TTB, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and the USEPA, and by various state and local authorities. Such regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations, including production facilities, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions and other matters. Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties being levied against us, including temporary or prolonged cessation of production, revocation or modification of permits, performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or a cease and desist order against operations that are not in compliance. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or to effect any product recalls. These matters may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur Atchison and joint venture facilities currently produce fuel grade alcohol as a by-product and emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a by-product of the fermentation process. In 2007, the United States Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the USEPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. On February 3, 2010, the USEPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program (\"RFS2\"). We believe these final regulations grandfather both facilities at their current operating capacity for fuel grade alcohol, but facility expansion would need to meet a 20 percent threshold reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce fuel grade alcohol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. Additionally, legislation is pending in Congress on a comprehensive carbon dioxide regulatory scheme, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. We may be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps unknown to us at this time in order to comply with other future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations relating to emission of carbon dioxide could be costly and may require additional capital, which may not be available, preventing us and our joint venture from operating our facilities as originally designed, which may have a material adverse impact on our respective operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe import some of the ingredients used in our production. The import of the ingredients is subject to federal regulation. Difficulty in complying with existing federal rules or any changes in such federal rules could impact how we source our ingredients. This, in turn, could have an impact on our profitability.\nAlso, the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation in the United States and internationally (and, in the United States, at both at the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. This taxation has a minor effect on us; however, it has larger effects on our beverage alcohol customers, and accordingly, an increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could significantly harm our sales revenues and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.\nWe face risk related to changes in the global economic environment.\nOur business may be impacted by the weak United States and global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, unemployment, inflation, fluctuations in debt markets and the strength of the United States economy and the local economies in which we operate. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations and acquisitions, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the financial markets.\nThere could be a number of other effects from these economic developments on our business, including reduced consumer demand for products; insolvency of our customers, resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations and counterparty failures negatively impacting our results of operations, business and financial results.\nA failure of one or more of our key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on information technology (IT) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed and hosted by third-party vendors to assist us in the management of our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication systems; enterprise resource planning; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal, or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Although the Company has an offsite back-up system and disaster recovery plan, any failure of our information systems could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate. Routine maintenance or development of new information systems may result in systems failures, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. This can lead to outside parties having access to privileged data or strategic information of the Company, its employees or customers. Any breach of our data security systems or failure of our information systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive, or business harm, which may adversely affect our business operations or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers, and suppliers. In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nDamage to our reputation, or that of any of our key customers or their brands, could affect our stock price and business performance.\nThe success of our products depends upon the positive image that consumers have of the third party brands that consume our products. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our products and could affect the demand for our products. Unfavorable media, whether accurate or not, related to our industry or to us or our products, or to the brands that consume our products, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance or prospects could negatively affect our corporate reputation, stock price, ability to attract high-quality talent or the performance of our business. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets could cause consumers to react rapidly by avoiding our brands or choosing brands offered by our competitors, which could materially negatively affect our financial results, business and financial condition.\nUnsuccessful research and product launches could affect our profitability.\nResearch activities and products launch activities are inherently uncertain. The failure to launch a new product successfully can give rise to inventory write-offs and other costs and can affect consumer perception of an existing brand. Any significant changes in consumer preferences and failure to anticipate and react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products. Unsuccessful research and product launches could affect our profitability.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR DISTILLERY PRODUCTS SEGMENT\nDisruption in the supply or shortage of oak barrels could negatively affect our business.\nNew oak barrels are available from only a few sources and the industry is currently experiencing a shortage of oak barrels compared to the rapidly increasing demand for products aged in these barrels. The shortage could limit our ability to fulfill our existing customer arrangements and our ability to lay out stock for our own use in future years. The effect of our inability to stock for our own use could also limit future growth and results of operations.\nThe relationship between the price we pay for corn and the sales prices of our distillery co-products can fluctuate significantly and affect our results of operations.\nDried grain, or distillers feed, and fuel grade alcohol are the principal co-products of our alcohol production process and can contribute in varying degrees to the profitability of our distillery products segment. We sell fuel grade alcohol, the prices for which typically, but not always, have tracked price fluctuations in gasoline prices. Distillers feed is sold for prices which historically have tracked the price of corn, but, certain of our co-products compete with similar products made from other plant feedstocks whose cost may not have risen in unison with corn prices. As a result, the profitability of these products to us could be affected.\nDecisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate could affect our future profitability.\nThere is an inherent risk in determining the quantity of maturing stock of aged distillate to lay down in a given year for future sales. This could lead to an inability to supply future demand or lead to a future surplus of inventory and consequent write-down in the value of maturing stocks of aged distillate. As a result, profitability of the distillery products segment could be affected.\nWater scarcity or quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity.\nWater is the main ingredient in substantially all of our distillery products. It is also a limited resource, facing unprecedented challenges from climate change, increasing pollution, and poor management. As demand for water continues to increase, water becomes more scarce and the quality of available water deteriorates, we may be affected by increasing production costs or capacity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to litigation directed at the beverage alcohol industry and other litigation.\nCompanies in the beverage alcohol industry are, from time to time, exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising, product liability, alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. Such litigation may result in damages, penalties or fines as well as damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and financial results.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.\nIn recent years, there has been increased social and political attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry. The recent attention has focused largely on public health concerns related to alcohol abuse, including drunk driving, underage drinking, and the negative health impacts of the abuse and misuse of beverage alcohol.\nAnti-alcohol groups have, in the past, advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could, in turn, significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial results.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\nOur focus on higher margin specialty ingredients may make us more reliant on fewer, more profitable customer relationships.\nOur business strategy for our ingredient solutions segment includes focusing our efforts on the sale of specialty proteins and starches to targeted domestic consumer packaged goods customers. Our major focus is directed at food ingredients, which are primarily used in foods that are developed to address consumers\u2019 desire for healthier and more convenient products; these consist of dietary fiber, wheat protein isolates and concentrates and textured wheat proteins. The bulk of our applications technology and research and development efforts are dedicated to providing customers with specialty ingredient solutions that deliver nutritional benefits, as well as desired functional and sensory qualities to their products. Our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected if our customers were to determine to reduce their new product development (\"NPD\") activities or cease using our unique dietary fibers, starches and proteins in their NPD efforts. In addition, our sales growth opportunities could be at risk in these areas if consumers abandon or significantly limit their interest in healthier foods, limit their interest in convenience foods and/or adopt a widespread aversion to foods containing wheat gluten.\nAdverse public opinion about any of our specialty ingredients could reduce demand for our products.\nConsumer preferences with respect to our specialty ingredients might change. In fact, in recent years, we have noticed shifting consumer preferences with respect to gluten and increased media attention directed at gluten intolerance. Shifting consumer preferences could decrease demand for our specialty ingredients. This could, in turn, significantly decrease our revenues and revenue growth, which could have a material adverse affect on our cash flows, financial condition and financial results.\nNew products competing with our Fibersym\u00ae resistant starch could lead to decreasing margins and lower profitability.\nOur patent rights to Fibersym\u00ae will expire in 2017. We are already facing competition with our Fibersym\u00ae resistant starch. This competition could lead to diminished returns and lower our margins. Over the next two to three years, we could face increased costs from intellectual property defense. Each of these events could result in significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and financial results.\nWe may experience a supply disruption of certain textured wheat proteins.\nOn December 29, 2014 we gave notice to our 50 percent-owned joint venture subsidiary, DMI, and our business partner in DMI, C&D, to terminate the joint venture effective June 30, 2015. C&D also provided notice to us to terminate DMI on June 30, 2015. Pursuant to German law, commencing on June 30, 2015, normal operations for DMI will cease and a one-year winding up process will begin. DMI\u2019s primary operation is the production and tolling of the Trutex\u00ae/Wheatex\u00ae series of textured wheat proteins made from vital wheat gluten and DMI has been the sole source of our supply of Trutex\u00ae/Wheatex\u00ae for the past two years. The ability to find another source to supply the product will be critical to our continued ability to market Trutex\u00ae/Wheatex\u00ae. We are in the early stages of finding alternative sources for production for our Trutex\u00ae/Wheatex\u00ae product within the United States. Any difficulties we have in finding these alternative sources, qualifying one or more as a supplier, and successfully starting up production may result in shortages of product to meet customer demand, which could impact our operating results, cash flows and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nCommon stockholders have limited rights under our Articles of Incorporation.\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to elect five of our nine directors and only holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with respect to a merger, dissolution, lease, exchange or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, or on an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, unless such action would increase or decrease the authorized shares or par value of the Common or Preferred Stock, or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Common or Preferred Stock so as to affect the holders of Common Stock adversely. Generally, the Common Stock and Preferred Stock vote as separate classes on all other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nThe majority of the outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock is beneficially owned by one individual, who is effectively in control of the election of five of our nine directors under the limited rights of the common stockholders under our Articles of Incorporation.\nThe trading volume in our common stock fluctuates depending on market conditions. The sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the price of our stock and make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our public float at December 31, 2014 (including non-vested restricted stock awards held by non-affiliates) was approximately 11,645,491 shares, as approximately 6,307,968 shares are held by affiliates. Over the year ended December 31, 2014, our daily trading volume as reported to us by NASDAQ has fluctuated from 700 to 391,400 shares (excluding block trades). When trading volumes are relatively light, significant price changes can occur even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded and an investor\u2019s ability to quickly sell quantities of stock may be affected.", "PERMNO": 12226, "SIC": 2085, "TIC": "MGPI"}
