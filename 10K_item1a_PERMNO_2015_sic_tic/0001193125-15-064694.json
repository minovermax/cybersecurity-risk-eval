{"cik": "1036960", "company": "FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nA description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market and its price has fluctuated significantly in the past. Additionally, our stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect its market price without regard to our operating performance. We believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results, earnings below analysts\u2019 estimates and financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, our common stock, the stock market in general and the market for shares of semiconductor industry-related stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation, reduction or delay in delivery schedules, which may result in lower than expected revenues.\nWe manufacture products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. The semiconductor industry is occasionally subject to double booking and rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand and macro economic conditions. Accordingly, many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty. As a result, we must commit resources to the manufacture of products without binding purchase commitments from customers. Even in cases where our standard terms and conditions of sale or other contractual arrangements do not permit a customer to cancel an order without penalty, we may from time to time accept cancellations to maintain customer relationships or because of industry practice, custom or other factors. Our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on both our levels of inventory and revenues. Additionally, fluctuations in demand may cause our inventories to increase or decrease more than we have anticipated. While we currently believe our inventory levels are appropriate for the current economic environment, continued global economic uncertainty may result in lower than expected demand. When we anticipate increasing demand in our markets, lower than anticipated demand may impact our customers\u2019 target inventory levels. Our current business forecasting is still qualified by the risk that our backlog may deteriorate as a result of customer cancellations.\nDownturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end user market demands could reduce the profitability and overall value of our business, which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have other adverse effects on our financial position.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and the value of our business may decline as a result of market response to this cyclicality. As we have experienced in the past, uncertainty in global economic conditions may continue to negatively affect us and the rest of the semiconductor industry, by causing us to experience backlog cancellations, higher inventory levels and reduced demand for our products. We may experience renewed, possibly severe and prolonged, downturns in the future as a result of this cyclicality. Even as demand increases following such downturns, our profitability may not increase because of price competition\nand supply shortages that historically accompany recoveries in demand. In addition, we may experience significant fluctuations in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, product mix, end user markets, the costs associated with the introduction of new products, and our efforts to reduce excess inventories that may have built up as a result of any of these factors. The markets for our products depend on continued demand for consumer electronics such as personal computers, cellular telephones, tablet devices, digital cameras, and automotive, household and industrial goods. Deteriorating global economic conditions may cause these end user markets to experience decreases in demand that could adversely affect our business and future prospects.\nOur failure to execute on our cost reduction initiatives and the impact of such initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nWe continue to implement cost reduction initiatives to keep pace with the evolving economic and competitive conditions. Most recently, we announced our intention to close our West Jordan and Penang manufacturing facilities and the 5-inch line at our Korea manufacturing facility.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement any of these actions, or if these actions and other actions we may take will help reduce costs. Because restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. Even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business.\nWe may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changing customer demands or we may develop the wrong products.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to innovate and create revenues from new product introductions. Failure to develop new technologies, or react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay development of new products and lead to decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. Our financial performance depends on our ability to identify important new technology advances and to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. While new products often command higher prices and higher profit margins, we may not successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them for use in new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Many of our competitors are larger and more established companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. If we fail to identify a fundamental shift in technologies or in our product markets such failure could have material adverse effects on our competitive position within the industry. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue our efforts to reduce die sizes, develop new packages and improve manufacturing yields. We cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals.\nIf some original equipment manufacturers do not design our products into their equipment, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our ability to have original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), or their contract manufacturers, choose our products. Frequently, an OEM will incorporate or specifically design our products into the products it produces. In such cases the OEM may identify our products, with the products of a limited number of other vendors, as approved for use in particular OEM applications. Without \u201cdesign wins,\u201d we may only be able to sell our products to customers as a secondary source, if at all. If an OEM designs another supplier\u2019s product into one of its applications, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins for that application because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the OEM. Even if a customer designs in our products, we are not guaranteed to receive future sales from that customer. We may be unable to achieve these \u201cdesign wins\u201d because of competition or a product\u2019s functionality, size, electrical characteristics or\nother aspect of its design or price. Additionally, we may be unable to service expected demand from the customer. In addition, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenue from that customer and we may be unable to convert design into actual sales.\nWe depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer, contract manufacturing, industrial, automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications which incorporate our products. Reduced consumer or corporate spending due to increased energy and commodity prices or other economic factors could affect our revenues.\nIf we provide revenue, margin or earnings per share guidance, it is generally based on certain assumptions we make concerning the health of the overall economy and our projections of future consumer and corporate spending. If our projections of these expenditures are inaccurate or based upon erroneous assumptions, our revenues, margins and earnings per share could be adversely affected. For example, reduced demand for automobiles and appliances reduced our revenue during 2011 and 2012, while weakness in the high-end smart phone market negatively impacted earnings in 2013. We cannot be certain that a change in macroeconomic conditions will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have lengthy product development cycles that may cause us to incur significant expenses without realizing meaningful sales, the occurrence of which would harm our business.\nDesigning and manufacturing semiconductors is a long process that requires the investment of significant resources with no guarantee that the process will ultimately result in sales to customers. We have made significant investments in new product designs and technologies. The lengthy front end of our development cycle creates a risk that we may incur significant expenses which we are unable to offset with meaningful sales. Additionally, customers may decide to cancel their products or change production specifications, which may require us to modify product specifications and further increase our cost of production. Failure to meet such specifications may also delay the launch of our products or result in lost sales.\nResearch and development investments may not yield profitable or commercially viable products and thus will not necessarily result in increases in our revenues.\nWe invest significant resources in our research and development. In 2014 alone, we invested $165.8 million in research and development. Despite such efforts, we may not be successful in developing commercially viable products. Additionally, there is a substantial risk that we may decide to abandon a potential product that is no longer marketable, despite our investment or significant resources in its development.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. These laws are subject to legislative and regulatory change or through changes in court interpretations of those laws and regulations. For example, there have been recent developments in the laws and regulations governing the issuance and assertion of patents in the U.S., including modifications to the rules governing patent prosecution. There have also been court rulings on the issues of willfulness, obviousness and injunctions, that may affect our ability to obtain patents and/or enforce our patents against others. Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. With respect to our intellectual property generally, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nthe patents owned by us or numerous other patents which third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies; or\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.\nIn addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. We cannot assure that we will be able to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights in every country in which our products are sold or manufactured.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such research. We have non-exclusive licenses to some of our technology from National Semiconductor (now owned by Texas Instruments), Infineon, Samsung Electronics and other companies. These companies may license such technologies to others, including our competitors or may compete with us directly. In addition, National Semiconductor and Infineon have limited royalty-free, worldwide license rights to some of our technologies. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under patents or intellectual property rights claimed by others. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use some technologies may negatively affect our financial results.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. From time to time, we are required to defend against claims by competitors and others of intellectual property infringement. Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in the semiconductor industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. From time to time, we may be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents issued to other companies. Such claims may relate both to products and manufacturing processes. We may engage in license negotiations regarding these claims from time to time. Even though we maintain procedures to avoid infringing others\u2019 rights as part of our product and process development efforts, it is impossible to be aware of every possible patent which our products may infringe, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to avoid infringement claims. Furthermore, even if we conclude our products do not infringe another\u2019s patents, others may not agree. We have been and are involved in lawsuits, and could become subject to other lawsuits, in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of other companies. For example, since October 2004, we have been in litigation with Power Integrations, Inc. See Item 8. Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Our involvement in this litigation and future intellectual property litigation, or the costs of avoiding or settling litigation by purchasing licenses rights or by other means, could result in significant expense to our company, adversely affecting sales of the challenged products or technologies and diverting the efforts and attention of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. We may decide to settle patent infringement claims or litigation by purchasing license rights from the claimant, even if we believe we are not infringing, in order to reduce the expense of continuing the dispute or because we are not sufficiently confident that we would eventually prevail. In the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nindemnify our customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us violate the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nstop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue manufacturing processes; or\n\u2022\nobtain licenses to the intellectual property we are found to have infringed.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources.\nWe may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions of various sizes since we became an independent company in 1997 and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses. The costs of acquiring and integrating related businesses, or our failure to integrate them successfully into our existing businesses, could result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. In addition, we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete.\nWe are constantly evaluating acquisition opportunities and consolidation possibilities and are frequently conducting due diligence or holding preliminary discussions with respect to possible acquisition transactions, some of which could be significant.\nIf we acquire another business, the process of integrating an acquired business into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require us to use significant financial resources on the acquisition that may otherwise be needed for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nunexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nconforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to realize anticipated synergies;\n\u2022\nnegotiating with labor unions;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u2022\nin addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of other businesses we acquire.\nPossible future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may face risks associated with dispositions of assets and businesses.\nFrom time to time we may dispose of assets and businesses in an effort to grow our more profitable product lines. When we do so, we face certain risks associated with these exit activities, including but not limited the risk that we will disrupt service to our customers, the risk of inadvertently losing other business not related to the exit activities, the risk that we will be unable to effectively continue, terminate, modify and manage supplier and vendor relationships, and the risk that we may be subject to consequential claims from customers or vendors as a result of eliminating, or transferring the production of affected products or the renegotiation of commitments related to those products.\nWe depend on suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials of acceptable quality. Production time and product costs could increase if we were to lose a primary supplier or if we experience a significant increase in the prices of our raw materials. Product performance could be affected and quality issues could develop as a result of a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials we use in our products.\nOur manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. Our manufacturing operations depend upon our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly. If the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on our increased operating expenses to our customers. This could result in decreased profit margins for the products in which the materials are used. Results could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. For example, some phosphorus-containing mold compound received from one supplier and incorporated into our products in the past resulted in a number of claims for damages from customers. We purchase some of our raw materials such as silicon wafers, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and chemicals and gases from a limited number of suppliers on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We subcontract a minority of our wafer fabrication needs, primarily to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Global Foundries, Tower Jazz Semiconductor, Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Central Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Jilin Magic Semiconductor, Macronix International Co. Ltd., and Phenitec Semiconductor. In order to maximize our production capacity, some of our back-end assembly and testing operations are also subcontracted. Primary back-end subcontractors include, Advance Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., AIC Semiconductor Sdn Bhd, Amkor Technology, AUK Semiconductor PTE, Ltd, GEM Services, Inc., Greatek Electronics, Inc., Hana Microelectronics Ltd, Liteon, Inc., Tak Cheong Electronics (Holdings) Co. Ltd, and United Test and Assembly Center Thai Ltd. Our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated.\nDelays in expanding capacity at existing facilities, implementing new production techniques, or incurring problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions, all could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies.\nOur manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in determining our profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields and cause defects in the final product. We are constantly looking for ways to expand capacity or improve efficiency at our manufacturing facilities. For example, we are in the process of rationalizing our global manufacturing footprint and increasing our reliance on external foundries, a process that may require us to reduce and/or transfer internal capacities into another existing internal facility or to an external foundry. As is common in the semiconductor industry, we may experience difficulty in completing the transitions. As a consequence, we have suffered delays in product deliveries or reduced yields in the past and may experience such delays again in the future.\nWe may experience delays or problems in bringing new manufacturing capacity to full production. Such delays, as well as possible problems in achieving acceptable yields, or product delivery delays relating to existing or planned new capacity could result from, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately.\nWe depend on efficient use of our manufacturing capacity because low utilization rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.\nOur ability to efficiently manage the available capacity in our fabrication facilities is a key element of our success. As a result of our high fixed costs, a reduction in capacity utilization, as well as reduced yields or unfavorable product mix, could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our operating results. Utilization rates may be reduced by many factors including: periods of industry overcapacity, low levels of customer orders, operating inefficiencies, mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion or relocation of operations, power interruptions and fire, flood or other natural disasters or calamities. Potential delays and cost increases that result from these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on subcontractors to reduce production costs and to meet manufacturing demands, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nMany of the processes we use in manufacturing our products are complex requiring, among other things, a high degree of technical skill and significant capital investment in advanced equipment. In some circumstances, we may decide that it is more cost effective to have some of these processes performed by qualified third party subcontractors. In addition, we may utilize a subcontractor to fill unexpected customer demand for a particular product or process or to guaranty supply of a particular product that may be in great demand. More significantly, as a result of the expense incurred in qualifying multiple subcontractors to perform the same function, we may designate a subcontractor as a single source for supplying a key product or service. If a single source subcontractor were to fail to meet our contractual requirements, our business could be adversely affected and we could incur production delays and customer cancellations as a result. We would also be required to qualify other subcontractors, which would be time consuming and cause us to incur additional costs. In addition, even if we qualify alternate subcontractors, those subcontractors may not be able to meet our delivery, quality or yield requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition to these operational risks, some of these subcontractors are smaller businesses that may not have the financial ability to acquire the advanced tools and equipment necessary to fulfill our requirements. In some circumstances, we may find it necessary to provide financial support to our subcontractors in the form of advance payments, loans, loan guarantees, equipment financing and similar financial arrangements. In those situations, we could be adversely impacted if the subcontractor failed to comply with its financial obligations to us.\nCompliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nPursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC has promulgated new disclosure requirements for manufacturers of products containing certain minerals which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them. While the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit recently determined that certain provisions of the law violate the First Amendment, the new disclosure rules became effective in May of 2014. We filed our first conflict minerals report on Form SD at the end of that month. The implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the metals used in the manufacture of our products. The regulations may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that the metals used in our products are free of conflict minerals.\nA significant portion of our sales are made to distributors who can terminate their relationships with us with little or no notice. The termination of a distributor could reduce sales and result in inventory returns.\nPlease refer to Item 1. Business Sales, Marketing, and Distribution included in this report for a discussion of our distributor sales in 2014. As a general rule, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and they may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. Additionally, because distributors may offer competing products, certain distributors may be less inclined to sell our products as our direct sales increase. The loss of one or more of our distributors, or the decision by one or more of them to reduce the number of our products they offer or to carry the product lines of our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of a significant distributor, whether at our or the distributor\u2019s initiative, or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors, could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\nThe semiconductor business is very competitive, especially in the markets we serve, and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company.\nWe participate in the standard component or \u201cmulti-market\u201d segment of the semiconductor industry. While the semiconductor industry is generally highly competitive, the \u201cmulti-market\u201d segment is particularly so. Our competitors offer equivalent or similar versions of many of our products, and customers may switch from our products to our competitors\u2019 products on the basis of price, delivery terms, product performance, quality, reliability and customer service or a combination of any of these factors. Competition is especially intense in the multi-market semiconductor segment because it is relatively easy for customers to switch between suppliers of more standardized, multi-market products like ours. In the past we have experienced decreases in prices during \u201cdown\u201d cycles in the semiconductor industry, and this may occur again as a result periodic downturns in global economic conditions. Even in strong markets, price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices. We compete in a global market and our competitors are companies of various sizes in various countries around the world. Many of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources available to them. As such, they tend to have a greater ability to pursue acquisition candidates and can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Additionally, companies with whom we do not currently compete may introduce new products that may cause them to compete with us in the future.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees, is intense, particularly when the business cycle is improving. During such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees. While we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at accomplishing this goal, specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require.\nIf we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees, our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected. Our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stock-based compensation programs.\nLike most technology companies, we have a history of using employee stock-based incentive programs to recruit and retain our workforce in a competitive employment marketplace. Our success will depend in part upon the continued use of stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance-based equity awards as a compensation tool. While this is a routine practice in many parts of the world, foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult. Such regulations tend to\ndiminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries. With regard to all equity based compensation, our current practice is to seek stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under the Fairchild Semiconductor 2007 Stock Plan as well as other amendments that may be adopted from time to time which require stockholder approval. If these proposals do not receive stockholder approval, we may not be able to grant stock options and other equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past, which could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, and we may need to increase cash compensation in order to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, since 2009 we have relied almost exclusively on grants of restricted stock units and performance-based equity awards in place of stock options. While we believe that our compensation policies are competitive with our peers, we cannot provide any assurance that we have not, and will not continue in the future to lose opportunities to recruit and retain key employees as a result of these changes.\nChanges in forecasted stock-based compensation expense could impact our gross margin percentage, research and development expenses, marketing, general and administrative expenses and our tax rate.\nWe may face product warranty or product liability claims that are disproportionately higher than the value of the products involved.\nOur products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several dollars, whereas the personal computer might be sold by the computer maker for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some products that are defective or that do not perform to published specifications. Additionally, while we attempt to contractually limit our customers\u2019 use of our products, we cannot be certain that our distributors will not sell our products to customers who intend to use them in applications for which we did not intend them to be used. Since a defect or failure in one of our products could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. For example, in 2013, the customer of one of our distributors filed suit against us claiming damages of $30.0 million arising out of the purchase of $20,000 of our products. Furthermore, even though we attempt, through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts, to contractually limit our liability to replace the defective goods or refund the purchase price, we cannot be certain that these claims will not expose us to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. In the past, we have received claims for charges, such as for labor and other costs of replacing defective parts or repairing the products into which the defective products are incorporated, lost profits and other damages. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities, whether by contracts or otherwise, may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. And, even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer\u2019s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result.\nOur operations and business could be significantly harmed by natural disasters.\nOur manufacturing facilities in China, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and many of the third party contractors and suppliers that we currently use are located in countries that are in seismically active regions of the world where earthquakes and other natural disasters, such as floods and typhoons may occur. For example, on October 15, 2013, our manufacturing facility in the Philippines experienced a magnitude 7.2 earthquake. While we take precautions to mitigate these risks, we cannot be certain that they will be adequate to protect our facilities in the event of a major earthquake, flood, typhoon or other natural disaster. Although we maintain insurance for some of the damage that may be caused by natural disasters, our insurance coverage may not be\nsufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not cover us for lost business. As a result, a natural disaster in one of these regions could severely disrupt the operation of our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters could affect our supply chain or our customer base which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business, the cost of and demand for our products and our results of operations.\nWhile the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, flooding in Thailand and the recent earthquake in the Philippines did not materially impact us, the occurrence of natural disasters in certain regions, could have a negative impact on our supply chain, our ability to deliver products, the cost of our products and the demand for our products. These events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the U.S. and worldwide economies. Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur international operations subject our company to risks not faced by domestic competitors.\nThrough our subsidiaries we maintain significant operations and facilities in the Philippines, Malaysia, China, South Korea and Singapore. We have sales offices and customers around the world. Approximately 74% of our revenues in the year ended December 28, 2014 were from Asia. The following are some of the risks inherent in doing business on an international level:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations relating to, amongst other things, import and export tariffs, taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights and property,\n\u2022\nwork stoppages; and\n\u2022\nthe laws, including tax laws, and the policies of the U.S. toward, countries in which we manufacture our products.\nAdditionally, one of our foundry subcontractors maintains manufacturing facilities and certain of its corporate and sales offices in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect us, to the extent we transfer some of our operations to this subcontractor. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Israel has been and continues to be subject to armed conflict with neighboring states and terrorist activity, with varying levels of severity. We can provide no assurance that security and political conditions will not adversely impact our subcontractor\u2019s business in the future. Our subcontractor could experience serious disruption to its manufacturing facilities in Israel if acts associated with this conflict result in any serious damage to those facilities.\nWe acquired significant operations and revenues when we acquired a business from Samsung Electronics and, as a result, are subject to risks inherent in doing business in Korea, including political risk, labor risk and currency risk.\nWe have significant operations and sales in South Korea and are subject to risks associated with doing business there. Korea accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue for the year ended December 28, 2014. As of fiscal year end 2014, approximately 26.0% of our total production is from our South Korea facility.\nRelations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense over most of South Korea\u2019s history, and more recent concerns over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and cyber terrorism capabilities, have created a global security issue that may adversely affect Korean business and economic conditions in South Korea and in the U.S. We cannot assure you as to whether or when this situation will be resolved or change abruptly as a result of current or future events. An adverse change in economic or political conditions in South Korea or in its relations with North Korea could have a material adverse effect on our Korean subsidiary and our company. In addition to other risks disclosed relating to international operations, some businesses in South Korea are subject to labor unrest.\nOur Korean sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our Korean operations\u2019 costs of goods sold and operating expenses are denominated in South Korean won. Although we have taken steps to fix the costs subject to currency fluctuations and to balance won revenues and won costs as much as possible, a significant change in this balance, coupled with a significant change in the value of the won relative to the dollar, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nIncreases in our effective tax rate may have a negative impact on our business.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including: the locations where our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the outcome of certain tax audits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, increases in non-deductible expenses, changes in available tax credits, changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. income and expenses; changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and our decision to repatriate non U.S. earnings.\nA change in foreign tax laws or a difference in the construction of current foreign tax laws by relevant foreign authorities could result in us not recognizing any anticipated benefits.\nSome of our foreign subsidiaries have been granted preferential income tax or other tax holidays as an incentive for locating in those jurisdictions. A change in the foreign tax laws or in the construction of the foreign tax laws governing these tax holidays, or our failure to comply with the terms and conditions governing the tax holidays, could result in us not recognizing the anticipated benefits we derive from them, which would decrease our profitability in those jurisdictions. While we continue to monitor the tax holidays, the income tax laws governing the tax holidays, and our compliance with the terms and conditions of the tax holidays there is still a risk that we may not be able to recognize the anticipated benefits of these tax holidays.\nWe have significantly expanded our manufacturing operations in China and, as a result, will be increasingly subject to risks inherent in doing business in China, which may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe expect a significant portion of our production from our Suzhou, China facility will be exported out of China, however, we are hopeful that a significant portion of our future revenue will result from the Chinese markets in which our products are sold, and from demand in China for goods that include our products. As of fiscal year end 2014, approximately 22.5% of our total production is from the Suzhou facility. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in that country\u2019s laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, foreign exchange restrictions, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations in China are subject to the economic and political situation there. We believe that our operations in China are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that China\u2019s central or local governments will not impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures. Changes in the political environment or government policies could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between China and the U.S. could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products in China. The legal system of China relating to foreign trade is relatively new and continues to evolve. There can be no certainty as to the\napplication of its laws and regulations in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the value of foreign and domestic currency and interest rates.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks and to protect against reductions in the value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, we have established hedging programs. These hedging programs may utilize certain derivative financial instruments. For example, we may use a combination of currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange denominated revenues and expenses. Gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in negligible net exposure to us. A majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do conduct these activities by way of transactions denominated in other currencies, primarily the Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Philippine peso, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Taiwanese dollar, British pound and the Euro. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Please refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report for a discussion on the impacts of an adverse change in exchange rates and an increase in interest rates would have on our financial statements. While we have established hedging policies and procedures to monitor and prevent unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations, we can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.\nIn addition to our currency exposure, we have interest rate exposure with respect to our credit facility due to its variable pricing. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and we can provide no assurance that a sudden increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial performance.\nWe are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses.\nIncreasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of pollutants that can be released from our operations into the environment. While the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with these and any future regulations could require significant capital investments in pollution control equipment or changes in the way we make our products. In addition, because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes, we are subject to risks of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, resulting from our use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines, any of which could be material to our cash flow or earnings. For example:\n\u2022\nwe currently are remediating contamination at some of our operating plant sites;\n\u2022\nwe have been identified as a potentially responsible party at a number of Superfund sites where we (or our predecessors) disposed of wastes in the past; and\n\u2022\nsignificant regulatory and public attention on the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in more stringent regulations, further increasing our costs.\nAlthough most of our known environmental liabilities are covered by indemnification agreements with Raytheon Company, National Semiconductor Corporation (now owned by Texas Instruments), Samsung\nElectronics and Intersil Corporation, these indemnities are limited to conditions that occurred prior to the consummation of the transactions through which we acquired facilities from those companies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that their indemnity obligations to us for the covered liabilities will be available, or, if available, adequate to protect us.\nOur senior credit facility limits our flexibility and places restrictions on the manner in which we run our operations.\nAt December 28, 2014, we had total debt of $200.1 million and the ratio of this debt to equity was approximately 0.2 to 1.0. As of December 28, 2014, our credit facility consists of a $400.0 million revolving line of credit. Adjusted for outstanding letters of credit, we had up to $199.4 million available under the revolving loan portion of the senior credit facility. In addition, there is a $300.0 million uncommitted incremental revolving loan feature. Despite the significant reductions we have made in our long-term debt, we continue to carry indebtedness which could have significant consequences on our operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of our interest expense, because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the instruments governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, repurchase stock or pay cash dividends. Failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness, which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results may be subject to substantial fluctuations. While we currently have sufficient cash flow to satisfy all of our current obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in the future. Further, we can make no assurances that our currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. In addition, because our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate, our cost of borrowing will increase if market interest rates increase. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renew or refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our\nliquidity. Restrictions imposed by the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into some business operating and financing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of potentially profitable business opportunities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility may limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests. The credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us that affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets, pay dividends, sell assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions, make investments or engage in other business activities. These restrictions could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors many of which are not subject to such limitations.\nIn addition, the senior credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios. As of December 28, 2014, we were in compliance with these ratios. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against our assets, including any collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under the senior credit facility accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the integrity of our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information. It could also result in regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.", "PERMNO": 87139, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "FCS"}
