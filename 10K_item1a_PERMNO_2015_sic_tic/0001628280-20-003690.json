{"cik": "1712463", "company": "Ranpak Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to secure a sufficient supply of paper to meet our production requirements given the limited number of suppliers that produce paper suitable for our products.\nA limited number of paper mills produce paper that is suitable for use in our products in the markets in which we operate, and if they fail, experience interruptions in service, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to fill our purchase orders, we may not be able to produce enough of our paper consumables to meet our own production requirements. In addition, there are several grades or types of paper that we use in our products that we obtain from a single source due to the specificity of our requirements and limitations in the available paper products in a given market. For example, in 2019 we purchased approximately 60% of our raw paper requirements in North America from a single supplier, WestRock Company (\u201cWestRock\u201d). Increasing consolidation among our suppliers or the paper supply market more broadly may increase our reliance on existing suppliers or impact our ability to obtain alternative suppliers, if necessary.\nIf WestRock, or one of our other major suppliers of paper in any of the markets in which we operate, fails or experiences an interruption or delay in service, there may be short-term or long-term disruption in our ability to secure paper from qualified sources and we may not have enough inventory to maintain our production schedule or continue to provide paper consumables to our distributors and end-users on a timely basis, or at all. For example, at most of our facilities, quantities of raw paper stored on-site represent approximately five days of paper consumables production at such facilities due to cost savings and storage limitations. Any such failure, interruption or delay may result in on-site paper storage at our paper consumable production facilities being depleted and, as a result, a reduction in the volume of production and sales of our paper consumables, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPaper pricing may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins, and financial condition.\nOur primary input is kraft paper, which we purchase from various paper suppliers around the world. Increases in global or regional market demand for paper-based products could increase the cost of the kraft paper we purchase. Increases in the price of kraft paper could also result from, among other things, increases in the cost of the raw materials used in paper production or increases in the cost of the energy our suppliers use to manufacture paper.\nWhile historically, we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher paper costs both by entering into annual fixed-price contracts with our suppliers, as well as by increasing the selling prices of our products, if we are unable to minimize the effects of any increases in paper costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers to provide both the components used in our protective packaging systems as well as certain fully-assembled protective packaging systems.\nThese risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe risk that our supplier agreements will be terminated, or that we will not be able to renew our agreements on favorable economic terms, and as a result our cost of goods will increase\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that our suppliers, including those in China that supply a majority of the components and systems provided to our end-users, will experience operational delays or disruptions, including as a result of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, that will affect our ability to produce protective packaging systems or provide them to our distributors and end-users\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that our suppliers will fail, or will no longer be able to provide the components which we use to produce our protective packaging systems\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that our suppliers will not be able to meet an increase in demand for the components which we use to produce our protective packaging systems\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that our suppliers\u2019 costs will increase, and that they will increase the prices of components or fully-assembled protective packaging systems\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that suppliers of fully-assembled protective packaging systems will increase their prices or will no longer be able to provide us with protective packaging systems\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe risk that our suppliers in China will be subject to increased trade barriers as a result of U.S.-Chinese trade measures, and such trade barriers will increase the costs of these components and systems or negatively impact our ability to purchase these components and systems.\nFor example, since the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in China in December 2019, we have experienced delays in the supply of certain components used in the assembly of certain of our protective packaging systems. Should these delays continue or should our supply of such components be interrupted, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, some of our third party suppliers for components and fully-assembled systems, including certain suppliers impacted by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, represent our only source for such products. If we are unable to continue to purchase such components and systems from such suppliers, we may face additional costs or delays, or be unable to obtain similar components and systems. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nWe experience competition in the markets for our products and services.\nWe compete with a number of companies that produce and/or sell similar or competing packaging products from a variety of materials. We have several foreign and domestic competitors that are well established in the protective packaging market, including some with substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have or broader geographic reach. Many of our existing competitors also invest substantial resources in ongoing research and development, and we anticipate increased competition as consumer preferences and other trends increase the appeal of our product areas. To the extent that our competitors introduce new products or technologies, such developments could render our products obsolete, less competitive or uneconomical.\nWe compete with these companies on, among other factors, the performance characteristics of our products, service, price, and the ability to develop new packaging products and solutions. Accordingly, we may not be able to maintain a competitive advantage over our competitors with respect to these or other factors, which may adversely affect our net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nUnfavorable end-user responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, and especially in periods of rising paper costs, we increase the prices of our products. Significant price increases, particularly if not taken by competitors in respect of similar products, could result in lower net sales. For instance, interruptions in paper supply may lead us to increase the price of our paper consumables while plastic-based packaging competitors would not similarly increase the price of their products, which may result in a reduction in our market share and net sales. Such loss of end-users or lower net sales may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDemand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in end-user or consumer preferences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur net sales depends primarily on the volume of purchases by our end-users in the e-commerce industry and other industries it serves. End-user preferences for packaging formats, as well as the preferences of our end-users, can influence net sales. Changes in these preferences, as well as changes in consumer behavior generally, could negatively impact demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMoreover, we position ourselves in the protective packaging market as the leading environmentally sustainable protective packaging solutions provider. Although we believe a market and consumer preference for environmentally sustainable solutions is a trend that is likely to continue, there is no guarantee that it will do so or that we will benefit from the continuing trend. If the current trend in favor of environmental sustainability does not continue, diminishes, or shifts away from paper and fiber-based products, demand for our products could decrease, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations, including through reduced net sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and earnings. Additionally, the advent of emerging or improved technologies, such as the potential widespread availability of lower cost bio-plastics or increased recyclability of resin-based packaging solutions, could satisfy market and consumer demand for environmentally sustainable packaging solutions and negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations even if the current trend in favor of environmentally sustainable solutions continues.\nContinued consolidation in sectors in which many of our end-users operate may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of the sectors in which many of our end-users operate, such as the e-commerce, automotive after-market, IT/electronics, machinery and home goods markets, have been consolidating in recent years, and this trend may continue. Because our business relies on integrating our protective packaging systems into end-users\u2019 existing operations and generating revenue through the sale of our paper consumables, increased consolidation may have an adverse impact on our or our distributors\u2019 ability to attract\nadditional end-users or retain existing end-users, or on the pricing of our products and services, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe loss of end-users, particularly our e-commerce end-users, or a reduction in their production requirements, could have a significant adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nAlthough we have a diverse base of end-users, the loss of significant end-users or a large group of end-users, or a reduction in their production requirements, could have an adverse effect on our net sales and, depending on the magnitude of the loss or reduction, our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that our existing end-user relationships will continue or be renewed at the same level of production, or at all, in the future.\nIn particular, a number of our e-commerce end-users that currently use our paper consumables for void-fill, cushioning or wrapping, including our largest single end-user which accounted for approximately 10.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, have established internal goals or initiatives relating to reducing the quantity of consumables that they utilize in their product packaging as part of environmental responsibility initiatives. If these end-users achieve their goals or if additional end-users pursue similar initiatives, they may require a reduced quantity of our paper consumables for protective packaging of their products. The loss of any e- commerce end-users, or a reduction in their purchasing levels, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur performance, competitive position and prospects for future growth could be negatively impacted if new products we develop do not meet sales or margin expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur performance is dependent in part on our continuing ability to develop products that appeal to end-users by providing new or enhanced value propositions and provide us with a favorable return on the products\u2019 cost through sales of paper consumables. The development and introduction cycle of each of these new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment. New products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to (i) accurately predict demand, end-user preferences and evolving industry standards\u037e (ii) resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner\u037e or (iii) achieve manufacturing efficiencies. To the extent any new products do not meet our sales or margin expectations, our competitive position and future growth prospects may be negatively impacted, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur investments in research and development may not yield the results expected.\nIn order to compete in the protective packaging market, we must, among other things, adapt to changing consumer preferences and a competitive market through technological innovation. As a result of technological innovation as well as changing consumer preferences, new products can become standardized rapidly, leading to more intense competition and ongoing price erosion. In order to maintain our competitive advantage, we have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development of new products and technologies. However, these investments may not yield the innovation or results expected on a timely basis, or at all, and any resulting technological innovations may not lead to successful new products or otherwise improve our performance and competitive advantage. Furthermore, our competitors may develop new products that are better suited to meet consumer demands, may develop and introduce such products before we are able to do so or may otherwise negatively impact the success of our new products, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur efforts to expand beyond our core product offerings and into adjacent markets may not succeed and could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may seek to expand beyond our core fiber-based protective packaging systems and develop products or business strategies that have wider applications for manufacturers, end-users, or consumers. Expanding into new markets would require us to devote substantial additional resources to such expansion, and our ability to succeed in developing such products to address such markets is not certain. It is likely that we would need to take additional steps, such as hiring additional personnel, partnering with new third parties and incurring considerable research and development expenses, in order to pursue such an expansion successfully.\nAny such expansion would be subject to additional uncertainties. For example, we could encounter difficulties in attracting new end-users due to lower levels of familiarity with our brand among potential distributor partners and end-users in markets we do not currently serve. As a result, we may not be successful in future efforts to expand into or achieve profitability from new markets, new business models or strategies or new product types, and our ability to generate net sales from our current products and continue our existing business may be negatively affected. If any such expansion does not enhance our ability to maintain or grow net sales or recover any associated development costs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nUncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand, unfavorable changes in product price/mix, or lower profit margins. For example, global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our end-users, such as automotive companies, distributors, electronic manufacturers, machinery manufacturers, home goods manufacturers and e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and other end-users that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending.\nDuring economic downturns or recessions, there can be heightened competition for net sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as end-users may reduce their volume of purchases. Also, reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our end-users and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as the sales of materials and equipment to affected end-users. This could also result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable from distributors or end-users. If we lose significant sales volume, are required to reduce our selling prices significantly or are unable to collect amounts due, there could be a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe maintain production facilities in three countries and territories, and our products are distributed to approximately 50 countries and territories around the world. A substantial portion of our operations are located outside of the United States and 54.8% of our 2019 sales were generated outside of the United States. These operations, particularly in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. and European operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact our cash flows or operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange controls and tax rates, and exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations governing foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange, such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds, which may affect our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise and may limit our ability to convert foreign cash flows into U.S. dollars\u037e\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions such as those on trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures\u037e\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, and the effects of retaliatory trade measures\u037e\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations, including those affecting trade and foreign investment and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cForeign Corrupt Practices Act\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax laws, or changes to such laws or the interpretation of such laws, affecting taxable income, tax deductions, or other attributes relating to our non-U.S. earnings or operations\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulties of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulties of enforcement and variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights\u037e\n\u2022\nmore expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations\u037e\n\u2022\nimport and export delays caused, for example, by an extended strike at the port of entry, or major disruptions to international or domestic trade routes due to strikes, shortages, acts of terrorism or acts of war could cause a delay in our supply chain operations\u037e\n\u2022\ngeographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world\u037e\n\u2022\npolitical, social, legal and economic instability, civil unrest, war, catastrophic events, acts of terrorism, and widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. including the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with data protection and privacy regulations in many of the countries in which we operate, including the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the EU which has been in effect since May 2018. Under this\nregulation, our collection, processing storage, use and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a\nresult of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views on data privacy or security breaches.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on the import of Chinese goods, or if China places tariffs or other restrictions on the import of U.S. goods, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on the import of Chinese goods or if China places significant tariffs or other restrictions on the import of U.S. goods, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For example, in September 2018, the U.S. government assessed a 10% tariff on thousands of categories of goods, including parts that we import from China to our domestic facilities to assemble our protective systems. Additionally, the U.S. government continues to signal that it may alter trade agreements and terms between China and the United States, including limiting trade with China, and may impose additional tariffs on imports from China. If additional duties are imposed or increasingly retaliatory trade measures taken by either the United States or China, we could need to materially increase our capital expenditures relating to the assembly of our protective systems, which could require us to raise our prices and result in the loss of end-users and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek alternative supply sources outside of China which may result in significant costs and disruption to our operations. In any such event, our business could be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, or the imposition of additional tariffs, any of which could cause us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, and could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA major loss of or disruption in our assembly and distribution operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA disruption in operations at one or more of our assembly and distribution facilities, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. Disruptions could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems, outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing\nnovel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, strikes or other labor unrest, transportation interruption, government regulation, contractual disputes, political unrest or terrorism. For example, we operate in leased facilities in Reno, Nevada, Raleigh, North Carolina, Kansas City, Missouri, and Nyrany, Czech Republic. If we are unable to renew leases at existing facilities on favorable terms or to relocate our operations to nearby facilities in an orderly fashion upon the expiration of those leases, we could suffer interruptions in our production and significant increases in costs.\nFurthermore, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key assembly or paper converter facilities is unable to assemble our products or convert raw paper into our paper consumables, respectively, for an extended period of time, our net sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to meet our distributors\u2019 and end-users\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nApproximately 54.8% of our net sales in 2019 were generated outside the United States. We translate net sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from our international operations and in translating our financial results back to U.S. dollars. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, we reported international net sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of ours goods versus those of our competitors.\nForeign exchange rates may also impact the ability of our customers to secure sufficient funds in U.S. dollars or European currency to purchase goods for export. For example, many of our distributors are local entities in the markets in which they operate and utilize foreign currencies to operate their business. Such distributors must convert their local currency into U.S. dollars or European currency in their business with us, for which foreign exchange rate fluctuations may present additional challenges for the operation of their business. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results or business. As exchange rates vary, our results of operations and profitability may be harmed.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and end- users, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of end-users and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.\nWe also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that are subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and end-user controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our end- users and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to both our domestic and international operations, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit us from authorizing, offering, or directly or indirectly providing improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-parties, our employees, representatives, contractors and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with anticorruption and related laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, or agents will comply with these laws at all times. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProduct liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands.\nClaims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. We could also be required to recall possibly defective products, or voluntarily do so, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses and reduced net sales. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage.\nPolitical and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our end-users or suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries/regions or regions in which we or our end-users or suppliers operate including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage, epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government actions, including sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials, the expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement of funds. In particular, if additional restrictions on trade with\nRussia were adopted by the European Union or the United States, and were applicable to our products, we could lose revenue and experience lower growth rates in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third party distributors to store, sell, market, service and distribute our products.\nWe rely on our network of third party distributors to store, sell (in the case of paper consumables), market, service and distribute our protective packaging systems and paper consumables to a majority of our end-users. Because we rely on third party distributors, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk that distributors may terminate or decline to renew their contractual relationship with us\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may not be able to renew our contracts with distributors on the same contractual terms\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that distributors, or the services that they rely on, will fail, or will be unable to deliver our protective packaging systems and paper-based products in a timely manner\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that distributors will be otherwise unable or unwilling to sell, market, service and distribute our products to end users at the same rate they have historically, or at all\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe risk that end-users will increasingly seek to purchase consumables directly from suppliers, which would require us to alter our business model in order to accommodate direct-to-consumer sales.\nIf we fail to maintain our relationships with our distributors, or if our distributors do not meet the sales, marketing and service expectations of our end-users, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for delivery of our raw materials, as well as for transportation to certain select end-users to which we directly sell our products. In particular, a significant portion of the raw materials we use are transported by ship, railroad or trucks, which modes of transportation are highly regulated. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, or fail to deliver our products to our direct end-users in a timely manner, we might be unable to manufacture our products in response to end-user demand. For example, at most of our facilities, quantities of raw paper stored on-site represent approximately five days of paper consumables production at such facilities due to cost savings and storage limitations. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, it might be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively impact our end-user relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could experience disruptions in operations and/or increased labor costs.\nIn Europe, most of our employees, including most of our employees in the Netherlands, are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual or bi-annual basis. In addition, as our business expands globally we may be subject to new labor-related requirements that may impose additional requirements or costs on our business. As is the case with any negotiation, we may not be able to negotiate or renew acceptable collective bargaining agreements in such cases, which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. A disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs.\nWe are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacture and assembly of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water and the use, handling, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.\nMany jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our assembly and warehouse facilities and operations. Any failure to obtain, maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties, revocation or non-renewal of our permits, or orders to temporarily or permanently cease certain operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products. For example, we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations for our European operations as a result of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Directive \u201cRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals\u201d (EU Directive No. 2006/1907) enacted on December 18, 2006. The directive, known as REACH, imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in Europe. The EU also enacted in 2008 a \u201cClassification, Labeling and Packaging\u201d regulation, known as the CLP Regulation, which aligns the EU system of classification, labeling and packaging of chemical substances to the Globally Harmonized System. Other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements. Compliance with these requirements can be costly.\nWe cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost of environmental compliance, industrial hygiene within our facilities, product registration, or environmental remediation. Environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time and may continue to do so. Our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to these evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions. As a result of such requirements, we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden, including significant future environmental compliance, hygiene, health and safety obligations.\nIncreased compliance costs, increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and the NYSE. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, NYSE and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and uninsured judgments or a rise in insurance premiums may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in our areas of operation around the world, including product liability claims, actions brought against us by our employees and other legal proceedings. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn accordance with customary practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all.\nIf any significant accident, judgment, claim (or a series of claims) or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, the cost of such accident, judgment, claim(s) or other event could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance as to the actual amount of these liabilities or the timing thereof. We cannot be certain that the outcome of current or future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to protect or maintain our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks, and this loss of a competitive advantage may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property, this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased net sales or increased operating costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products, aspects thereof, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. There is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be\nissued for our pending patent applications. Furthermore, we have historically focused and expect to continue to focus on strategically protecting our patents, including through pursuing infringement claims, which, especially in Europe, carries the risk that a court will determine our patents are invalid or unenforceable.\nTrademark and trade name protection is important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the United States and in the foreign countries/regions in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries/regions may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld.\nIntellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur acquisition and integration of businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, from time to time we consider acquisitions that either complement or expand our existing lines of business. We are unable to predict the size, timing and number of acquisitions we may complete, if any, in the future. Integrating acquired businesses may create substantial costs, delays or other problems for us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we also may pay fees and expenses associated with financing acquisitions to investment banks and other advisors. We may also assume the liabilities of an acquired company, there can be no assurances that all potential liabilities will be identified or known to us and any such liabilities could materially adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or realize all of the expected synergies from previously acquired businesses or related strategic initiatives. If we are unable to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve from our strategic initiatives, we could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, while we execute these acquisitions and related integration activities, it is possible that our attention may be diverted from our ongoing operations which may have a negative impact on our business.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.\nOur business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.\nOur overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors, including earnings in the United States.\nWe have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes, employee benefit items, interest expense carryforwards, and other items. We have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities that have been generated as a result of the transaction, within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences. We expect to realize the assets over an extended period. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and/or certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and corporate and financing structure. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. Additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely effected in a material way. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the U.S., may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities\u037e\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances\u037e\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation\u037e\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof\u037e or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets.\nWe record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including end user relationships, trademarks and developed technologies. We test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment may result from, among other things, (i) a decrease in our expected net earnings\u037e (ii) adverse equity market conditions\u037e (iii) a decline in current market\nmultiples\u037e (iv) a decline in our common stock price\u037e (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates\u037e (vi) heightened competition\u037e (vii) strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions\u037e or (viii) a more- likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of. In the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, we might have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges in connection with the business combination that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence on Rack Holdings before we acquired it, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in Rack Holdings\u2019 business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our and Rack Holdings\u2019 control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be noncash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are dependent upon certain key personnel.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including our senior management. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers and our inability to hire and retain replacements could have a detrimental effect on us and negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nDisruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit, including secured credit facilities, term loans and a revolving credit facility. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAdditionally, conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities.\nOur debt financing may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment in us.\nWe are a borrower under senior secured credit facilities provided by Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division consisting of a $270.9 million dollar-denominated first lien term facility, a \u20ac139.7 million euro-denominated first lien term facility and a $45.0 million revolving facility. Our senior secured credit facilities, impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities which may adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or to engage in new business activities or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy compared to our competitors who have less debt. In some cases, these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. Subject to certain exceptions, such agreements restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock and make guarantees\u037e\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets\u037e\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or fundamental changes\u037e\n\u2022\nsell assets\u037e\n\u2022\npay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock\u037e\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\namend organizational documents\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into certain agreements that would restrict the ability to incur liens on assets\u037e\n\u2022\nrepay certain junior indebtedness\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into sale leasebacks;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nin the case of the direct parent holding company of the US Borrower, engage in activities other than passively holding the equity interests in the US Borrower.\nFurther, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements, including with respect to the senior secured credit facilities, could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by our existing and future financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur level of outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to fulfill our obligations.\nWe have outstanding debt, and the outstanding indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nadversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payment of principal and interest on our debt and fees on our letters of credit, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nsubject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases based upon variable interest rates, including our outstanding borrowings (if any)\u037e\n\u2022\nincrease the possibility of an event of default under the financial and operating covenants contained in our existing debt instruments\u037e and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions, reduce our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make it more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions of our business than their competitors with less debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest with respect to our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash and our future financial results. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt obligations, we might be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain new or additional such facilities. However, we might not be able to refinance our existing debt or obtain any such new or additional facilities on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund our operations or growth.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the Company.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from the date of our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find\nour securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nOur management was unable to make a full assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company completed the Ranpak Business Combination on June 3, 2019. Prior to the Ranpak Business Combination, the Company was a publicly-traded, blank check company and the Ranpak business was part of a private, Delaware limited partnership. As a result, the design of public company internal controls over financial reporting for the Company post-Ranpak Business Combination has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel. Therefore, management was unable, without deploying an unreasonable level of resources, to conduct an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. Therefore, the Company is excluding from this Annual Report on Form 10-K management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 215.02 of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations.\nDespite the fact that our management was unable to make a full assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting, in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we believe to be a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on the determination that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as a result of an insufficient number of trained professionals with an appropriate level of public-company accounting knowledge, training and experience, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. Management has developed a plan to remedy this material weakness, but there can be no guarantee that it will be executed in the time anticipated by management. Moreover, there can be no guarantee that such material weakness, so long as it prevails, does not lead to errors in our financial statements.\nIn addition, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. There can be no guarantee that, once such requirement applies to us, the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement will not result in the identification of additional deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to Ranpak\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies or material weaknesses could lead to errors in our financial statements and will also require us to expend time and resources in executing a remediation.\nProvisions in our organizational documents may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A common stock and could entrench management.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur organizational documents designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company and our stockholders, to the fullest extent permitted by law, which could limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents.\nOur organizational documents provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless the Company consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees\u037e\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers or employees arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or the proposed organizational documents\u037e or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers, stockholders or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. However, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Company\u2019s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts with respect to all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, this provision applies to Securities Act claims and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAccordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s proposed organizational documents to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market could occur at any time, either pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on June 13, 2019, as amended, or otherwise. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, JS Capital holds approximately 41.3% of our total outstanding shares, which does not take into account any warrants outstanding that may be exercised. Pursuant to the terms of the forward purchase agreements entered into at the time of the IPO and the reallocation agreement, the founder shares may not be transferred until the earlier to occur of (i) one year after the closing or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the closing, the common stock into which the founder shares convert will be released from these transfer restrictions. Additional sales of our common stock into the market may cause the market price of our common to drop significantly.\nCertain of our stockholders, including JS Capital, own a significant portion of the outstanding voting stock of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2019, JS Capital owns approximately 41.3% of our outstanding common stock, which does not take into account any warrants outstanding that may be exercised. As long as JS Capital owns or controls a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, JS Capital will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our organizational documents, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. The interests of JS Capital may not align with the interests of our other shareholders. JS Capital is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. JS Capital may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur, Class A common stock and warrants are listed on the NYSE. We cannot guarantee that our securities will remain listed on the NYSE. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities\u037e\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our securities\u037e\n\u2022\na determination that our Class A common stock are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities\u037e\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage\u037e and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and the Company. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our public shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRedemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the anchor investors, the BSOF entities or their respective permitted transferees.\nWarrants, including those issued in connection with the business combination, will become exercisable for our common stock, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock, would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market, and result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 15,000,000 of our Class A common stock as part of the units sold in the IPO and, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we issued in the private placement an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants, approximately 570,700 of which are still outstanding, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock or Class C common stock, as applicable, at $11.50 per share. We also issued 5,000,000 forward purchase warrants concurrently with the closing of the sale of the forward purchase shares. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A common stock and reduce the value of the Class A common stock.\nTo the extent our outstanding warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, such dilution could, among other things, limit the ability of our current shareholders to influence our management through the election of directors.\nThe price for our securities may be volatile.\nThe price of our securities can vary due to general market and economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. During 2019, our Class A common shares traded between $9.94 and $4.58 per share. Fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. In an active market for our securities, the trading price of our securities following the business combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities following the business combination may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our annual or quarterly financial results or the annual or quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results\u037e\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors\u037e\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the market in general\u037e\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business\u037e\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt\u037e\n\u2022\nthe volume of common stock available for public sale\u037e\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management\u037e\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price for our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease their coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 17309, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "PACK"}
