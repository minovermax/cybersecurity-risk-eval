{"cik": "838875", "company": "WILLAMETTE VALLEY VINEYARDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following disclosures should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the Company\u2019s business as they appear to Management at this time. However, this list is not exhaustive. Other risks may, and likely will, arise from time to time.\nAgricultural risks could adversely affect the Company\nWinemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, including Grapevine Red Blotch Disease (GRBV), drought, frost and certain other weather conditions can affect the quantity of grapes available to the Company, decreasing the supply of the Company\u2019s products and negatively impacting profitability. In particular, certain of the Company\u2019s vines are not resistant to phylloxera; accordingly, those vines are particularly at risk to the effects from an infestation of phylloxera. Phylloxera is a pest that attacks the rootstocks of wine grape plants. Vineyards in the United States, including some in Oregon and some owned by us, have been infested in recent years with phylloxera. In particular, Tualatin Estate Vineyards have phylloxera. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s existing vineyards, or the rootstocks the Company is now using in its planting programs, will not become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera or that the phylloxera present at the Tualatin Vineyards will not spread to our other vineyards. Pierce\u2019s Disease is a vine bacterial disease. It kills grapevines and there is no known cure. Small insects called Sharpshooters spread this disease. A new strain of the Sharpshooter was discovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north. The Company is actively supporting the efforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to prevent an infestation in its own vineyards. The Company cannot, however, guarantee that it will succeed in preventing contamination in its vineyards. Additionally, any future government restrictions created in connection with government attempts to combat phylloxera, GRBV or other pests or viruses may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production.\nOur operations are susceptible to changing weather patterns and other environmental factors\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as hail storms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. Any such extreme weather condition could negatively impact the harvest of grapes at our vineyards and/or the other vineyards that supply us with grapes for our wine. In particular, Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern particularly in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that year\u2019s wine quality.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in weather patterns could adversely affect the Company, especially if such changes impacted the amount or quality of grapes harvested. We cannot anticipate changes in weather patterns/conditions, and we cannot predict their impact on our operations if they were to occur.\nAs weather patterns evolve, the Company\u2019s vineyards, and contracted vineyards, have become susceptible to potential smoke damage as a result of wildfires within the region. In extreme events, smoke can produce effects on grapes that make them unusable in the production of wine. The Company can not predict smoke events or their potential impact were they to occur.\nWe may not be able to economically insure certain risks\nThe Company maintains insurance policies to cover certain risks. However not all risks can be insured, or insured economically, and there may be gaps in coverage that could expose the Company to liability should an event occur. Additionally, we cannot be certain that coverage levels are adequate or that all of our insurers will be financially viable if we make a claim.\nLoss of key employees could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to some degree upon the continued service of a number of key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees, including James W. Bernau, our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Ferry, our Chief Financial Officer and Christine Clair, our Winery Director could harm the Company and its reputation and negatively impact its profitability, particularly if one or more of the Company\u2019s key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate requires adequate funding\nThe Company\u2019s cash flow from operations historically has not been sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Company\u2019s operations. The Company has entered into a line of credit agreement to provide such funds and entered into term loan arrangements, the proceeds of which were used to acquire the Tualatin Winery and the Tualatin Vineyards, construct and remodel the Hospitality Center and pay down the Company\u2019s revolving line of credit. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with all conditions under its credit facilities in the future or that the amount available under its line of credit facility or capital raises will be adequate for the Company\u2019s future needs. Failure to comply with all conditions of the credit facilities, or to have sufficient funds for operations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and shareholder value.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s outstanding long-term debt was approximately $6.0 million but it did not have any outstanding borrowings under its lines of credit. Additionally, the Company had notes payable to private parties of approximately $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\nCosts of being a publicly-held company may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage\nAs a public company, the Company incurs substantial costs that are not incurred by its competitors that are privately-held. These compliance costs may result in the Company\u2019s wines being more expensive than those produced by its competitors and/or may reduce profitability compared to such competitors.\nThe Company faces significant competition which could adversely affect profitability\nThe wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. The Company\u2019s wines compete in several premium wine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines, with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France, as well as Italy, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The Company\u2019s wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and, to a lesser degree, non-alcoholic beverages, for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by the Company\u2019s independent distributors, many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. A result of this intense competition has been and may continue to be upward pressure on the Company\u2019s selling and promotional expenses. In addition, the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than the Company does. In particular, wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have significantly greater resources than the Company. Additionally, greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give many of the Company\u2019s competitors certain unit cost advantages. Company sales may be harmed to the extent it is not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers\u2019 costs. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to successfully compete with its current competitors or that it will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage manufacturers.\nThe Willamette Valley American Viticultural Area (\u201cAVA\u201d) value may be eroded by out of state competition who use it inappropriately or as fanciful marketing\nWine grape growing regions in the United States are divided into American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d), of the United States Department of the Treasury, based on distinguishable geographic features. The Oregon wine industry has historically embraced higher standards for wine production than those established by the federal government and other states. As a result, wines from Oregon AVA\u2019s, and specifically the Willamette Valley AVA, have achieved recognition for their quality against other wines in their class. As a result, these wines are often sold at a higher price point than wines not produced in Oregon. Because of this recognition, out of state competitors have used Oregon AVAs on bottles and packaging claiming its use as fanciful marketing. Such use, inappropriate or otherwise, could have a dilutive effect on the prestige of Oregon AVAs and ultimately the prices that can be charged for wines from Oregon AVAs as a result of reduced competitor quality and/or pricing.\nThe Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most of whom carry extensive product portfolios\nNationwide, the Company sells its products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets, restaurants, hotels and private clubs across the United States and in some overseas markets. Sales to distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s net revenue in the future. A change in the relationship with any of the Company\u2019s significant distributors could harm the Company\u2019s business and reduce Company sales. The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace distributors, poor performance of the Company\u2019s major distributors or the Company\u2019s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major distributors could harm the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to purchase the Company\u2019s products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support. Consolidation at the retail tier, among club and chain grocery stores in particular, can be expected to heighten competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain or reduce prices.\nLoss of the \u201cWillamette Valley Vineyards\u201d and \u201cWillamette\u201d trademarks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s distinction within the AVA\nThe Company has long held the federal trademarks \u201cWillamette Valley Vineyards\u201d and \u201cWillamette\u201d as used in its wine brands. While it is lawful for wine producers meeting the federal and state requirements to list the American Viticultural Area \u201cWillamette Valley\u201d source of their wine grapes and wine on their labels, packaging and advertising materials, the Company has enforced its trademarks on any unauthorized use as a wine brand. These trademarks have been challenged and, should the Company lose this challenge or future challenges, the Company could lose a competitive advantage.\nFluctuations in quantity and quality of grape supply could adversely affect the Company\nA shortage in the supply of quality grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity of the Company\u2019s grape supply, including weather conditions, pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy grapes on long and short term contracts and the number of vines producing grapes. Any shortage in the Company\u2019s grape production could cause a reduction in the amount of wine the Company is able to produce, which could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results from operations. Factors that reduce the quantity of the Company\u2019s grapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could reduce the quality or amount of wine the Company produces. Deterioration in the quality of the Company\u2019s wines could harm its brand name and could reduce sales and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nContamination of the Company\u2019s wines would harm the Company\u2019s business\nThe Company is subject to certain hazards and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through tampering or otherwise, of ingredients or products. Contamination of any of the Company\u2019s wines could cause it to destroy its wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall, which could significantly damage the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality. The Company maintains insurance against certain of these kinds of risks, and others, under various insurance policies. However, the insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to the Company and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.\nA reduction in consumer demand for premium wines could harm the Company\u2019s business\nThere have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the United States and other markets in which the Company participates. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the Company\u2019s product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including: a general decline in economic conditions; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products; the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal, state or foreign excise and other taxes on beverage alcohol products. The competitive position of the Company\u2019s products could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent, reliable quality in the product or service levels to customers.\nChanges in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and business results\nWine sales depend upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending, including the general state of the economy, federal and state income tax rates, deductibility of business entertainment expenses under federal and state tax laws, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Changes in consumer spending in these and other regions can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that customers are willing to purchase at restaurants or through retail outlets. Reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products, limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to increase prices and increased levels of selling and promotional expenses. This, in turn, may have a considerable negative impact upon the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins.\nIncreased regulation and/or taxation could adversely affect the Company\nThe wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d) and various foreign agencies, state liquor authorities, such as the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (\u201cOLCC\u201d), and local authorities. These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, permitted distribution channels, permitted and required labeling, and advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Any expansion of the Company\u2019s existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances, environmental restrictions and other legal requirements. In addition, new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, income taxes, property and sales taxes or international tariffs, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Recently, many states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. Additionally, many states have revised, or are revising, statutes that broaden the definition of nexus to increase tax revenue from out of state businesses.\nNew or revised regulations, or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that new or revised regulations, taxes or increased licensing fees and requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and its results of operations and its cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is thinly traded, and therefore not as liquid as other investments.\nThe trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock on NASDAQ is consistently \u201cthin,\u201d in that there is not a great deal of trading activity on a daily basis. Because the average active trading volume is thin, there is less opportunity for shareholders to sell their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on the open market, resulting in the common stock being less liquid than common stock in other publicly traded companies.\nThe Company may face liabilities associated with the offer and sale of our preferred stock.\nIn August 2015, the Company commenced a public offering of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. The Company registered this transaction with the securities authorities of the States of Oregon and Washington and, in November 2015, achieved listing status on NASDAQ under the trading symbol WVVIP. The terms of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock are unusual for a company of our size, and we believe the structure of these securities and of the offering are not commonplace among issuers of any type. Federal and state securities laws impose significant liabilities on issuers of securities if the related offering documents contain material misstatements of fact, or if the documents omit to state facts necessary, in light of the circumstances as a whole, to prevent the documents from being misleading. These liabilities can include rescission liability to the purchasers of the securities, as well as potential enforcement liability that could give rise to civil money penalties. Securities litigation can be extraordinarily expensive and protracted, and if we are accused of misstatements or omissions in our offering documents, we may face economic harms and management distractions regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such litigation. Further, if we ultimately are adjudged to have actually made a material misstatement or omission, the Company may be liable for the repayment of the purchase price of the related securities, plus interest from the date of purchase. Any one or more of these events or circumstances would have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition or results of operations, and may make it more difficult or more expensive to undertake capital-raising efforts in the future.\nThe Company may be unable to pay accumulated dividends on its Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock bears a cumulative 5.3% dividend based upon the original issue price, or $0.22 per share per annum. However, prior to the declaration and payment of dividends our board of directors must determine, among other things, that funds are available out of the surplus of the Company and that the payment would not render us insolvent or compromise our ability to pay our obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, our existing credit facility limits, and future debt obligations in the future may limit, both our legal and our practical ability to declare and pay dividends. As a result, although the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock will continue to earn a right to receive dividends, the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends will depend, among other things, upon our ability to generate excess cash. However, although shares of our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock will earn cumulative dividends, unpaid dividends will not, themselves, accumulate (as might compounding interest on a debt security, for example).\nAs the Company\u2019s sales revenues are dependent in part upon the purchases made by and continued goodwill with its holders of Preferred Stock, any failure to pay dividends timely could adversely effect the Company\u2019s sales. Additionally, as the Company focuses its issuance of Preferred Stock to wine enthusiasts likely to purchase the Company\u2019s wines, any failure by the Management to successfully target its stock sales could diminish the opportunity to maximize earnings and offset the administrative, regulatory and legal costs of this form of capital formation through Preferred Stockholder wine purchases.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by any preferred stock we may issue. Our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. This includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over common stock with respect to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nFailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers as well as for administrative functions and many of such technology systems are independent on one another for their functionality. We also use information technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products is highly dependent on our technology systems. Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and personnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party\u2019s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers\u2019 or personnel\u2019s data or confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material liability.\nThe provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Oregon law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if that transaction could be beneficial to stockholders. These impediments include, but are not limited to; the classification of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, which makes it more difficult to quickly replace Board members; the ability of our Board, subject to certain limitations under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval; a provision that special meetings of our Board may be called only by our chief executive officer or at the request of holders of not less than half of all outstanding shares of our common stock; a provision that any member of the Board, or the entire Board, may be removed from office only for cause; and a provision that our stockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders. The Board may implement other changes that further limit the potential for tender offers or takeover attempts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our financial results, operations and outlook for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed by federal, state, and local governments in response to the outbreak have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the State of Oregon where we operate the Winery and most of our vineyards, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, are restricted from gathering in groups and, in some areas, have previously been mandated to stay home except for essential activities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and government restrictions, we have at various times closed our tasting rooms and have launched curbside pick-ups and complimentary shipping specials with minimum purchase. We believe the ongoing restrictions and the sudden increase in unemployment caused by the closure of businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our sales revenues, which would adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Even after any stay-at-home orders are loosened or lifted, the impact of lost wages due to COVID-19 related unemployment may dampen consumer spending for some time in the future.\nOur operations could be further disrupted if a significant number of our employees are unable or unwilling to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, restrictions on travel or fear of contracting COVID-19, which could further materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. To support our employees and protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, we may offer enhanced health and welfare benefits, provide bonuses to our employees, and purchase additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials. These measures will likely increase our operating costs and adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely affect the ability of our grape suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us, which may negatively affect our operations. If our suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligation to us, we could face shortages of grapes, and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted.\nWe have also modified our plans for expanding our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To preserve our liquidity, we have delayed some planned capital expenditures. These changes may adversely affect our ability to grow our business, particularly if these projects are delayed for a significant amount of time.\nWe cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last or if it will recur, if new government restrictions and mandates will be imposed or how long they will be effective, or how quickly, if at all, our customers will return to their pre-COVID-19 purchasing behaviors, so we cannot predict how long our results of operations and financial performance may be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 80955, "SIC": 2084, "TIC": "WVVI"}
