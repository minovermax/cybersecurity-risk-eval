The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Lucas Energy, Inc. In addition, please read \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this filing, where we describe additional uncertainties associated with our business and the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this filing.\nOur securities should only be purchased by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this filing before deciding to become a holder of our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be negatively affected to a significant extent.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Industry\nWe require financing to execute our business plan and fund capital program requirements.\nWe believe that our anticipated cash flow from operations, possible proceeds from sales of properties and funding provided by leveraging our capital structure, will not be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating needs for approximately the next twelve months. Additionally, in order to continue growth and to fund our business and expansion plans, we will require additional financing. Moving forward, we hope to pursue third party capital in the form of debt, equity or some combination of the two for certain funding requirements. We may be unsuccessful in obtaining additional financing on attractive terms, if at all. We currently have no committed source of additional cash funding as of the date of this report, and we currently require approximately $3.4 million of additional funding over the next several months in order to participate in drilling activities via participation agreements with a drilling partner and additional funding of approximately $0.5 million for additional planned drilling and workover activities on existing properties.\nDue to our need for immediate funding, and the fact that we have no current source of committed capital, we may be forced to raise capital through the sale of debt or equity in the near term. Additionally, we may not have the time or resources available to seek stockholder approval (if required pursuant to applicable NYSE MKT rules and requirements) for such transactions which may result in the issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding common stock. As such, we may instead rely on an exemption from the NYSE MKT stockholder approval rules which allows an NYSE MKT listed company an exemption from such rules when a delay in securing stockholder approval would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the company. Consequently, our stockholders may not be offered the ability to approve transactions we may undertake in the future, including those transactions which would ordinarily require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations, and/or those transactions which would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe require significant additional financing to continue as a going concern and pay outstanding liabilities and our lack of available funding raises questions regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to drill additional wells and develop our proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs), either because we are unable to raise sufficient funding for such development activities, or otherwise, or in the event we are unable to acquire additional operating properties; we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Furthermore, in the event we are unable to raise additional funding in the future, we will not be able to participate with Earthstone in the drilling of planned additional wells, will not be able to complete other drilling and/or workover activities, and may not be able to make required payments on our outstanding liabilities, including amounts owed on the Letter Loan, and in fact as described in the risk factors below, have not been able to make certain of such payments to date and as such, we are currently in default of the repayment of such Letter Loan. Therefore, in the event we do not raise additional funding in the future we will be forced to scale back our business plan, sell or liquidate assets to satisfy outstanding debts and/or take other steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements also include a going concern footnote from our auditors.\nAdditionally, due to our need for immediate funding, and the fact that we have no current source of committed capital, we may be forced to raise capital through the sale of debt or equity in the near term and we may not have the time or resources available to seek stockholder approval (if required pursuant to applicable NYSE MKT rules and requirements) for such transactions which may result in the issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding common stock. As such, we may instead rely on an exemption from the NYSE MKT stockholder approval rules which allows an NYSE MKT listed company an exemption from such rules when a delay in securing stockholder approval would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the company. Consequently, our stockholders may not be offered the ability to approve transactions we may undertake in the future, including those transactions which would ordinarily require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations, and/or those transactions which would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nIn the event we are unable to raise funding in the future or complete a business combination or similar transaction in the near term, we will not be able to pay our liabilities (some of which like the Letter Loan, are currently in default). In the event we are unable to raise adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations or in the event we fail to enter into a business combination or similar transaction, we would be forced to liquidate our assets (or our creditors may undertake a foreclosure of such assets in order to satisfy amounts we owe to such creditors) or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.\nWe are subject to production declines and loss of revenue due to shut-in wells.\nThe majority of our production revenues come from a small number of producing wells. In the event those wells are required to be shut-in (as they were for various periods during the twelve months ended March 31, 2015), our production and revenue could be adversely effected. Our wells are shut-in from time-to-time for maintenance, workovers, upgrades and other matters outside of our control, including repairs, adverse weather (including hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms). Any significant period where our wells, and especially our top producing wells, are shut-in, would have a material adverse effect on our results of production, revenues and net income or loss for the applicable period.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, cash flow, future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been very volatile, and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nseasonal variations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u00b7\nconsumer demand;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nvariations in levels of production;\n\u00b7\nregional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas; price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe completion of large domestic or international exploration and production projects;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on exportation of our oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, actions and taxes.\nFurther, oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Our revenue, profitability, and cash flow depend upon the prices of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, declines in commodity prices may:\n\u00b7\nnegatively impact the value of our reserves, because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the value and amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u00b7\nreduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other corporate purposes; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. If we expand our activities, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nWe face intense competition.\nWe are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies, drilling and income programs and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas. Many competitors are large, well-known energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry. Management believes that a viable marketplace exists for smaller producers of natural gas and crude oil.\nOur competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nWe currently owe significant funds under an outstanding promissory note, the repayment of which is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, which promissory note is currently in default.\nEffective on August 13, 2013, we entered into a Letter Loan Agreement with Louise H. Rogers, which was amended effective April 29, 2014, November 13, 2014 and February 23, 2015 (as amended to date, the \u201cLetter Loan\u201d). In connection with the Letter Loan and a Promissory Note entered into in connection therewith, Ms. Rogers loaned the Company $7.5 million (the \u201cLoan\u201c). Pursuant to the first amendment to the Letter Loan, interest only payments were due on the Loan during the first six months of the term and interest only payments were due during the period from April 13, 2014 through September 13, 2014 (during which six month period interest accrued at 15% per annum (compared to 12% per annum at all other times, except upon an event of default at which point the interest rate was to increase to 18% per annum)). Additionally, beginning on October 13, 2014, we were required to pay the monthly amortization payments (which total approximately $205,000 to $226,000, depending on the due date), as well as additional principal amortization payments of approximately $266,000 every three months (beginning October 13, 2014, and ending on July 13, 2015) until maturity (August 15, 2015), with approximately $3.87 million due on maturity. Pursuant to the second amendment to the Letter Loan, the principal payment in the amount of $428,327 which was originally due on November 13, 2014, was extended until December 13, 2014, as we were in the process of obtaining new financing, which new financing failed to close as a result of the subsequent precipitous decline in oil prices, and the interest rate of the loan was increased to 15% per annum. In connection with the third amendment to the Letter Loan, the parties agreed that the interest payments due for January, February and March 2015 (which January and February 2015 interest payments were not previously made by us) would be added to the principal amount of the promissory note and be due at maturity; and that interest only payments on the promissory note at the rate of 12% per annum (compared to 15% per annum pursuant to the second amendment to the Letter Loan, and 18% per annum as a result of various events of default which occurred under the loan documents prior to the parties\u2019 entry into the third amendment) would be due between April 2015 and August 2015 (compared to the terms of the second amendment to the Letter Loan, which required amortizing principal payments every month between December 2014 and August 2015 (which amortizing payments we failed to pay from December to February 2015)). We also currently have the right to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to September 13, 2015, by paying an extension fee of 2% of the remaining balance of the note on or before the current maturity date (August 13, 2015), and to thereafter further extend the maturity date of the promissory note to October 13, 2015, by paying an additional extension fee of 2% of the then remaining balance of the note on or before the September 13, 2015 extended maturity date.\nShould we opt to prepay the loan prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an exit fee equal to the advisory fees of approximately $15,000 per quarter that would have been due, had the note remained outstanding through maturity. During the term of the loan we are required to make mandatory prepayments of the Loan in the event the collateral securing the Loan does not meet certain thresholds and coverage ratios (as described in greater detail in such Letter Loan). The Letter Loan also provided the right for Ms. Rogers to designate an individual to attend and participate in our Board of Director\u2019s meetings in a non-official capacity. The Letter Loan includes customary and usual events of default and positive and negative covenants. The repayment of the Loan is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets which was evidenced by a Security Agreement and a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Assignment, Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Fixture Filing.\nWe failed to make the required May, June and July 2015 interest payments under the terms of the Letter Loan. Consequently, the amount owed under the Letter Loan of approximately $7.1 million will accrue at a default interest rate of 18% per annum moving forward. No further action has been taken by Rogers against us at this time in connection with such default and we are currently in negotiation with Rogers regarding new loan terms.\nAs of the date of this report, the loan is still outstanding and in default and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to make the required interest or principal payments on the Loan and/or to repay the Loan when due. In such case, the lender may seek to secure their interest pursuant to the aforementioned rights. Consequently, the value of our securities may decline in value. In the event an event of default occurs or continues under the Letter Loan, the lender can take certain actions under the Letter Loan, including demanding immediate repayment of all amounts then outstanding or initiating foreclosure proceedings against us. As the Letter Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, there is a risk that if the lender were to request the immediate repayment of the amounts outstanding and we did not have, and could not timely raise, funds to repay such obligations, that the lender (or where applicable, its agent) could foreclose on our assets which could cause us to significantly curtail or cease operations. If amounts outstanding under such Letter Loan were to be accelerated in the event of the occurrence of an event of default under the Letter Loan or the continuation thereof, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness and we may not be able to raise funds from alternative sources to repay such obligations on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. As such, the value of our securities may decline in value or become worthless in the event our lender accelerates the repayment of our outstanding obligations. Additionally, such defaults may harm our credit rating and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nOur loan agreement is currently in default and the future occurrence or continuance of an event of default under our loan agreement or the acceleration of amounts owed thereunder could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nThe loan agreement and note issued in connection there with include standard and customary events of default and are currently in default, provided our lender has not accelerated any amount due thereunder to date. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lender may declare the entire unpaid balance (as well as any interest, fees and expenses) immediately due and payable. Funding to repay such amounts, if required by our lender, may not be available timely, on favorable terms, if at all, and if our lender were to require immediate repayment of the amounts owed, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Specifically, applicable laws protecting endangered species prohibit the harming of endangered or threatened species, provide for habitat protection, and impose stringent penalties for noncompliance. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nThe derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, sets forth the new framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements, which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future. If these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic, our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.\nIn the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we may elect to use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nThe derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, sets forth the new framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements, which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future.\nIf these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic, our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The federal Clean Water Act, or CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In October 2011, the EPA announced its intention to develop federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the pretreatment rules will require coalbed methane and shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities Some states have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There has been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, the EPA study noted above has focused and will continue to focus on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, following the conclusion of the EPA\u2019s study, the agency will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties in the future, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, and may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. We may be unable to locate or make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated. Acquisitions involve risks that could divert management resources and/or result in the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations. For the reasons above, among others, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nIf we make any acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, funding permitting, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 assets, personnel and operations with our own. Additionally, acquisitions, mergers or business combinations we may enter into in the future could result in a change of control of the Company, and a change in the Board of Directors or officers of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25aa\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired companies, concepts and operations;\n\u25aa\nthe potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25aa\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25aa\nthe potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees;\n\u25aa\nour ability to successfully manage the companies and/or concepts acquired;\n\u25aa\nthe failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or\n\u25aa\nthe effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny acquisition or business combination transaction we enter into in the future could cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders, result in one party having majority or significant control over the Company or result in a change in business focus of the Company.\nWe depend significantly upon the continued involvement of our present management.\nWe depend to a significant degree upon the involvement of our management, specifically, our Chief Executive Officer and director, Anthony C. Schnur, who is in charge of our strategic planning and operations. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Schnur. We do not believe that Mr. Schnur could be quickly replaced with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and his successor(s) may not be as effective. If Mr. Schnur or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have an active Board of Directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in our business and the determination of our operational strategies. Members of our Board of Directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for further development. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our operations may be adversely affected.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nLeases on natural gas and oil properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation.\nAs many of our activities are subject to federal, state and local regulation, and as these rules are subject to constant change or amendment, our operations may be adversely affected by new or different government regulations, laws or court decisions applicable to our operations.\nGovernment regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, which may be changed from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and natural gas. There are federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of crude oil and natural gas, byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may inherit liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFuture increases in our tax obligations; either due to increases in taxes on energy products, energy service companies and exploration activities or reductions in currently available federal income tax deductions with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, may adversely affect our results of operations and increase our operating expenses.\nFederal, state and local governments have jurisdiction in areas where we operate and impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell. There are constant discussions by federal, state and local officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals, some of which, if passed, would add or increase taxes on energy products, service companies and exploration activities. Additionally, the current administration has proposed legislation which would make significant changes to federal tax laws, including the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These proposed changes include, but are not limited to: (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted into law or how soon any such changes could become effective in the event they were enacted into law. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could impact or increase the taxes that we are required to pay and consequently adversely affect our results of operations and/or increase our operating expenses.\nThe crude oil and natural gas reserves we report in our SEC filings are estimates and may prove to be inaccurate.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values. The reserves we report in our filings with the SEC now and in the future will only be estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of these uncertainties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs. Some or all of these assumptions may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material.\nAdditionally, \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible reserve estimates\u201d estimates are considered unproved reserves and as such, the SEC views such estimates to be inherently unreliable, may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not \u201cexperts\u201d in the oil or natural gas industry. Unless you have such expertise, you should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update this information and do not intend to update this information.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nCrude oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir, restoring wells to production and exploration, drilling and completing new wells are speculative activities and involve numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs.\nOur growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future development program. Even considering our business philosophy to avoid wildcat wells, drilling for crude oil and natural gas and reworking existing wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of exploration, drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inability to obtain leases on economic terms, where applicable; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment. Furthermore, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain rights to additional producing properties in the future and/or that any properties we obtain rights to will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil and/or gas.\nDrilling or reworking is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well completion techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling do not guarantee that we will find crude oil and/or natural gas in our wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid with or without particulates into a formation at high pressure, thereby creating fractures in the rock and leaving the particulates in the fractures to ensure that the fractures remain open, thereby potentially increasing the ability of the reservoir to produce oil or natural gas. Horizontal drilling involves drilling horizontally out from an existing vertical well bore, thereby potentially increasing the area and reach of the well bore that is in contact with the reservoir. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate and/or our drilling success rate for activities within a particular geographic area may decline in the future. We may identify and develop prospects through a number of methods, some of which do not include lateral drilling or hydraulic fracturing, and some of which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. Our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted prospects will be dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the results of previous development efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of data; the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants, if any, for the drilling of the prospects; the approval of the prospects by other participants, if any, after additional data has been compiled; economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for crude oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews; our financial resources and results; the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects; and the success of our drilling technology.\nThese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells discussed, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive crude oil or natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas in any properties we may acquire in the future, and/or we are unable to commercially extract such quantities we may find in any properties we may acquire in the future, the value of our securities may decline in value.\nBecause of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business operations, which could force us to expend a substantial amount of money in connection with litigation and/or a settlement.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by us in the future. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for the purchase of properties and/or property interests, exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties and/or force us to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. As such, our current insurance or the insurance that we obtain in the future may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify our purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. We may elect to self-insure if management believes that the cost of insurance, although available, is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, which could lead to any investment in us declining in value or becoming worthless.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases, associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.\nOur exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and natural gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSpecifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA\u2019s rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers to reduce GHG emissions.\nAdditionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the transportation and use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, air quality and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. Additional legislation or regulation could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing, cause operational delays, increase our operating costs or make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. New legislation or regulations in the future could have the effect of prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing, which would prevent us from completing our wells as planned and would have a material adverse effect on production from our wells. If these legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material delay or decrease in our drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, our business and profitability could be materially impacted.\nPossible regulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or have begun considering adopting greenhouse gas regulatory programs. At the federal level, Congress has considered legislation that could establish a cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The ultimate outcome of this federal legislative initiative remains uncertain. In addition to pending climate legislation, the EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as a first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Moreover, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gas emission from certain facilities pursuant to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the Clean Air Act. In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by government entities and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. Any existing or future laws or regulations that restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs. In addition, such laws and regulations may adversely affect demand for the fossil fuels we produce, including by increasing the cost of combusting fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the use of alternative fuels and energy.\nThe lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, insurance, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies tend to increase, in some cases substantially. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases within a geographic area. If increasing levels of exploration and production result in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. The future lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, as well as any future lack of availability or high costs of other equipment, supplies, insurance or qualified personnel, in the areas in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur officers and directors have limited liability, and we are required in certain instances to indemnify our officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties.\nWe have adopted provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws which limit the liability of our officers and directors and provide for indemnification by us of our officers and directors to the full extent permitted by Nevada corporate law. Our articles generally provide that our officers and directors shall have no personal liability to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors, except for breaches of their duties of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, acts involving unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit. Such provisions substantially limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty, and may require us to indemnify our officers and directors.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and in the future, we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf\na significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nany covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf\na high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u25cf\ndebt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur core properties are located in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford trends, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur core properties are located in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford trends south, and southeast of San Antonio, Texas. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the ones we operate in, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, which we may not have available when payments are due.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties, including under our current liabilities. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional securities. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able obtain such financing or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we may not be able to consummate an asset sale to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture Acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. There may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.\nWe have limited control over activities in properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues, affect the timing and amounts of capital requirements and potentially result in a dilution of our respective ownership interest in the event we are unable to make any required capital contributions.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs. For all of the properties that are operated by others, we are dependent on their decision-making with respect to day-to-day operations over which we have little control. The failure of an operator of wells in which we have an interest to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues we receive from that well. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the available expertise and financial resources, the inclusion of other participants and the use of technology. Since we do not own the majority interest in many of the wells we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of poor performance.\nThe employment agreement of our Chief Executive Officer includes certain provisions which may prevent or delay a change of control.\nEffective November 1, 2012, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Anthony C. Schnur, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, which agreement was amended and restated effective December 12, 2012. The agreement had a term of two years, expiring on October 31, 2014, provided that the agreement is automatically extended for additional one year terms, unless either party provides notice of their intent not to renew within the 30 day period prior to any automatic renewal date and because neither party provided notice during 2014, the agreement automatically extended until October 31, 2015. The Company agreed to pay Mr. Schnur a base annual salary of $310,000 during the term of the agreement, of which $290,000 is payable in cash and $20,000 is payable in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In the event the agreement is terminated by the Company for a reason other than cause (as described in the agreement) or by Mr. Schnur for good reason (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due in the form of a lump sum payment, the product of the base salary and bonus he was paid under the agreement for the prior 12 month period, provided that if such termination occurs six months before or 24 months following the occurrence of a Change of Control (as described in the agreement), Mr. Schnur is due 200% of the amount described above upon such termination. The requirement to pay severance fees under the Employment Agreement may prevent or delay a change of control of the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Outstanding Securities\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock currently is listed on the NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards. If we cannot meet the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements, the NYSE MKT may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.\nOn February 28, 2014, we received notice from the NYSE MKT, indicating we were below certain of the NYSE MKT\u2019s continued listing standards related to our existing financial resources or financial condition as set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. We were afforded the opportunity to submit a plan of compliance to the NYSE MKT, and on March 14, 2014, we submitted our plan to the NYSE MKT. On March 31, 2014, the NYSE MKT notified us that it had accepted our plan of compliance and granted us a conditional extension until April 14, 2014, which was subsequently extended until July 31, 2014, and again until October 31, 2014, December 4, 2014, January 31, 2015, March 31, 2015 and again until our 18-month maximum term of August 28, 2015, by which date the Company is required to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide and/or demonstrate adequate progress to that end. The Company will be subject to periodic review by the NYSE MKT during the extension period. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in us being delisted from the NYSE MKT.\nWe may be unable to comply with NYSE MKT continued listing standards. Our business has been and may continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as liquidity requirements of our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our market capitalization, revenue and operating results, which, in turn, affect our ability to comply with the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing standards. The NYSE MKT has the ability to suspend trading in our common stock or remove our common stock from listing on the NYSE MKT if in the opinion of the exchange: (a) the financial condition and/or operating results of the Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company; or (d) we have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the exchange; or (e) any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the NYSE MKT criteria for continued listing and are unable to regain compliance during any applicable cure periods, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE MKT might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE MKT and are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE MKT, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nour actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve estimates;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income/loss per share, net income/loss and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\npublic reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or other shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u25cf\ngeneral financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf\nthe realization of any of the risk factors that we are subject to;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \u201cLEI.\u201d Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our common stock. You should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nAdditionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if one develops, may not be sustained.\nA prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain additional financing which would adversely affect our operations.\nHistorically, we have relied on equity and debt financing as primary sources of financing. A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global markets may result in our inability to secure additional financing which would have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIf the holders of our outstanding convertible securities and warrants sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks after converting such convertible securities and exercising such warrants, or the holders of our registered shares sell a large number of shares, the trading value of our shares could decline in value.\nWe currently have Series B Warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 2,510,506 shares of common stock which have an exercise price of $2.86 per share; outstanding warrants to purchase 1,032,500 shares of common stock sold in April 2012, which have an exercise price of $2.30 per share; outstanding warrants to purchase 325,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share, which were issued in connection with our April and May 2013 loan agreements; outstanding warrants to purchase 279,851 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.35 per share, which were issued in connection with our August 2013 Letter Loan agreement; and outstanding warrants to purchase 1,666,666 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, which were issued in connection with our April 2014 offering. The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated between $0.70 and $0.06 per share during the last 52 weeks.\nWe currently have 500 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (herein the \u201cPreferred Stock Shares\u201d), which convert on a 1,000-for-one basis into shares of our common stock at the option of the holders thereof. Additionally, although the Preferred Stock Shares may not be converted if such conversion would cause the holder thereof to own more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock, this restriction does not prevent the holder from converting some of the Preferred Stock Shares, selling those shares and then converting the rest of its holdings, while still staying below the 4.99% limit. In this way, the holder could sell more than this limit while never actually holding more shares than this limit allows. As of the date of this report, if the 500 outstanding Preferred Stock Shares were converted into common stock and sold (subject to the ownership limitations set forth above) an additional 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company or approximately 1.4% of the Company\u2019s currently outstanding shares, would be issued and outstanding.\nWe have 36,354,973 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this report, which number does not take into account our 1:25 reverse stock split anticipated to take effect on July 15, 2015. As a result, the exercise of outstanding warrants or conversion of shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the future and the subsequent resale of such shares of common stock (which shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants, the warrants sold in our April and September 2012 offerings and the warrants sold in our April 2014 offering, will be eligible for immediate resale, and which shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and exercise of the warrants issued in April, May and August 2013, will be eligible for immediate resale subject to the terms and conditions of Rule 144) may cause dilution to existing shareholders and cause the market price of our securities to decline in value. Additionally, the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants or conversion of the Preferred Stock Shares may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a Company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of the Company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which shareholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. Finally, the offer or sale of large numbers of shares of common stock in the future, including those shares previously registered in our registration statements and prospectus supplements, and/or in connection with future registration statements or prospectus supplements may cause the market price of our securities to decline in value.\nThe Warrants sold in our April 2014 offering have anti-dilution and other rights which could cause substantial dilution to shareholders of the Company.\nThe exercise price (initially $1.00 per share) and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold in our April 2014 offering (initially 1,666,666 in aggregate) are automatically adjusted in the event of a forward or reverse stock split, our declaration of a stock dividend payable in shares of common stock or other securities or other property and reclassifications of common stock. Additionally, upon the occurrence of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other transaction involving us (except for Company Combinations as described below) in which our common stock is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property, we are required to make an appropriate provision (in form and substance satisfactory to the holders of the warrants) to ensure that the holders receive (or have the right to receive), in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) shares of common stock, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of common stock immediately acquirable and receivable upon exercise of the warrants had such transaction not taken place.\nThe warrants also include anti-dilution rights, which provide that if at any time the warrants are outstanding, we issue or are deemed to have issued (which includes shares issuable upon exercise of warrants and options and conversion of convertible securities) for consideration less than the then current exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of such warrants is automatically reduced (a) to the lowest price per share of consideration provided or deemed to have been provided for such securities, not to be deemed less than $0.01 per share, during the one year period following the closing date of the offering (April 21, 2014), which date has passed without any required adjustments; and thereafter (b) to the product of (x) the exercise price then in effect, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by us would purchase at the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of such additional shares of common stock issued. Notwithstanding the above, no adjustment of the exercise price is required in connection with any issuances or deemed issuance of shares of common stock (1) to our officers, directors, consultants or employees pursuant to stock option or stock purchase plans or agreements on terms approved by our Board of Directors, subject to adjustment for all subdivisions and combinations; and (2) in connection with the re-negotiation, modification, extension or re-pricing of debt of the Company outstanding on the closing date, subject to the prior written approval of the holders of the warrants. Additionally, in the event we acquire ownership of another entity or a significant amount of assets from another person or entity by way of an asset purchase agreement, merger (pursuant to which we are the surviving entity and our common stock is not converted or exchanged), business combination or share exchange pursuant to which shares of our common stock or convertible securities (including options or warrants) are issued or granted by us as partial or sole consideration to the counterparty or counterparties in such transaction or series of transactions (a \u201cCompany Combination\u201d), then and in such event, the exercise price of the warrants is automatically reduced, to the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices of our common stock averaged over the thirty (30) business days after the closing of the Company Combination if such exercise price as adjusted is less than the exercise price in effect on the date such Company Combination Price is determined.\nThe increase in number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants or decrease in the exercise price of such warrants, could, upon exercise of such warrants, cause significant dilution to existing shareholders and the sale of such shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants as adjusted could cause a decrease in the trading value of our common stock.\nWe may be forced to expend significant resources and pay significant costs and expenses associated with outstanding registration rights.\nIn connection with our entry into the April 2014 Securities Purchase Agreement, we provided the investors in the offering registration rights pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the purchasers in the April 2014 Securities Purchase Agreement have demand and piggy-back registration rights. We could be forced to expend significant resources and pay significant costs and expenses, including filing fees, legal fees and accounting fees, in connection with our compliance with the terms, conditions and requirements of such Registration Rights Agreement.\nNevada law and our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue shares of stock which shares may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWe have authorized capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of July 14, 2015, we have 36,354,973 shares of common stock outstanding, which number does not take into account our 1:25 reverse stock split anticipated to take effect on July 15, 2015, and 500 Preferred Stock Shares issued and outstanding, each convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock (prior to effecting the reverse stock split). As a result, our Board of Directors has the ability to issue a large number of additional shares of common stock without shareholder approval, subject to the requirements of the NYSE MKT (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), which if issued could cause substantial dilution to our then shareholders. Shares of additional preferred stock may also be issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval, with voting powers and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock shareholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock shareholders. Investors should keep in mind that the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have super voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred shareholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this report and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease and/or become worthless.\nShareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and/or satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nOn May 16, 2013 we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-188663), which allows us the ability to sell up to $10 million in securities from time to time in the future, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units consisting of any of the above. On May 24, 2013, the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC.\nOn September 6, 2013, the Company closed a registered direct offering under the Registration Statement of $3,451,500 (approximately $3.2 million net, after deducting commissions and other expenses) of shares of common stock to certain institutional investors. In total, the Company sold 2.95 million shares of common stock at a price of $1.17 per share.\nOn April 21, 2014, the Company closed a registered direct offering under the Registration Statement of $2,000,000 (approximately $1.88 million net, after deducting commissions and other expenses) of units to certain institutional investors. In total, the Company sold 3,333,332 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and 0.50 of one warrant to purchase one share of common stock.\nWe currently have no committed source of financing. Wherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock (subject to NYSE MKT rules which limit among other things, the number of shares we can issue without shareholder approval to no more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock). These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, and that dilution may be material.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, including sales of shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. In addition, holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they can, in effect, cover through the exercise of an option or warrant, thus locking in a profit. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. You could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and our shareholders may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in expectations of future financial performance; fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; issuances of dilutive common stock or other securities in the future; the addition or departure of key personnel; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and the increase or decline in the price of oil and natural gas.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of our common stock or resales in the open market will decrease the market price of our common stock. The impact of any such issuances or resales of our common stock on our market price may be increased as a result of the fact that our common stock is thinly, or infrequently, traded. The exercise of any options that we have or that we may grant to directors, executive officers and other employees in the future, the issuance of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock (including shares previously registered in our registration statements and prospectus supplements, and/or in connection with future registration statements or prospectus supplements) could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing shareholders. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.\nWe face potential liability in the event we do not satisfy the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, prior to the date the Series B Warrants and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise thereof have been sold by the holders thereof or have expired.\nPursuant to an agreement entered into with the Series B Warrant holders, we agreed that if at any time prior to the date that all of the Series B Warrants and any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants are sold by the holders thereof, we fail to satisfy the current public information requirement of Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (a \u201cPublic Information Failure\u201d), as partial relief for the damages to any holder of warrants, we would pay the holders, based on their pro rata ownership of non-exercised and non-expired warrants on the first day of a Public Information Failure, an aggregate of $80,000 for the first thirty calendar days that there is a Public Information Failure (pro-rated for a period of less than thirty days) and an amount in cash equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Black Scholes Value (as defined in the warrants) of such holder\u2019s non-exercised and non-expired warrants on the sixty-first (61st) calendar day after the Public Information Failure (covering the 31st to 60th calendar days) and on every thirtieth day (pro-rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date such Public Information Failure is cured; (ii) such time that such public information is no longer required pursuant to Rule 144; and (iii) the expiration date of the warrants. Additionally, upon the occurrence of any Public Information Failure during the 12 months prior to the expiration of any warrant, the expiration date of such warrant will be automatically extended for one day for each day that a Public Information Failure occurs and is continuing. As such, in the event of the occurrence of a Public Information Failure, we will face liability and penalties.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a fully reporting publicly traded company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a fully reporting public company. Specifically, we are required to prepare and file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Additionally, our officers, directors and significant shareholders are required to file Form 3, 4 and 5\u2019s and Schedule 13D/G\u2019s with the SEC disclosing their ownership of the Company and changes in such ownership. Furthermore, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. The costs and expenses of compliance with SEC rules and our filing obligations with the SEC, or our identification of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause the market price of our stock to decline in value.\nSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our cost and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the SEC that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require the approval of the NYSE MKT for such transactions and/or NYSE MKT rules may require us to obtain shareholder approval for such transactions.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nWe may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We may not be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering or other transactions at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering.\nRisks Relating to Our Planned 1-for-25 Reverse Stock Split\nOur total market capitalization after the reverse stock split may not be equal to or greater than our total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and the per share market price of our common stock following the reverse stock split may not equal or exceed the current per share market price.\nAs described in greater detail above under \u201cPart I\u201d - \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - \u201cGeneral\u201d - \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d, pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Company\u2019s March 25, 2015 annual meeting, and in order to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT, the Board of Directors approved the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of all outstanding common stock shares of the Company, anticipated to be effective on July 15, 2015. The market price per share of our common stock after the reverse stock split may not increase in proportion to the reverse stock split. The market price of our common stock will be based on our performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. If our market price declines after affecting the reverse stock split, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the reverse stock split. In some cases, both the total market capitalization of a company and the market price of a share of such company\u2019s common stock following a reverse stock split are lower than they were before the reverse stock split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after the reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and, in the future, the market price of our common stock following the reverse stock split may not equal or exceed the market price prior to the proposed reverse stock split. Furthermore, the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split and the reduction in number of shares in our public float.", "PERMNO": 92571, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CEI"}
