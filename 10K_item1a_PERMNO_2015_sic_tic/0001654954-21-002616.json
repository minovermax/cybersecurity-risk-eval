{"cik": "875355", "company": "INSIGNIA SYSTEMS INC/MN", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to many risks. The following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance.\nCOMPETITIVE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe face significant competition from News America, the primary provider of at-shelf advertising and promotional signage for a significant majority of retailers. We continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater market presence and financial resources that can be used to market their products and purchase exclusive access to retailers and CPG manufacturers. Should our competition succeed in obtaining more of the at-shelf advertising business from our current CPG manufacturers, develop or extend exclusive relationships with our current retailers, our revenues and related operations would be adversely affected.\nWe also compete against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, and providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store solutions, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, store coverage and other factors. The increasing popularity of digital media among consumers is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional in-store tactics to digital. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for in-store advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure, which would have an adverse effect on sales and our financial results.\nOur Results May Be Dependent on Our CPG Manufacturers\u2019 Continued Use of Our POPS Solution\nSince late 2018, we have seen changes in the CPG manufacturers who participate in our solutions that have adversely impacted POPS sales, through CPG manufacturers both forgoing new contracts and reducing forward participation. We also have seen increased competitive activities that are expected to lead to further decreases in POPS sales. In addition, volatility in CPG manufacturer spend has resulted from shrinking advertising budgets, expanded product solutions, and increased competition.\nWhile our dependence on POPS sales has declined over the last several years, POPS sales were still 44% of our total net sales in 2020. Further declines in our POPS sales would cause our business and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nThe Viability of Our POPS Solution and Our Results Are Dependent on Our Ongoing Business Relationships with Retailers\nTo execute our POPS solution, we have entered into arrangements with retailers that provide us with access to place signs on shelves in their stores for our CPG manufacturing customers. We have also accessed a portion of our retailer relationships through third parties. During 2020, our top three retailer relationships provided distribution for 16% of our total net sales.\nA significant retailer exited our retailer network in the first half of 2019. The impacts of the loss of this retailer is reflected in our results for 2019 and 2020. Our ability to sell our in-store solutions is substantially dependent on the quantity and quality of the retailer locations in our network.\nOur retailer contracts generally have terms of one to three years and we are negotiating the renewal of these contracts on an ongoing basis. The future renewal of these contracts on profitable terms is not free from doubt. Some of our retailer contracts require us to guarantee minimum payments and we may be unable to profitably perform under these fixed cost contracts, or to offer a guarantee at the level required by a retailer during renewal negotiations. Further decreases in the size or quality of our retail distribution network, would have an adverse effect on sales of our in-store signage solutions and our financial results.\nWe Have Been, and Are, Party to Significant Litigation\nWe monitor the competitive practices of those in our industry for fairness which may lead to disputes that could have adverse effects on our Company or its business. We were involved in significant litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. In 2011, we and News America entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years.\nIn July 2019, we brought suit against News America in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, alleging violations of federal and state antitrust and tortious interference laws by News America. The complaint alleges that News America has monopolized the relevant market through various wrongful acts designed to harm the Company, its last significant competitor, in the third-party in-store advertising and promotion products and services market. The suit seeks, among other relief, an injunction sufficient to prevent further antitrust injury and an award of treble damages to be determined at trial for the harm caused to our Company. For further description of our legal proceedings, see Item 3 in Part I of this report.\nWe cannot be assured that we will succeed in asserting our claims or, if we are successful, that our recovery (if any) will be adequate to cover the damages incurred and our costs of recovery. It is also possible that we may be unsuccessful in defending against any counterclaims, that a judgement will not be entered against us or that reserves (if any) we may set aside will be adequate to cover any such judgments. In addition, we have incurred significant expenses during the litigation and expect to incur significant expenses in the future, while recovery is uncertain or pending.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur Growth Is Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Develop and Introduce New Solution Offerings that Meet Client Demands\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful new products and the ability to secure and maintain access to retailer locations that are appealing to CPG manufacturers. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful or have the necessary scale to be profitable.\nRISKS RELATED TO ECONOMY AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nCPG Manufacturers and Retailers May Be Disproportionately Impacted by Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by CPG manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending and our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions inclusive of the dynamic global trade environment. Another economic downturn, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Retailers may be impacted by changes in consumer spending as well, which may adversely impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing retailers as well as contract with new retailers on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nCurrent and Future Pandemics Are Likely to Impact Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely impacted our operations and the operations of our CPG customers and retailers as a result of quarantines, illnesses, and travel and logistics restrictions and it is likely to continue to adversely affect our business indefinitely. Our future bookings may be negatively impacted until the COVID-19 pandemic moderates. Factors deriving from the COVID-19 response that have impacted or we believe are likely to negatively impact sales and operating results in the future include, but are not limited to: reduced or delayed levels of CPG spending; reduced levels of staffing with our execution partners; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Because we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, the financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Key Employees Is Critical to Our Success\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Outsourcing Arrangements May Not Yield the Desired Efficiencies Within Our Planned Timeline, If At All\nWe have recently entered into arrangements with third parties for them to operate certain software applications and significant portions of our information technology infrastructure, as well as most of our printing operations that are necessary to conduct our in-store signage business. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of these third parties, but we may not be successful in managing these relationships to achieve the desired outcomes.\nThese outsourcing arrangements make us reliant on third parties to conduct our operations and to satisfy commitments to customers. We are vulnerable to third party failures to satisfy their obligations to us for any reason, including as a result of their nonperformance, performance at standards that are not acceptable to us or our customers, changes in their methods of operation or financial condition, and other matters outside of our control. Further, we may not fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing projects or other relationships we entered into with these third parties, which could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems for the Company.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur Results of Operations Have Been and May Be Subject to Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u25cf the addition or loss of contracts with retailers;\n\u25cf the addition or loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u25cf the timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u25cf the timing of new retail stores being added or removed;\n\u25cf costs of evaluating and developing new products, and customers accepting new products;\n\u25cf the timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u25cf competitive conditions in our industry.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2020, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a low of $3.78 to a high of $12.25. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISKS\nWe May be Impacted if Our Information Systems Are Attacked\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, both internal and outsourced, in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Insignia and its employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats-from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data-are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and products and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain. Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs. Should such an attack succeed, it could expose us and our employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
