RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\n\u25cf The effect of the pendency of the proposed merger on our business and results of operations\n\u25cf Failure to complete the proposed merger\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity\n\u25cf Loss of third-party distribution agents\n\u25cf Inadequacy of loss reserve estimates\n\u25cf Ineffectiveness of risk management policies\n\u25cf The occurrence of technology breaches or failures of information technology systems\n\u25cf Adverse changes in the economy\n\u25cf Access to capital and market liquidity\n\u25cf Our inability to start up or integrate new product opportunities\n\u25cf Cyclical changes in the insurance industry\n\u25cf Our ability to compete effectively\n\u25cf A downgrade in our financial strength ratings from A.M.

The transaction is subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\nThere are numerous risks related to the proposed transaction, including the following:\n\u25cf we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses in connection with the proposed transaction, which could prove to be significant;\n\u25cf our business and our operating and financial results may be materially adversely affected by the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention and the expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger;\n\u25cf existing and potential legal proceedings may be instituted against us following announcement of the transaction that may delay the transaction, make it more costly or ultimately preclude it\u037e\n\u25cf the risk that the parties will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals, or the possibility that they may delay the transaction or that materially burdensome or adverse regulatory conditions may be imposed in connection with any such regulatory approvals\u037e\n\u25cf the Merger Agreement contains certain restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions\u037e\n\u25cf the proposed transaction may impact the continued availability of capital and financing to us before, or in the absence of, the consummation of the transaction\u037e\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws or regulations could impact the transaction\u037e and\n\u25cf disruptions and uncertainty relating to the transaction, whether or not it is completed, may harm our relationships with our employees (both current and prospective), customers, distributors, vendors or other business partners, and may result in a negative impact on our business.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire us prior to the completion of the proposed merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain customary provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, alternative acquisition proposals from third parties prior to the completion of the proposed merger. The Merger Agreement entitles Parent to receive a termination fee of $23,435,669 plus enforcement costs and up to $5,000,000 of transaction expenses of Parent and Pedal Merger Sub, Inc. from us if (a) the Merger Agreement is terminated on account of having reached the end date, January 12, 2022, and within six months of termination we enter into or consummate an acquisition proposal for 50% or more of the our assets or equity that was publicly known before the termination; (b) we breached or failed to perform any of our representations, warranties, covenants or other conditions to the proposed merger, including with respect to our \u201cno shop\u201d and related covenants; or (c) we terminated the Merger Agreement because its Board of Directors determined, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a third-party Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). These provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of us, even one that may be of greater value to our stockholders than the proposed merger. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, our obligation to reimburse Parent for transaction expenses may result in that third party offering a lower value to our stockholders than the third party might otherwise have offered.\nFailure to complete the proposed merger could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nThe completion of the proposed merger is subject to closing conditions, such as approval by regulatory authorities. These regulatory approvals include, among others: (i) approvals from the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions and the New York State Department of Financial Services with respect to Parent\u2019s applications for the acquisition of control with respect to our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the relevant state; (ii) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; (iii) the conclusion of a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pursuant to Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, including the regulations promulgated thereunder, codified at 31 C.F.R. Part 800, et seq.; and (iv) approvals required for the implementation of the adverse development cover and loss portfolio transfer transaction contemplated under the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or that the proposed merger will otherwise occur.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including that:\n\u25cf we do not receive a termination fee from Parent after it terminates the Merger Agreement because the regulatory approvals are conditioned on the imposition of materially burdensome conditions, which, under the Merger Agreement, Parent and its affiliates are not required to accept;\n\u25cf customers, agents or other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about our future and seek alternative relationships with other parties or seek to alter their business relationships with us\u037e\n\u25cf our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel\u037e\n\u25cf we expect to incur transaction costs in connection with the proposed merger regardless of whether the proposed merger is completed, and such costs could prove to be significant\u037e\n\u25cf we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the proposed merger\u037e and\n\u25cf if the Merger Agreement is terminated and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire us at a price of $12.85 per share or higher and on other terms acceptable to us, the market price of our shares of common stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nBeginning in March 2020, the pandemic related to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 began to impact the global economy. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 could include, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf Revenues. The impact of COVID-19 on general economic activity has negatively impacted our premium volumes in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, and may continue to negatively impact our premium volumes to a degree that will vary based on the extent and duration of any economic contraction or related behavioral changes.\n\u25cf Adverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address the impact of COVID-19 may continue to adversely affect us. We may become subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that retroactively mandates coverage for losses that our insurance policies were not intended or priced to cover, including business interruption claims, despite terms included in our policies to preclude coverage or that creates presumptions of compensability not otherwise present (including for example in workers\u2019 compensation exposures). Regulatory requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel policies, collect premiums, or requiring us to refund premiums in a manner not otherwise required.\n\u25cf Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses. We may incur higher claims and claim adjustment expenses in certain lines of business due to increases in claims frequency and/or severity. Short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19 could impact our various product lines in ways we cannot adequately predict.\n\u25cf Losses and Loss Reserves. Anticipated and unknown risks related to COVID-19 may cause uncertainty in the process of estimating losses and loss reserves. As a result, our estimated loss reserves may change. Higher inflation than anticipated could lead to an increase in our loss costs and a need to strengthen loss reserves. Such impacts could be more pronounced for those lines of business requiring a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims.\n\u25cf Investments. The value of corporate, municipal and structured securities (including mortgage-backed securities) in our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted by ratings downgrades, government deficits, increased bankruptcies, credit spread widening, and real estate market disruption/devaluation, or could be subject to impairment as a result of issuer creditworthiness deterioration, default, and/or interest rate increases. Further disruption in global financial markets due to the continuing pandemic could result in net realized investment losses.\n\u25cf Operational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of management, a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforce of certain third parties (including our agents, brokers or service providers) are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. The interruption of system capabilities for our agents, brokers or service providers could result in deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions, and the shift to remote work arrangements by us, our business partners, and our service providers could heighten the risk of cybersecurity or data security incidents.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. or global economy or adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood or magnitude of the other risks described in the Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThird-party agents we rely upon to distribute certain business on our behalf may be acquired or terminate their agreements with us, or may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough we distribute our products through a variety of distribution channels, our distribution strategy is primarily focused on key agents. Our distribution model therefore relies partially upon the expertise, creditworthiness and performance of certain of our key agents. Several of these agents are responsible for a significant portion of the premium written by us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top three MGUs distributed 33.7% of our insurance by GWP from customer segments. While this model provides many benefits to us and our customers, such agents have in the past, and may in the future elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us as a result of industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, developments in legislation or regulation that affect our business, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. In January 2019, Midlands Management Corporation (\u201cMidlands\u201d), an MGU for the Self-Insured Groups niches, was acquired by a third-party insurance carrier. In 2020, we wrote no GWP through Midlands and $69.1 million of GWP in 2019. We seek to mitigate these risks in part through our contractual relationships with these agents, including in our MGU agreements, which in most cases have us retaining control over our intellectual property and maintaining the right to either exclusively pursue or to compete directly for our customers if an MGU terminates their relationship with us. In each case, we maintain the right to compete more generally in the niche. Nevertheless, an interruption in certain key relationships could cause operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), a loss of business and increased costs or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our agents may fail to perform as anticipated or adhere to their obligations to us. Although our agents are subject to stringent guidelines, limited underwriting authority, ongoing oversight by our employees and monitoring through regular audits and other procedures, which have in the past enabled us to detect and remedy incidents of non-adherence, our efforts may not be adequate to prevent or detect such breaches. If our agents materially exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us and we are unable to timely identify and remedy such breaches, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual insured losses, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nSignificant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expense (\u201cLAE\u201d). Loss reserves are estimates of the ultimate cost of claims and do not represent a precise calculation of any ultimate liability. These estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency and severity of claims that may be reported in the future. Estimating loss reserves is a difficult, complex and inherently uncertain process involving many variables and subjective judgments. As part of the reserving process, we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors such as:\n\u25cf loss emergence and cedant reporting patterns;\n\u25cf underlying policy terms and conditions;\n\u25cf business and exposure mix;\n\u25cf trends in claim frequency and severity;\n\u25cf changes in operations;\n\u25cf emerging economic and social trends;\n\u25cf inflation; and\n\u25cf changes in the regulatory and litigation environments.\nThis process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. It also assumes that adequate historical or other data exists upon which to make these judgments. For more information on the estimates used in the establishment of loss reserves, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2009-\u2009Critical Accounting Policies \u2009-\u2009Reserves for unpaid losses and LAE on this Annual Report. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates, perhaps materially. Some of our reserves were established for exposure to liabilities acquired through our acquisition of New York Marine and General Insurance Company, Inc., a specialty commercial insurance company, in 2010. These liabilities were not subject to our highly structured underwriting process, include asbestos, environmental and products liabilities and are subject to similar risks and uncertainties as P&C risks underwritten by us after the acquisition, including difficulties of estimating loss reserves, pricing risk and pricing reinsurance. The net loss reserves related to accident years 2011 and prior were $75.8 million as of December 31, 2020 or 5.3% of our total net loss reserves. If the actual amount of insured losses is greater than the amount we have reserved for these losses, our profitability could suffer.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or results of operations.\nWe have developed and continue to develop enterprise-wide risk management policies and procedures to mitigate risk and loss to which we are exposed. There are, however, inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management policies and procedures are ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our business changes and the niches in which we operate evolve, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. As a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience, the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses to us. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will follow our risk management policies and procedures.\nMoreover, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d) and state legislatures and regulators have increased their focus on risks within an insurer\u2019s holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to insurers. The NY DFS, the primary regulator of New York Marine and Gotham, has adopted regulations implementing a requirement under the New York Insurance Law for insurance holding companies to adopt a formal enterprise risk management (\u201cERM\u201d) function and to file an annual enterprise risk report. NY DFS regulation also requires domestic insurers to conduct an own risk and solvency assessment (\u201cORSA\u201d) and to submit an ORSA summary report prepared in accordance with the NAIC\u2019s ORSA Guidance Manual. In addition, the Company and Southwest Marine, whose primary regulator is the AZ DOI, are subject to similar ERM and ORSA requirements. We operate within an ERM framework designed to assess and monitor our risks. However, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor\nall risks, or that all of our employees will operate within the ERM framework or that our ERM framework will result in us accurately identifying all risks and accurately limiting our exposures based on our assessments.\nTechnology breaches or failures of our or our business partners\u2019 systems, including but not limited to cybersecurity incidents, could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information, which could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and those of our business partners or service providers to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we and our business partners and service providers employ measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of information technology networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Security breaches could expose us to litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could affect our operations. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent every type of cyber-attack. A significant cybersecurity incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, any or all of which could be material. It is possible that insurance coverage we have in place would not entirely protect us in the event that we experienced a cybersecurity incident, interruption or widespread failure of our information technology systems.\nAdverse changes in the economy could lower the demand for our insurance products and could have an adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of our operations.\nFactors such as business revenue, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation can all affect the business and economic environment. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. Insurance premiums in our markets are heavily dependent on variables such as our customer revenues, values transported, miles traveled and number of new projects initiated. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment and reduced corporate revenues, the demand for insurance products is adversely affected. Adverse changes in the economy may lead our customers to have less need for insurance coverage, to cancel existing insurance policies, to modify coverage or to not renew with us, all of which affect our ability to generate revenue.\nAccess to capital and market liquidity may adversely affect our ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise and to fund our operations in a cost-effective manner.\nOur ability to grow our business, either organically or through acquisitions, depends in part on our ability to access capital when needed. We cannot predict capital market liquidity or the availability of capital. We also cannot predict the extent and duration of future economic and market disruptions, the impact of government interventions into the market to address these disruptions and their combined impact on our industry, business and investment portfolios. If we need capital but cannot raise it, our business and future growth could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively start up or integrate new product opportunities.\nOur ability to grow our business depends, in part, on our creation, implementation and acquisition of new insurance products that are profitable and fit within our business model. New product launches as well as resources to integrate business acquisitions are subject to many obstacles, including ensuring we have sufficient business and systems processes, determining appropriate pricing, obtaining reinsurance, assessing opportunity costs and regulatory burdens and planning for internal infrastructure needs. If we cannot accurately assess and overcome these obstacles or we improperly implement new insurance products, our ability to grow profitably will be impaired.\nOur results of operations and revenues may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nThe results of operations of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand, pricing and overall profitability, causing cyclical performance in the insurance industry. These cycles are characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permit more favorable pricing. Among our competitive strengths have been our specialty product focus and our niche market strategy. In periods of intense competition, these strengths also expose us to actions by other, especially larger, insurance companies who seek to write additional premiums without appropriate regard for underwriting profitability. During weak markets characterized by lower prices, it may be difficult for us to grow or maintain premium volume levels without sacrificing underwriting profits. If we are not successful in maintaining rates or achieving rate increases, it may be difficult for us to improve or maintain underwriting profits or to grow or maintain premium volume levels. In addition, our overall profitability can be affected significantly by:\n\u25cf rising levels of loss costs that we cannot anticipate at the time we price our coverages;\n\u25cf volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks;\n\u25cf changes in the level of available reinsurance;\n\u25cf changes in the amount of losses resulting from new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers\u2019 liabilities; and\n\u25cf the ability of our underwriters to accurately select and price risk and of our claim personnel to appropriately deliver fair outcomes.\nFurthermore, the demand for our insurance products across our customer segments can vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases, causing our revenues to fluctuate. These fluctuations in results of operations and revenues may not reflect our long-term results and may cause the price of our securities to be volatile.\nWe compete with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues.\nWe compete with a large number of other companies in our customer segments. During periods of intense competition for premium, we are exposed to the actions of other companies who may seek to write policies without the appropriate regard for risk and profitability. During these times, it is very difficult to grow or maintain premium volume without sacrificing underwriting discipline and income.\nWe face competition from a wide range of both from specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and intermediaries, as well as diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than we are and that have significantly greater financial, marketing, management and other resources. Some of these competitors also have greater market recognition and experience than we do. We may incur increased costs in competing for underwriting revenues. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or expand our operations into new markets, our underwriting revenues may decline, as well as overall business results.\nWe focus on providing specialized products and services in our various niches, and we believe that the diversity and uniqueness of our business model inherently provides a certain degree of shelter from competition. However, as we continue to grow our market share within each niche, the risk of competition within that niche grows as our larger competitors tend to focus on obtaining business at scale (as opposed to at the individual customer level). We seek to mitigate this risk, and the risk of competition generally, in part by building contractual protections into our distributor relationships. For example, in most cases we retain control over our intellectual property and have the right either to\nexclusively pursue our customers or to compete directly with our former MGU if they terminate their relationships with us. In each case, we maintain the right to compete more generally in the niche. However, there can be no assurance that our risk mitigation strategies will be effective.\nA number of new, proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments include:\n\u25cf programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other \u201calternative markets\u201d types of coverage;\n\u25cf changing practices, which may lead to greater competition in the insurance business; and\n\u25cf the emergence of insurtech companies and the development of new technologies, which may lead to disruption of current business models and the insurance value chain.\nNew competition from these developments could cause the supply and/or demand for our insurance products to change, which could affect our ability to price our coverages at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results.\nA downgrade in our Financial Strength Ratings (\u201cFSRs\u201d) from A.M. Best could negatively affect our results of operations.\nFSRs are a critical factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our insurance companies are rated for overall financial strength by A.M. Best. These FSRs reflect A.M. Best\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. Our FSRs are subject to periodic review by such firms, and the criteria used in the rating methodologies is subject to change; as such, we cannot assure the continued maintenance of our current FSRs. All of our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 FSRs were reviewed during 2020 and were reaffirmed at a rating of\u2009 \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent). In 2017, A.M. Best downgraded its \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) FSRs to \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) for our insurance subsidiaries. Because FSRs have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies, if our FSRs are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, our competitive position in the industry, and therefore our business, could be adversely affected. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business, as policyholders might move to other companies with higher FSRs.\nOur results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and FSRs are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events.\nEvents such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, solar storms, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyber-crimes, product defects, mass torts and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. Such catastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could expose us to:\n\u25cf widespread claim costs associated with property and workers\u2019 compensation claims;\n\u25cf losses resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;\n\u25cf losses resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;\n\u25cf declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties with whom we transact business to whom we have credit exposure, including reinsurers, and declines in the value of investments; and\n\u25cf significant interruptions to our systems and operations.\nNatural and man-made catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. While we have structured our business and selected our niches in part to avoid catastrophic losses, our exposure to such losses depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentrations of insured companies and individuals. Vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes could require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated catastrophe claims.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and economic, legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;\n\u25cf plaintiffs targeting P&C insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;\n\u25cf medical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims; and\n\u25cf claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies, including cyber-security related risks and claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions.\nIn some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued.\nIn addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nConcentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures to factors such as exposure type, industry, geographic region, customer and other factors. We also seek to use reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain. In certain circumstances, however, these risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. Also, our exposure for certain single risk coverages and other coverages may be so large that losses could exceed our expectations and could have a potentially material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.\nNegative developments in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we engage in other businesses, approximately 8.9% of our GWP are currently attributable to workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies providing both primary and excess coverage. As a result, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In certain states in which we do business, insurance regulators set the premium rates we may charge, which has the potential to restrict our profits. In addition, if one of our larger markets were to enact legislation to increase the scope or amount of benefits for employees under workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies without related premium increases or loss control measures, this could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal climate change may in the future increase the frequency and severity of weather events and resulting losses, particularly to the extent our policies are concentrated in geographic areas where such events occur, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nScientific evidence indicates that manmade production of greenhouse gas has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the global climate. There is a growing consensus today that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and, in recent years, the frequency of extreme weather events appears to have increased. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by natural events, such as wild fires, severe tropical storms and hurricanes, will affect our ability to write new insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, but, to the extent our policies are concentrated in the specific geographic areas in which these events occur, the increased frequency and severity of such events and the total amount of our loss exposure in the impacted areas of such events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although we have historically had limited exposure to catastrophic risk, claims from catastrophe events could reduce our earnings and cause substantial volatility in our business, results of operations and financial condition for any period. However, assessing the risk of loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and the range of approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including impacts related to extreme weather events and slow onset events, remains a challenge and might adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to losses from acts of terrorism as we are required by law to provide certain coverage for such losses.\nU.S. insurers are required by state and federal law to offer coverage for acts of terrorism in certain commercial lines, including workers\u2019 compensation. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (\u201cTRIPRA\u201d) requires commercial property and casualty insurance companies to offer coverage for acts of terrorism, whether foreign or domestic, and established a federal assistance program through the end of 2027 to help cover claims related to future terrorism-related losses. The likelihood and impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature, extent, location and timing of such an act. Although we reinsure a portion of the terrorism risk we retain under TRIPRA, our terrorism reinsurance does not provide full coverage for an act stemming from nuclear, biological or chemical terrorism. To the extent an act of terrorism, whether a domestic or foreign act, is certified by the Secretary of Treasury, we may be covered under TRIPRA of our losses for certain P&C lines of insurance. However, any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20% of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2020 earned premiums, our aggregate deductible under TRIPRA during 2021 is approximately $113.7 million. The federal government will then reimburse us for losses in excess of our deductible, 80 percent in 2021, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion.\nOur ultimate financial obligations to the buyers of our U.K. operations may be greater than expected, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs part of the 2017 sale transaction to divest our U.K.-based Lloyd\u2019s of London business, which was placed in run-off in June of 2017, we retained three ongoing financial obligations. We: (i) committed to fund Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1110\u2019s \u201cFunds at Lloyd\u2019s\u201d requirements until June 30, 2020 (the \u201cFAL Obligation\u201d); however, due to a contractual dispute with respect to the substituting the Funds at Lloyd\u2019s, the FAL Obligation commitment did not terminate on June 30, 2020, (ii) entered a 100% Quota Share reinsurance agreement as reinsurer, covering U.S.-sourced business written by Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1110, and (iii) entered into Aggregate Stop Loss and 100% Quota Share reinsurance agreements as reinsurer on U.K.-sourced business, with Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1110 as our reinsured, the effect of which was that we absorb syndicate losses on U.K.-originated business above a threshold equivalent to the stated reserves at the time of the sale (the \u201cU.K. Obligations\u201d) and collateralize the reserves relating to such business.\nWe undertook each of these obligations with an estimated quantified exposure and an expectation that the exposure would decrease over time and based on our FAL Obligation contractually terminating on June 30, 2020, at which time the process of releasing our assets posted as Funds at Lloyd\u2019s is to take place. The FAL Obligation was expected to terminate by June 30, 2020. However, the buyer disputed its contractual obligation with respect to substituting our Funds at Lloyd\u2019s at that time. In February 2021, a U.K. court granted summary judgment in our favor requiring the buyer to substitute our Funds at Lloyd\u2019s: however, such judgment is subject to appeal by the buyer. There is no assurance, however, that prior to that time the amount of the FAL Obligation will not increase by an amount greater than we expect or that the process of releasing those assets once our FAL Obligation terminates will not take longer than we expect. Similarly, there is no assurance that our ultimate exposure on the U.K. Obligations, will not be greater than expected due to more significant losses in the U.K. business. The impact of such an increase, or a dispute with Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1110 over the calculation of that amount or on other matters, could cause our exposure under the U.K. Obligations to be greater than expected or the payment/release of collateral to us to occur later or in an amount that is lower than expected. The process of establishing reserves and related LAE is based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency and severity of claims that may be reported in the future. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. It also assumes that adequate historical or other data exists upon which to make these judgments. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves or other estimates, and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates, perhaps materially. If the actual time periods and amounts of losses are greater than the amounts we have reserved for and expect, our profitability could be adversely affected. To be updated.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to limit our loss exposure in a variety of ways, including adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones, limiting niche size for each customer, establishing per-risk and per-occurrence limitations for each event, employing coverage restrictions and generally following prudent underwriting guidelines for each niche written. We also seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic and market niche diversification. Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more future events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a potentially material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we seek to limit loss exposures by policy terms, exclusion from coverage and choice of legal forum. However, disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum also arise. As a result, various provisions of our policies, such as choice of legal forum, limitations or exclusions from coverage may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, or at all, and some or all of our loss limitation methods may prove ineffective.\nPricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate losses, including the models that we use to do so. Given the inherent uncertainty of models, the usefulness of such models as a tool to evaluate risks is subject to a high degree of uncertainty that could result in actual losses that are materially different than our estimates, which may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe seek to price our insurance products such that insurance premiums, policy fees and charges, and future net investment income earned on revenues received will result in an acceptable profit in excess of expenses and the cost of paying claims. Our business is dependent on our ability to price our products effectively and charge appropriate premiums. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including proper evaluation of insurance risks, our expense levels, net investment income realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes. Inadequate pricing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely on estimates of loss for certain events that are generated by computer-run models. We use these models to help us control risk accumulation, inform management and other stakeholders of capital requirements and to improve the risk-adjusted return profile or minimize the amount of capital required to cover the risks in each of our written policies. However, given the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of these techniques, these models and databases may not accurately address a variety of matters which might affect certain of our policies.\nSmall changes in assumptions, which depend heavily on our expertise, judgment and foresight, can have a significant impact on modeled outputs. For example, although we have limited catastrophic loss exposure, we use catastrophe models that simulate loss estimates based on a set of assumptions. These assumptions address a number of factors that impact loss potential. We run many model simulations in order to understand the impact of these assumptions on a catastrophe\u2019s loss potential, but there can be no assurance that our models will accurately predict catastrophic loss levels.\nAs a result of these factors, our reliance on estimates, models, data, assumptions and scenarios used to evaluate our entire risk portfolio may not produce accurate predictions. Consequently, we could incur losses both in the risks we underwrite and to the value of our investment portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nReinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could be material.\nOur subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. While reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to them for the reinsured portion of the risk. For this reason, reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance risk retention and to mitigate losses from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control may impact the availability and cost of reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. We may, at certain times, be forced to incur additional costs for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. In the latter case, we would have to accept an increase in exposure to risk, reduce the amount of business written by our insurance subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the use of reinsurance placed in the capital markets, may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions. Any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in these markets, such as following a major catastrophic event, may limit our ability to access such markets on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, to the extent that we intend to use structures based on an industry loss index or other non-indemnity trigger rather than on actual losses incurred by us, we could be subject to residual risk.\nRetentions in various lines of business expose us to potential losses.\nWe retain risk for our own account on business underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries. The determination to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase, or not to purchase reinsurance for a particular risk, customer segment or niche is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions, pricing, availability of reinsurance, our capital levels and our loss history. Such determinations increase our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks, customer segments or niches and, in the event of significant losses associated with such risks, customer segments or niches, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur reinsurers may not pay on losses in a timely fashion, or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe purchase reinsurance to transfer part of the risk we have assumed (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the reinsured) of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable for any reason, including that: (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties of the contract or there is a disagreement between the parties as to their intent; (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced; (iii) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than intended; (iv) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to a flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions; or (v) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially affects a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts, could have a potentially material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur investment results and, therefore, our financial condition may be affected by changes in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest, as well as changes in interest rates, government monetary policies, general economic conditions, liquidity and overall market conditions.\nWe invest the premiums we receive from customers until they are needed to pay expenses or policyholder claims. Income from these investments remaining after paying expenses and claims, remain invested and are included in retained earnings. A substantial portion of our investment portfolio is managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (\u201cGSAM\u201d), and we have engaged New England Asset Management (\u201cNEAM\u201d) to additionally manage a portion of our investment portfolio. Both GSAM and NEAM manage their respective portions of our portfolio pursuant to our investment guidelines. Although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation, our investments are subject to a variety of risks and the value of our investment portfolio can fluctuate as a result of changes in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest. In addition, fluctuations can result from changes in interest rates, credit risk, government monetary policies, liquidity of holdings and general economic conditions. We attempt to mitigate our interest rate and credit risks by having investment guidelines that are designed to result in a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality securities with varied maturities. These fluctuations may negatively impact our financial condition. However, we attempt to manage this risk through our investment guidelines, which provide specific requirements related to asset allocation, duration and security selection.\nThe historical performance of our investment portfolio should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on our common stock.\nOur investment portfolio\u2019s returns have benefitted historically from investment opportunities and general market conditions that currently may not exist and may not repeat themselves, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to avail ourselves of profitable investment opportunities in the future. Furthermore, the historical returns of our investments\nare not directly linked to our future results or returns on our common stock, which are affected by various factors, one of which is the value of our investment portfolio.\nA significant amount of our assets is invested in marketable securities and subject to market fluctuations.\nOur investment portfolio consists almost entirely of debt securities and credit-focused alternative investments. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in marketable securities was approximately $2.4 billion, including cash and cash equivalents. As of that date, our portfolio of securities consisted of the following types of securities: corporate securities (57.2%); mortgage-backed securities (15.8%); collateralized loan obligations (5.7%); U.S. government securities (2.1%); asset-backed securities (2.3%); limited partnerships and limited liability companies (3.7%); short-term investments (0.0%); cash and cash equivalents (0.8%); commercial levered loans (0.5%); state and municipal securities (8.5%); government agency securities (1.3%): non-redeemable preferred stock securities (0.3%); bond exchange-traded funds (1.8%). As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included investments in funds managed by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Barings LLC, Guggenheim Partners, MetLife, Voya Financial and New England Asset Management.\nThe fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of securities generally decreases as interest rates rise. If significant inflation or an increase in interest rates were to occur, the fair value of our securities would be negatively affected. Conversely, if interest rates decline, investment income earned from future investments in securities will be lower. Some securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, given the current extended period of low interest rates, we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals.\nThe value of investments in securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer, default by the issuer in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities and/or increases in market interest rates. To a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession. During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, particularly if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment.\nAlthough the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low, our state and municipal securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. Many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits, the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal securities and the issuer\u2019s ability to perform its obligations thereunder. Additionally, our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest, as well as risks inherent in particular securities.\nAlthough we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal, our efforts may not be successful. Impairments, defaults and/or rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses. Investment returns are currently, and will likely continue to remain, under pressure due to the continued low inflation, actions by the Federal Reserve, economic uncertainty, more generally, and the shape of the yield curve. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges in the method for determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nAs a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, a number of British Bankers\u2019 Association (the \u201cBBA\u201d) member banks entered into settlements with certain regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the BBA, regulators or law enforcement agencies as a result of these or future events may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined or its discontinuation.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021.\nPotential changes or uncertainty related to such potential changes or discontinuation may adversely affect the market for securities that reference LIBOR. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for securities that reference LIBOR or the value of our investment portfolio.\nOur business is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers.\nOur success is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets and relationships with our distributors. Should any of these executive officers cease working for us, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the specialty insurance industry and customer segments that we target, and our business may be adversely affected. We do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees.\nEffective as of May 1, 2019, Lawrence Hannon succeeded Joseph J. Beneducci as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Beneducci, who was a founding member of the Company, took over the role of Executive Chairman of the Company until his resignation, effective February 1, 2020. In connection with this transition, on May 3, 2019, the Company and Mr. Beneducci entered into a Transition and Separation Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Beneducci agreed to provide transition services to us as an employee, including preparing for our IPO and facilitating an orderly transition of the Chief Executive Officer role. On January 23, 2020 we entered into an amendment to Mr. Beneducci\u2019s Transition and Separation Agreement pursuant to which Mr. Beneducci is entitled to certain severance payments and benefits.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified key employees.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. Providing suitable succession planning for such positions is also important. If we cannot attract or retain top-performing executive officers, underwriters and other employees, if the quality of their performance decreases or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the niches in which we operate or to expand our operations into new customer segments and niches.\nThird-party vendors we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have taken action to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economies of scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number of third-party providers. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition to a third-party provider, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations\n(including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), a loss of business and increased costs, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nEmployee and third-party error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses.\nThere have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee or agent misconduct could occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage. In the past, our audits and procedures have led us to identify an incident of fraud by one of our agents, which resulted in enhancements to our monitoring and audit procedures and no other employee or agent fraud has been identified to date. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to deter or prevent misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on multiple computer systems to interact with customers, issue policies, pay claims, run modeling functions, assess insurance risks and complete various important internal processes including accounting and bookkeeping. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions. Additionally, some of these systems may include or rely upon third-party systems not located on our premises. Any of these systems may be exposed to unplanned interruption, unreliability or intrusion from a variety of causes, including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, security breaches or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.\nAny such issues could materially impact our company including the impairment of information availability, compromise of system integrity or accuracy, misappropriation of confidential information, reduction of our volume of transactions and interruption of our general business. Although we believe our computer systems are securely protected and continue to take steps to ensure they are protected against such risks, we cannot guarantee that such problems will never occur. If they do, interruption to our business and damage to our reputation, and related costs, could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cause losses.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could affect our business model and expose us to increased liability.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers or employees. On March 1, 2017, new cybersecurity rules took effect for financial institutions, insurers and certain other companies, like us, supervised by the NY DFS (the \u201cNY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation\u201d). The NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation imposes significant new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation \u2009- Cybersecurity Regulation\u201d.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and operating as a public company will place additional demands on our management.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and rules subsequently implemented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements will place significant additional demands on our management\nand will require us to enhance certain internal functions, such as investor relations, legal, financial reporting and corporate communications. Accordingly, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404(b) (\u201cSection 404\u201d) of Sarbanes-Oxley, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which was both costly and time-consuming. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our intellectual property, proprietary technology platform and brand. In addition, we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our intellectual property, which includes our rights in our proprietary technology platform and our brand. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, service providers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Additionally, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability and scope of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends also in part on our not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. In the future, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products and services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nChanges in accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially affect our reported financial results.\nDevelopments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, stockholders\u2019 equity and other relevant financial statement line items.\nWe are required to comply with statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d). SAP and various components of SAP are subject to constant review by the NAIC and its task forces and committees, as well as state insurance departments, in an effort to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial reporting. Various proposals are pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC, some of which, if enacted, could have negative effects on insurance industry\nparticipants. The NAIC continuously examines existing laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether or in what form such reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect us.\nOur failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the training and experience of our claims staff, our claims department\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could lead to regulatory and administrative actions or material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, if we do not train new claims staff effectively or if we lose a significant number of experienced claims staff, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which, in turn, could adversely affect our operating margins.\nIf actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations, our written premiums in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts are written for a one-year term. In our financial forecasting process, we make assumptions about the rates of renewal of our prior year\u2019s contracts. The insurance and reinsurance industries have historically been cyclical businesses with intense competition, often based on price. If actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write a renewal because of pricing conditions, our written premiums in future years and our future operations would be materially adversely affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nMost insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. These regulations, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and territory in which we do business, relate to, among other things:\n\u25cf approval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\u25cf standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u25cf licensing of insurers;\n\u25cf restrictions on agreements with our large revenue-producing agents;\n\u25cf cancellation and non-renewal of policies;\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u25cf restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u25cf restrictions on transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n\u25cf restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\n\u25cf requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u25cf requiring certain methods of accounting;\n\u25cf periodic examinations of our operations and finances;\n\u25cf prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and\n\u25cf requiring reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes.\nState insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the conduct and affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues, ERM and ORSA and other matters. These regulatory requirements could adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives, including profitable operations in our various customer segments.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could fine us, preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities in certain jurisdictions or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the laws and regulations applicable to the insurance industry or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business as currently conducted and in accordance with our business objectives.\nIn addition to regulations specific to the insurance industry, including the insurance laws of our principal state regulators (the NY DFS and AZ DOI), as a public company we will also be subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE, each of which regulate many areas such as financial and business disclosures, corporate governance and stockholder matters. Among other laws, we are subject to laws relating to federal trade restrictions, privacy/data security and terrorism risk insurance laws.\nIn mid-2019, we were provided with copies of three anonymous letters addressing essentially the same subject matter and strongly indicative of a single source. These letters contained allegations relating to our underwriting, pricing and reserving practices generally in connection with a single segment of our business. At this time, we cannot predict whether the SEC, state insurance regulators or other regulators will take any actions or what the impact of such actions could be. The audit committee of the Company, with the assistance of our internal audit and internal legal personnel and outside counsel, has reviewed these matters carefully. Based on that review process, we have concluded that the allegations are not credible and accordingly do not present any issue material to our business practices, financial statements or disclosures.\nWe monitor these laws, regulations and rules on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance and make appropriate changes as necessary. Implementing such changes may require adjustments to our business methods, increases to our costs and other changes that could cause us to be less competitive in our industry. For further information on the regulation of our business, see \u201cRegulation\u201d.\nNew regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete effectively.\nLegislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may affect our business practices and product designs, how we sell or service certain products we offer or the profitability of our business. We continually\nmonitor such proposals and assess how they might apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to compete effectively.\nWe are an insurance holding company and our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries is subject to regulatory constraints.\nWe are a holding company and, as such, we have no direct operations of our own. We do not expect to have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of our operating subsidiaries. Unrestricted dividends payable from our insurance subsidiaries without the prior approval of applicable regulators are limited to the lesser of 10% of each of New York Marine\u2019s or Gotham\u2019s surplus as shown on the last statutory financial statement on file with the NY DFS or 100% of adjusted net investment income during the applicable twelve month period (where adjusted net investment income equals the net investment income for the twelve month period prior to the declaration or payment of the dividend plus the excess of net investment income over dividends paid in the two years prior thereto); and in Arizona, the greater of 10% of Southwest Marine\u2019s surplus as of the immediately preceding December 31 or Southwest Marine\u2019s net investment income for the period ending the immediately prior December 31. Dividends and other permitted payments from our operating subsidiaries are expected to be a source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including debt service payments and other expenses. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of unrestricted dividends that our insurance subsidiaries could pay to us without approval was $66.8 million. There can be no assurances that our insurance subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future, and the limitations of such dividends could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity or financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by recent and future changes in U.S. federal income tax laws.\nRecent tax legislation (Public Law 115-97), commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, fundamentally overhauls the U.S. tax system by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax, limiting the deductibility of business interest expense, introducing a base erosion and anti-avoidance tax aimed at cross-border deductible payments to related foreign persons, moving closer to a territorial system of taxing earnings generated through foreign subsidiaries and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain post-1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In the context of the taxation of U.S. property and casualty insurance companies such as us, the TCJA modifies the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate. In addition, it is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current Congress or future Congresses that could have an adverse impact on us. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the TCJA may be forthcoming. We cannot predict if, when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided or finalized, whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us.\nWe may suffer losses from litigation, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs is typical in our industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types, including general commercial and corporate litigation, and disputes relating to bad faith allegations which could result in us incurring losses in excess of policy limits. We are party to a variety of litigation matters throughout the year, mostly with respect to claims. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and if there were an outcome unfavorable to us, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in the period in which the outcome occurs. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, we still may face substantial expense and disruption associated with the litigation.\nWe are subject to banking regulations that may limit our business activities.\nGoldman Sachs, affiliates of which own approximately 39.0% of the voting and economic interest in our business as of December 31, 2020, is regulated as a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d). The BHC Act imposes regulations\nand requirements on Goldman Sachs and on any company that is deemed to be \u201ccontrolled\u201d by Goldman Sachs for purposes of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) promulgated thereunder. Due to the size of its voting and economic interest in us, we are deemed to be controlled by Goldman Sachs for purposes of the BHC Act and, therefore, are considered to be a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of Goldman Sachs under the BHC Act. We will remain subject to this regulatory regime until Goldman Sachs is no longer deemed to control us for purposes of the BHC Act, which we do not have the ability to control and which will not occur until Goldman Sachs has significantly reduced its voting and economic interest in us. Restrictions placed on Goldman Sachs as a result of supervisory or enforcement actions under the BHC Act or otherwise may restrict us or our activities in certain circumstances, even if these actions are unrelated to our conduct or business. The Federal Reserve could exercise its power to restrict us from engaging in any activity that, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s opinion, is unauthorized for us or constitutes an unsafe or unsound business practice. Although to date none of these restrictions or limitations have adversely affected our business, to the extent that the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations impose limitations on our business, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are not subject to such regulations.\nAs a subsidiary of a bank holding company, we are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve and could be required to provide information and reports for use by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. In addition, as a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, we are considered a \u201cbanking entity\u201d and subject to the restrictions of Section 13 of the BHC Act, otherwise known as the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, or sponsoring, a covered fund (which includes most private equity funds and hedge funds), subject to satisfying certain conditions, and, in certain circumstances, from engaging in credit related and other transactions with such funds. However, the Volcker Rule exempts from this prohibition regulated insurance companies directly engaged in the business of insurance where such investments are made for the general account of the company or by affiliates, subject to certain conditions. As we are a regulated insurance company whose investments are made for our general account, this exemption has not affected our investment approach. Changes in the provisions of the BHC Act that are made while we still qualify as a banking entity could alter our ability to invest, potentially impacting our profitability.\nWe have agreed to certain covenants in the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement (as later defined) for the benefit of Goldman Sachs that are intended to facilitate its compliance with the BHC Act, but that may impose certain obligations on us. In particular, Goldman Sachs has rights to conduct audits on, and access certain of, our information, and we are obligated to establish (and have established) policies and procedures for compliance with law that are acceptable in form and substance to Goldman Sachs. These covenants will remain in effect as long as the Federal Reserve deems us to be a \u201csubsidiary\u201d of Goldman Sachs under the BHC Act.\nRisks Related to Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and because we have decided to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, we will have the option to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 being permitted to have an extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\u2009(i) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of\u2009 $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; (iii) the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d, which requires that: (A) the market value of our equity securities that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that year; (B) we have been a public reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) for at least twelve calendar months; and (C) we have filed at least one annual report on Annual Report on Form 10-K; and (iv) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering.\nWe expect to continue to avail ourselves of the emerging growth company exemptions described above. In addition, we may but do not expect to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, the information that we provide to stockholders will be less comprehensive than what you might receive from other public companies.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates. Consequently, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we plan to rely on this exemption. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or our industry or if they issue unfavorable commentary or issue negative recommendations with respect to our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that equity research and other securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. We do not have control over these analysts and we may be unable or slow to attract research coverage. One or more analysts could issue negative recommendations with respect to our common stock or publish other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us, our business or our industry. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the market price of our common stock price could decline rapidly and our common stock trading volume could be adversely affected.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nSome factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section of the Annual Report, are:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who cover our common stock;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or earnings guidance or the quarterly financial results or earnings guidance of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders, including our principal stockholders, or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf reputational issues;\n\u25cf changes in general economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf changes in industry conditions or perceptions or changes in the market outlook for the insurance industry; and\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations, regulatory actions affecting us and other dynamics.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. The market prices of securities of insurance companies have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of shares of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of your investment. You should also be aware that price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of shares of our common stock is low.\nOur principal stockholders have significant influence over us, and their interests could conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nOur principal stockholders hold approximately 76.4% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. As a result, our principal stockholders are able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. Our principal stockholders may also have interests that differ from our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our IPO we entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement with the principal stockholders (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d) that governs the relationship between us and the principal stockholders. The Stockholders\u2019 Agreement provides, among other things, that two directors shall be designated for election to the Board of Directors by ProSight Parallel Investment LLC and ProSight Investment LLC (\u201cPI\u201d) ( collectively the \u201cGS Investors\u201d) and two directors shall be designated for election to the Board of Directors by ProSight TPG, L.P., TPG PS 1, L.P., TPG PS 2, L.P., TPG PS 3, L.P. and TPG PS 4, L.P. (collectively, the \u201cTPG Investors\u201d). These designation rights will diminish if either principal stockholder transfers more than a specified percentage of its ownership interest in the Company. Our Board of Directors currently consists of ten directors. See Item 13 \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transaction -\u2009Relationship with the Principal Stockholders - Stockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d on this Annual Report.\u2009\nAs long as our principal stockholders own a majority of our common stock, we may rely on certain exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE available for \u201ccontrolled companies\u201d.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance listing requirements of the NYSE because our principal stockholders own more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. A controlled company\nmay elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Accordingly, our Board of Directors will not be required to have a majority of independent directors and our Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee will not be required to meet the director independence requirements to which we would otherwise be subject until such time as we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Notwithstanding this exemption, our Board of Directors, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee currently meet the director independence requirements under the NYSE rules. If we elect to rely on \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions, you will not have certain of the protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nOur principal stockholders could sell their interests in us to a third party in a private transaction, which may not lead to your realization of any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock and would subject us to the influence of a presently unknown third party.\nOur principal stockholders beneficially own a large percentage of our common stock. Our principal stockholders will have the ability, should they choose to do so, to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction, which, if sufficient in size, could result in another party gaining significant influence over our Company.\nThe ability of our principal stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock privately, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our outstanding common stock that will be publicly traded hereafter, could prevent you from realizing any change-of-control premium on your shares of our common stock that may accrue to our principal stockholders upon their private sales of our common stock.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our shares.\nIf our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions, financings, or other circumstances, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of our common stock could depress the market price of those shares. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our principal stockholders could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 43,657,099 outstanding shares of common stock (including restricted share awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d) and performance-vesting share awards (\u201cPSAs\u201d)). Of these outstanding shares, 9,413,616 shares are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act except for any shares held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including our principal stockholders.\nIn July 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon conversion of equity awards granted under our plans are also freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, 1,407,803 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuances under the 2019 equity incentive plan adopted in connection with the IPO and 987,047 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuances under the 2019 ESPP.\nWe do not anticipate declaring or paying regular dividends on our common stock in the near term, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near term. We currently intend to use our future earnings, if any, to pay debt obligations, to fund our growth and develop our business and for general corporate purposes (which may include capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries in conjunction with future growth of premiums written). Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock in the near term, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price\nat which they are initially offered. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions of capital will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the payment of any future dividends or other distributions of capital will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries) and any other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing the debt we incurred, or debt that we may incur, may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends. For more information, see \u201cDividends.\u201d There can be no assurance that we will establish a dividend policy or pay dividends in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends pursuant to a dividend policy or otherwise.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the exclusive forum for any action under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall be either the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims which are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction or, in the case of an action under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, for which neither the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware nor the federal district court for the District of Delaware has subject matter jurisdiction. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. This decision may be reviewed and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, of Delaware corporate and of state insurance laws, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and of state law may delay, deter, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example, such provisions or laws may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. The provisions provide for, among others:\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u25cf the filling of any vacancies on our Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director or by the stockholders; provided,\nhowever, that after the first time when the principal stockholders cease to beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of our outstanding common stock, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by the stockholders);\n\u25cf certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; and stockholder action by written consent only until the first time when the principal stockholders cease to beneficially own, in the aggregate, 50% or greater of our outstanding common stock.\nSection 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.\nThe insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving the Company. State insurance laws generally prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states\u2019 statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. These regulatory restrictions may delay, deter or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if our Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay sales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our insurance subsidiaries.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 18810, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PROS"}
