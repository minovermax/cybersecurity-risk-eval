{"cik": "93556", "company": "STANLEY BLACK & DECKER, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled \"Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\" in Item 7, and in other documents that the Company files with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to its securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company\u2019s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company\u2019s securities.\nChanges in customer preferences, the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers, inventory reductions by customers, and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has certain significant customers, particularly home centers and major retailers. The two largest customers comprised approximately 22% of net sales, with U.S. and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 37% of net sales. The loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives, or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the Company\u2019s products, related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the Company\u2019s major customers are volume purchasers, a few of which are much larger than the Company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on net sales.\nIf customers in the Convergent Security Solutions (\"CSS\") business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services, or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by CSS, the Company's attrition rates may increase. In periods of increasing attrition rates, recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the Company provides.\nIn times of tough economic conditions, the Company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets. Such distributor de-stocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession. The Company\u2019s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments. Further, the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s future results.\nThe Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.\nThe Company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures. The Company\u2019s products compete on the basis of, among other things, its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. These companies are often located in countries such as China, Taiwan and India where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe. Also, certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the Company\u2019s product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure, develop new products and services, lead product innovation, respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.\nCore SFS / Industry 4.0 is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the Company\u2019s business such as procurement, quality in manufacturing, maximizing customer fill rates, integrating acquisitions and other key business processes. In the event the Company is not successful in effectively applying the Core SFS principles to its key business processes, including those of acquired businesses, its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact its business. The Company engages in restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of production to low-cost countries, as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure. If the Company does not execute restructuring actions well, its ability to meet customer demand may decline, or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted. Similarly, if\nsuch efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors, the Company may lose market share and profits.\nCustomer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers in both North America and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business until either such customers were replaced or the Company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.\nLow demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth.\nThe Company\u2019s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as market demand and costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis. Introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the Company than that of the technology replaced. That increase in costs, which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user preferences, evolving industry standards, or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies. Moreover, the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the Company\u2019s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. The Company\u2019s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.\nThe Company\u2019s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators, or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the Company\u2019s product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing standards, and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the Company's success and competitive position. Unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the Company\u2019s products, but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation, interfere with its ability to effectively represent the Company to its customers, contractors, suppliers, and/or licensees, and increase litigation costs. Similarly, failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the Company\u2019s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue, increased litigation, and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and business. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations.\nSuccessful sales and marketing efforts depend on the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, its sales force and other personnel, including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. A shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to implement its growth strategy.\nThe Company has significant operations outside of the United States, which are subject to political, legal, economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the United States.\nThe Company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the United States. Business operations outside of the United States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\nmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements including those related to the U.S.'s relationship with China;\n\u2022\nthe application of certain labor regulations outside of the United States, including data privacy;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the Company operates, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nthe threat of nationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\nincreased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls limiting importation of goods;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods;\n\u2022\nlimitations on, or impacts from, the repatriation of foreign earnings; and\n\u2022\nexposure to wage, price and capital controls.\nChanges in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company\u2019s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas.\nThe Company imports large quantities of finished goods, component parts and raw materials. Substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements, bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. In addition, the countries in which the Company\u2019s products and materials are manufactured or imported from (including importation into the U.S. of the Company's products manufactured overseas) may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on its imports (including restrictions on manufacturing operations) or adversely modify existing restrictions. For example, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s business. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the Company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. Furthermore, imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the U.S. Imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the Company\u2019s cost of goods sold. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the Company\u2019s suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S. or the European Union (\"EU\"), or making it easier for other companies to compete, by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the Company\u2019s competitors source products.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These\nalternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company has a number of key suppliers in South Korea. Escalation of hostilities with North Korea and/or military action in the region could cause disruptions in the Company's supply chain which could, in turn, cause product shortages, delays in delivery and/or increases in the Company's cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.\nThe Company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and eliminate excess capacity. The Company has undertaken restructuring actions, the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors, including economic weakness, competitive pressures, and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed. Failure to achieve, or delays in achieving, projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures, or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated, would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy compliance.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations, as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the Company\u2019s computer systems and networks, certain products and services, and in the computer systems and networks of its third-party vendors. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out large-scale, complex automated attacks. The Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting security breach or data loss. In addition, it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors.\nBreaches of the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s or such vendors\u2019 websites, applications, data processing, and certain products and services, or disruption of other business operations. Furthermore, any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about the Company\u2019s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the Company\u2019s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the Company\u2019s third-party vendors, can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective.\nTo conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to the Company is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the Company and its subsidiaries. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Implementation of the GDPR and data localization laws will continue to require changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, or may result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and may subject the Company to remedies that may harm its business, including fines or demands or orders that the Company modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, organizational investments, incident response plans, table top exercises and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company\u2019s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the\nmeasures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s systems, products and services or those of the Company\u2019s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions or other costs associated with information technology, cyber attacks, system implementations, data privacy, or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure.\nThe Company relies heavily on computer systems, including those of third parties, to manage and operate its businesses, and record and process transactions. Computer systems are important to production planning, customer service and order fulfillment among other business-critical processes. Consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries.\nDespite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the Company\u2019s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures or computer viruses. Computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as e-mail, telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the Company operates. Additionally, the Company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by third-party vendors, and the Company's business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such third-party systems.\nIn addition, the Company is in the process of system conversions to SAP as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses. There can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies. It is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations, and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization. The risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as SAP conversions are undertaken. If systems fail to function effectively, or become damaged, operational delays may ensue and the Company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues. Any significant disruption in the Company\u2019s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure, notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities, which are concentrated in various geographic locations. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond the Company\u2019s control, like weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, supply and commodity shortages, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, cybersecurity breaches, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt the Company\u2019s infrastructure, or that of its suppliers or distributors. If the Company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations, or cannot quickly repair damage to its information, production or supply systems, the Company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers, and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected. If a material or extended disruption occurs, the Company may lose its customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 confidence or suffer damage to its reputation, and long-term consumer demand for its products and services could decline. Although the Company maintains business interruption insurance, it may not fully protect the Company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions. These events could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials, component parts, freight, energy, labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe Company\u2019s products are manufactured using both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum, and nickel. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity-based materials for components and packaging including, but not limited to, plastics, resins, wood and corrugated products. The Company\u2019s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight, energy and labor. The Company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors. If the Company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.\nConversely, in the event there is deflation, the Company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices, and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to reduce its cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions, the Company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the Company in order to fulfill their obligations. In a limited number of circumstances, the magnitude of the Company\u2019s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or an inability to market products. Changes in value-added tax rebates, currently available to the Company or to its suppliers, could also increase the costs of the Company\u2019s manufactured products, as well as purchased products and components, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nIn addition, many of the Company\u2019s products incorporate battery technology. As other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products, the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the Company\u2019s supply chain. In addition, increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the Company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials. If the Company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints or related increased costs, its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nUncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the U.S. could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company generates approximately 45% of its revenues from outside the U.S., including 22% from Europe and 14% from various emerging market countries. Each of the Company\u2019s segments generates sales from these marketplaces. While the Company believes any downturn in the European or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in North America, the Company\u2019s future growth, profitability and financial liquidity could be affected, in several ways, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\ndepressed consumer and business confidence may decrease demand for products and services;\n\u2022\ncustomers may implement cost-reduction initiatives or delay purchases to address inventory levels;\n\u2022\nsignificant declines of foreign currency values in countries where the Company operates could impact both the revenue growth and overall profitability in those geographies;\n\u2022\na slowing or contracting Chinese economy could reduce China\u2019s consumption and negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales in that region, as well as globally;\n\u2022\na devaluation of foreign currencies could have an effect on the credit worthiness (as well as the availability of funds) of customers in those regions impacting the collectability of receivables;\n\u2022\na devaluation of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of financial assets of the Company in the effected countries;\n\u2022\nthe impact of an event (individual country default, Brexit, or break up of the Euro) could have an adverse impact on the global credit markets and global liquidity potentially impacting the Company\u2019s ability to access these credit markets and to raise capital. With respect to Brexit, until the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU in March 2019 are determined, including any transition period, it is difficult to predict its impact. It is possible that the withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments to which the Company\u2019s businesses are subject, impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties and create economic and political uncertainty in the region.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability.\nThe Company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world. As a result, there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the Company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company\u2019s predominant currency exposures are related to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) and the Taiwan Dollar. In preparing its financial statements, for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates. With respect to the effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company\u2019s earnings could be negatively impacted. In 2018, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by approximately $100.0 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.55. The translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future. Although the Company utilizes risk management tools,\nincluding hedging, as it deems appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated. The Company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances.\nThe Company sources many products from China and other low-cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the RMB or other currencies appreciate, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases. The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, significant indebtedness, or issue additional equity securities, in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the Company\u2019s access to external sources of liquidity. The potential issuance of such securities may limit the Company\u2019s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings.\nAs described in Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company has a five-year $2.0 billion committed credit facility and a 364-day $1.0 billion committed credit facility. No amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at December 29, 2018.\nThe instruments and agreements governing certain of the Company\u2019s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include, among other things:\n\u2022\na limitation on creating liens on certain property of the Company and its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\na restriction on entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncustomary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement; and\n\u2022\nmaintenance of a specified financial ratio. The Company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities. The interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization to adjusted Interest Expense (\"adjusted EBITDA\"/\"adjusted Interest Expense\"); such adjustments to interest or EBITDA include, but are not limited to, removal of non-cash interest expense and stock-based compensation expense. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.5 times and is computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve months (last twelve months) basis. Under this covenant definition, the interest coverage ratio was 8.5 times EBITDA or higher in each of the 2018 quarterly measurement periods. Management does not believe it is reasonably likely the Company will breach this covenant. Failure to maintain this ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity.\nFuture instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants. Such covenants could restrict the Company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies.\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates, including forward contracts, options and swap agreements. The failure of one or more counterparties to the Company\u2019s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nTight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the Company by limiting the Company\u2019s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term growth plans are dependent on, among other things, the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines. While the Company has not encountered financing difficulties to date, the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future. Market conditions could make it more difficult for the Company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions. In addition, changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as a benchmark reference for short-term interests, could create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing.\nFurthermore, there could be a number of follow-on effects from a credit crisis on the Company\u2019s businesses, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company\u2019s products and services and/or customer insolvencies.\nIn addition, the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company for purposes of assigning credit ratings. The Company\u2019s ability to access the credit markets, and the cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions. Failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company is able to obtain financing, as well as its access to the capital markets.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisitions, as well as general business reorganizations, may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations.\nIn 2018, the Company completed the Nelson acquisition as well as a number of other smaller acquisitions. In addition, the Company reached an agreement to acquire International Equipment Solutions Attachments Group (\"IES Attachments\"), which is expected to close in the first half of 2019, and may make additional acquisitions in the future.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify and close on appropriate acquisition opportunities within desired time frames at reasonable cost;\n\u2022\nthe anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize, despite extensive due diligence;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the acquired companies will not be successfully integrated or that anticipated cost savings, synergies, or other benefits will not be realized;\n\u2022\nthe acquired businesses will lose market acceptance or profitability;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of Company management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of unexpected costs and liabilities, including those associated with undisclosed pre-closing regulatory violations by the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel, clients or customers of acquired companies.\nIn addition, the success of the Company\u2019s long-term growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to:\n\u2022\ncombine businesses and operations;\n\u2022\nintegrate departments, systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nobtain cost savings and other efficiencies from such reorganizations, including the Company's functional transformation initiative.\nFailure to effectively consummate or manage the pending IES Attachments acquisition and any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations, and mitigate the related risks, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large write-offs, significant restructuring costs, contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation, and/or adverse tax or other consequences. The Company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized.\nExpansion of the Company's activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures.\nThe Company's growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. Local business practices in these regions may not comply with U.S. laws, local laws or other laws applicable to the Company. When investigating potential acquisitions, the Company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the Company were they to continue post-completion or as a successor to the target. Where such practices are discovered, the Company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction. In assessing the risk, the Company looks at, among other factors, the nature of the violation, the potential liability, including any fines or penalties that might be incurred, the ability to avoid, minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks, and the likelihood that the Company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures. Due diligence and risk assessment are, however, imperfect processes, and it is possible that the Company will not discover problematic practices until after completion, or that the Company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities. Should that occur, the Company may incur fees,\nfines, penalties, injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the Company's earnings.\nSignificant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the Company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. Future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the Company\u2019s prospective income tax expense.\nThe Company is subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company\u2019s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. The Company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions. Although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any audit (or related litigation) could differ materially from amounts reflected in the Company\u2019s income tax accruals. Additionally, the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar since a significant amount of the Company\u2019s earnings are generated outside the United States. Lastly, it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, changes to U.S. international taxation, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Following enactment of the Act and the associated one-time transition tax, in general, repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax. However, repatriation of foreign earnings could subject the Company to U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes (including withholding taxes) on distributions. While repatriation of some foreign earnings held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company\u2019s foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 could be repatriated to the United States. Pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) issued by the SEC in December 2017, issuers were permitted up to one year from the enactment of the Act to complete the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act (\u201cthe measurement period\u201d). The Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the Act within the measurement period and has included those effects in Income Taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to successfully avoid, manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business, including, from time to time, actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions, product liability, workers compensation, arrangements between the Company and its distributors, franchisees or vendors, intellectual property claims and regulatory actions.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted. Some of the Company\u2019s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations. The Company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations. In addition, the Company is currently, and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and clean-up costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment, including sites that have never been owned or operated by the Company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. Changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for non-compliance.\nThe Company manufactures products, configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation. If such products, systems and services are not properly manufactured, configured, installed, designed or delivered, personal injuries, property damage or business interruption could result, which could subject the Company to claims for damages. The costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to successfully avoid, manage and defend such matters. In addition, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the Company\u2019s estimates for such contingent liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s products could be recalled.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of the Company\u2019s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. A recall could increase costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIf the Company were required to write-down all or part of its goodwill, indefinite-lived trade names, or other definite-lived intangible assets, its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of the Black and Decker merger and other acquisitions, the Company has approximately $9.0 billion of goodwill, approximately $2.2 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and approximately $1.3 billion of net definite-lived intangible assets at December 29, 2018. The Company is required to periodically, at least annually, determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived trade names have become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset. The definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate. Impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the Company\u2019s control, such as worsening economic conditions, technological change, intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences.\nIf the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected, the Company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes.\nThe Company sponsors pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans. The Company\u2019s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities, government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments and insurance contracts. The Company\u2019s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require, among other things, that the Company make cash contributions to under-funded pension plans. During 2018, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximately $45 million and it expects to contribute $44 million to its defined benefit plans in 2019.\nThere can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient in the future. It is therefore possible that the Company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes, and that the Company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the Company and result in higher expense in future years. The fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at December 29, 2018 was approximately $2.0 billion.", "PERMNO": 43350, "SIC": 3540, "TIC": "SWK"}
