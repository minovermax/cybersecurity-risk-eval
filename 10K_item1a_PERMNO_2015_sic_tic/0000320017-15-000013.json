RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only ones we face, but those we currently consider to be material. There may be other risks which we now consider immaterial, or which are unknown or unpredictable, with respect to our business, our competition, the regulatory environment or otherwise that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past, and expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe have a limited operating history, limited capital, and limited sources of revenue. Since our inception in 1980 through December 31, 2014, we have incurred aggregate net losses of approximately $291.2 million. Our net losses attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were approximately $54.9 million and $39.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $19.2 million. The revenues generated in our cell therapy services business have not been, and are not expected in the foreseeable future to be, sufficient to cover costs attributable to that business or to our operations as a whole, including our development activities associated with our product candidates. Ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenue from our cell therapy services business for us to reach profitability, generate positive cash flow or sustain, on an ongoing basis, our current or projected levels of product development and other operations.\nWe anticipate that we will need substantial additional financing to continue our operations; if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our product development programs, or expansion of our manufacturing operations and our business will be harmed.\nOur current operating plan will require significant levels of additional capital to fund, the continued development of our cell therapy product candidates and the operation, enhancement and expansion of our manufacturing operations and our clinical development activities.\nOur research and development expenses increased significantly over the past three years as a result of conducting the PreSERVE AMI Phase 2 clinical trial of NBS10 for which we reported primary analysis results in November 2014. We plan to meet with the FDA to determine next steps for development. Research and development expenses also have been increasing with our initiation in Q4 2014 of clinical trial sites for our Intus Phase 3 clinical trial for NBS20 for metastatic melanoma, for which we expect to randomize the first patient in Q2 2015. The cost of this trial is expected to be $25 million. We are also preparing for the initiation in late 2015 or 2016, depending on resource availability, of a Phase 2 clinical trial of NBS03D for diabetes and have other costs relating to that program, particularly due to the licensing of patents, data and collaboration with third parties. The Company's clinical activities are expected to continue to grow as these programs are advanced and they will require significant investment over a period of several years before they could be approved by FDA and commercialized by us, if ever. Even with encouraging results from the Phase 2 PreSERVE clinical trial and encouraging results that we could receive from our other earlier stage clinical trials for NBS10 and other products, we are required us to conduct additional clinical studies of the product, including larger and more expensive pivotal Phase 3 studies. To do so, we will need to raise additional money in the capital markets, enter into collaboration agreements with third parties or undertake some combination thereof. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, we will likely need to otherwise delay or abandon the trials.\nThe amount and timing of our future capital requirements also will likely depend on many other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results, costs, timing and outcomes of our cell therapy research and development programs and product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into any collaboration agreements with third parties for our product candidates and the timing and terms of any such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the consummation of one or more strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, a process which could be particularly lengthy or complex given the FDA's limited experience with marketing approval for cell therapy products;\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of expansion of our development and manufacturing operations, including but not limited to the costs of expanded facilities, equipment costs, engineering and innovation initiatives and personnel.\nIndex\nTo both fund our clinical studies and support our future operations, we would likely seek to raise capital through a variety of different public and/or private financings vehicles. This could include, but not be limited to, use of our common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital, as described below, potential warrant exercises, option exercises, issuances of other debt or equity securities in public or private financings, and/or sale of assets. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. Servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities, including our Oxford debt facility, or whether we call it, diverts funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development, clinical or commercialization activities. In addition, debt financing involves covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business. In certain cases, we also may seek funding through collaborative arrangements, that would likely require us to relinquish certain rights to our technology or product candidates and share in the future revenues associated with the partnered product.\nUltimately, we may be unable to raise capital or enter into collaborative relationships on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain necessary capital or financing to fund our future operating needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of factors.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not anticipate generating any revenue from product sales until some time after we have received regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate, which may never occur. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many factors, including:\n\u2022\ncompleting research regarding, and nonclinical and clinical development of, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;\n\u2022\ndeveloping a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for our product candidates, including growing our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022\nobtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nidentifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nmaintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nCompliance with public company obligations, including the securities laws and regulations, is costly and requires significant management resources, and we may fail to comply. We are an \u201caccelerated filer,\u201d and beginning with our Form 10-Q for the\nIndex\nquarter ending March 31, 2014 and no longer qualify to report under smaller reporting company disclosure rules, and as a result are subject to more comprehensive disclosure obligations, with increased compliance costs.\nThe federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. Because the aggregate market value of our public float was in excess of $75 million as of June 30, 2013, we became an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d as of the end of our 2013 fiscal year. As a result, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements is now required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The auditor attestation requirement applied to us for the first time with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2013. In addition, beginning with our Form 10-Q for March 31, 2014, we were required to satisfy all of the larger reporting company disclosure requirements. These requirements will increase our legal compliance obligations and costs, which could harm our results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention from business operations.\nRelatively speaking, we are a small company with limited resources. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the added \u201caccelerated filer\u201d requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in the future. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CELL THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS\nOur future success is significantly dependent on the timely and successful development and commercialization of NBS20, our metastatic melanoma product candidate and if we encounter delays or difficulties in the development of this product candidate, as well as NBS10, our post-AMI product candidate, and NBS03D, our T1DM product candidate, that are at earlier stages of development, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Before we are able to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, we must conduct and complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. All of our product candidates are in early stages of development except for NBS20 which is the subject of a Phase 3 clinical trial for stage IV or recurrent stage III metastatic melanoma for which we began initiating clinical sites in Q42014 and expect to randomize the first patient in 2Q2015. We expect to complete enrollment of our Phase 3 Intus study in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor our Phase 2 PreSERVE study, we reported in November 2014 results from the primary analysis that allowed for important observations of a potential dose-dependent treatment effect that will help guide the next phase of development. However, for our primary efficacy endpoint, our hypothesis that an imaging technique (SPECT) used to measure perfusion could be used as a surrogate marker for the current medically relevant and regulatory endpoints was disproven, though it gave us valuable direction regarding endpoints and analyses for future clinical trials. We expect to complete the PreSERVE AMI study as defined through the final three-year follow-up and, in the meantime, plan to meet with the FDA to discuss our results and our proposal for the next step(s) in development. Finalization of the decision for next steps for NBS10 are expected in the second half of 2015. We also plan to initiate in late 2015 or early 2016 a Phase 2 study of NBS03D, a Treg based therapeutic being developed to treat T1DM. We are also actively exploring means by which we can take advantage of the paradigm of conditional approval for regenerative medicine products established by new regulations in Japan for products that show sufficient safety evidence and some evidence of efficacy with CLI and liver cancer being the indications we are considering. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. Importantly, a failure of one or more of these or any other clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete our clinical studies, receive regulatory approval or commercialize our cell therapy product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuspensions, delays or changes in the design, initiation, enrollment, implementation or completion of required clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in our financial position or significant and unexpected increases in the cost of our clinical development program;\n\u2022\nchanges or uncertainties in, or additions to, the regulatory approval process that require us to alter our current development strategy;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results that are negative, inconclusive or even less than desired as to safety and/or efficacy, which could result in the need for additional clinical studies or the termination of the product's development;\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to manufacture the product in quantities or in a form that is suitable for any required clinical trials;\nIndex\n\u2022\nintellectual property constraints that prevent us from making, using, or commercializing any of our cell therapy product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of these product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate:\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical studies;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical study sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical study site;\n\u2022\nimposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including after review of an IND application or amendment, or equivalent application or amendment; as a result of a new safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical trial participants; a negative finding from an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites; developments on trials conducted by competitors or approved products post-market for related technology that raises FDA concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly; or if FDA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives;\n\u2022\ndifficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\n\u2022\nfailure by our CROs, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical study requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients qualify for or complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\npatients dropping out of a study;\n\u2022\noccurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u2022\ntransfer of manufacturing processes from our academic collaborators to larger-scale facilities operated by either a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, or by us, and delays or failure by our CMOs or us to make any necessary changes to such manufacturing process;\n\u2022\ndelays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing; and\n\u2022\nFDA may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical sites in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nDuring our Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of NBS10 for post AMI patients, serious adverse events occurred in subjects treated with NBS10 as well as in the control group, such as cardiogenic shock that resulted in the death of a patient in the Phase 2 trial; although the investigator deemed the event not related to the study product or procedures, we are not able to rule out a relationship. There can be no assurance that similar or other additional events will not occur as we continue to follow patients in the Phase 2 trial or that additional events will not occur. No concerns have been articulated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (\"DSMB\"), a group charged with looking at unblinded results during the course of the study which recommended continuing our PreServe AMI Phase 2 clinical trial. In the Phase 2 clinical trial of NBS20 in metastatic melanoma serious adverse events included AMI, seizures, and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, the events in the trial were judged as unrelated to study participation by the investigator.\nThe Phase 2 study of NBS20 in metastatic melanoma originally was designed to include 200 patients. However, the study was terminated early due to funding issues faced by the prior owner of NBS20; as a result, a final analysis was conducted of 42 patients who had been randomized and received either TC or DC-TC.\nIndex\nCreation of NBS20, our cancer vaccine for melanoma, is based on a complex process that involves, among other things, the growing out in culture of cancer initiating cells for each patient until a sufficient number of purified cells have been obtained for the treatment, which is the first step to potential randomization into the Intus Phase 3 clinical trial if we experience problems with the manufacture of NBS20, our Phase 3 clinical trial could be delayed.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete our clinical development program for our product candidates, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to market one or more of the products, we may, among other things:\n\u009f\nobtain approval for indications that are not as broad as the indications we sought;\n\u009f\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval;\n\u009f\nencounter issues with respect to the manufacturing of commercial supplies;\n\u009f\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; and/or\n\u009f\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used.\nWe may experience delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe may not be able to initiate or complete as planned any clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. For example, we had originally expected to complete enrollment for the PreSERVE AMI Phase 2 trial of NBS10 earlier than its December 2013 completion. For our Intus Phase 3 trial of NBS20 in metastatic melanoma, we are targeting to complete enrollment by the fourth quarter of 2016 but challenges in enrolling patients could impede our ability to achieve this goal. We also may be unable to engage a sufficient number of clinical trial sites to conduct our trials. The challenge of enrolling patients is increased as we seek patients to participate in our trials from Europe, Australia and New Zealand or other jurisdictions to increase the likelihood of timely completing enrollment of our trial, which could raise clinical trial costs and could raise regulatory uncertainties, such as the willingness of the FDA to accept clinical data from certain foreign countries. Moreover, because PCT does not currently have manufacturing facilities operating outside of the United States, our ability to conduct trials outside of the U.S. may be constrained by our ability to transport trial materials to foreign destinations within the expiry period of such materials unless and until we commence operation outside of the United States or find another source of supply.\nWe may face challenges in enrolling patients to participate in our clinical trials due to the novelty of our cell-based therapies, the size of the patient populations and the eligibility criteria for enrollment in the trial. In addition, some patients may have concerns regarding cell therapy that may negatively affect their perception of therapies under development and their decision to enroll in the trials. Furthermore, patients suffering from diseases within target indications may enroll in competing clinical trials, which could negatively affect our ability to complete enrollment of our trials. Enrollment challenges in clinical trials often result in increased development costs for a product candidate, significant delays and potentially the abandonment of the clinical trial.\nWe may have other delays in completing our clinical trials and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not completed the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market NBS20, NBS10, NBS03D or any of our other products in development. Other than INTUS, we have not initiated Phase 3 studies for any of our other products in development. Our management lacks significant experience in completing Phase 3 trials and bringing a drug through commercialization. INTUS and clinical trials for other products in development may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\npatients failing to complete clinical trials due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects or other reasons;\n\u2022\nfailure by regulators to authorize us to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination by regulators of clinical research for many reasons, including concerns about patient safety or failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with cGMP requirements;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure to obtain clinical supply for our products necessary to conduct clinical trials from contract manufacturers, including commercial grade clinical supply for our Phase 3 clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntreatment candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to continue to fund clinical trials or to find a partner to fund the clinical trials;\nIndex\n\u2022\ncompetition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians; and\n\u2022\ndelays in completing data collection and analysis for clinical trials.\nAny delay or failure to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our cost to develop and commercialize, and our ability to generate revenue from, a particular product candidate.\nWe may be unable to manage multiple late stage clinical trials for a variety of product candidates simultaneously.\nAs our current clinical trials progress, we may need to manage multiple late stage clinical trials simultaneously in order to continue developing all of our current products. Our management team does not have significant experience in completing late stage clinical trials and the management of late stage clinical trials is more complex and time consuming than early stage trials. Typically, early stage trials involve several hundred patients in no more than 10-30 clinical sites. Late stage (Phase 3) trials may involve up to several thousand patients in up to several hundred clinical sites and may require facilities in several countries. Therefore, the project management required to supervise and control such an extensive program is substantially larger than early stage programs. As the need for these resources is not known until some months before the trials begin, it is necessary to recruit large numbers of experienced and talented individuals very quickly. If the labor market does not allow this team to be recruited quickly, the sponsor is faced with a decision to delay the program or to initiate it with inadequate management resources. This may result in recruitment of inappropriate patients, inadequate monitoring of clinical investigators and inappropriate handling of data or data analysis. Consequently it is possible that conclusions of efficacy or safety may not be acceptable to permit filing of a BLA for any one of the above reasons or a combination of several.\nThe development of our cell therapy product candidates are subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.\nWhen manufacturing an autologous cell therapy, the number and the composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective or profitable manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nAny disruption to our access to the reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.\nReagents, including CD3 and CD28 antibody conjugated magnetic beads manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation, as well as, devices, materials and systems that we are using in our clinical trials, that we intend to use in our planned clinical trials and that we may need or use in commercial production, are provided by unaffiliated third parties. Any lack of continued availability of these reagents, devices, materials and systems for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete these studies and could adversely impact our ability to achieve commercial manufacture of our planned therapeutic products. Although other available sources for these reagents, devices, materials and systems may exist in the marketplace, we have not evaluated their cost, effectiveness, or intellectual property foundation and therefore cannot guarantee the suitability or availability of such other potential sources.\nThe initiation of pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for cell therapy product candidates, including NBS20, require the validation and establishment of manufacturing controls that may delay the products' development timeline.\nTo conduct pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, we are required to have certain validated and established manufacturing controls with respect to the safety, purity and potency of our product when administered to patients. For example, in 2014, we began initiating clinical sites for our Intus Phase 3 clinical trial for stage IV or recurrent stage III metastatic melanoma. Although the FDA had questions about our potency the results of assay and placed the trial on clinical hold, we have since addressed those concerns, and the clinical hold was lifted. We believe our Phase 2 PreSERVE clinical trial of NBS10 in post-AMI patients were compelling and warrants further development although we expect to meet with the FDA to discuss our results and our proposal for the next step(s) in development. If we determine that the results of our planned Phase 2 clinical trial in T1DM or the results of any other Phase 2 clinical trial we may conduct support Phase 3 development, we expect to initiate and complete one or more pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for that program and would need to address any outstanding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, issues raised by the FDA prior to initiating such trials. We may not be successful in our efforts to address any CMC issues raised by the FDA. If we cannot initiate, or if we are delayed in initiating, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical program as a result of our failure to satisfy the FDA's CMC concerns or otherwise, the timing of our planned regulatory submission for commercialization\nIndex\nof our product candidates would be delayed, or we may be unable to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our products at all.\nWe may not obtain, or may be unable to maintain, approval for our pivotal Intus Phase 3 clinical trial in countries outside the US.\nWe intend to expand our Intus Phase 3 clinical trial of NBS20 to include sites in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and possibly elsewhere. In each country in which we intend to have a study site, we will need to obtain a clinical trial authorization from the local regulatory authority and an approval from the appropriate ethics committee. Such local regulatory authorities and ethics committees may refuse to approve our clinical trial, or may significantly delay approval if they raise issues with our application. We may not be successful in addressing any issues raised by the authorities and ethics committees. The authorities and ethics committees may also require amendments to the study protocol or other study documentation as a condition of approval and such changes may make it impractical for us to proceed with the study in that country. Following any approval, the authorities and ethics committees could suspend or terminate the trial if we are unable to comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements or if safety concerns arise during the conduct of the trial. Failure to obtain or maintain approval of our Intus Phase 3 clinical trial in one or more countries could delay the timing of our planned regulatory submission for commercialization of NBS20 or could negatively impact the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize NBS20.\nThe FDA has reviewed the protocol for the Phase 3 Intus clinical trial of NBS20; however, agreement by the FDA with the protocol under the SPA process does not guarantee that the trial will be successful or that, if successful, NBS20 will receive marketing approval on the basis of a single Phase 3 trial.\nThe FDA has reviewed, under the SPA process, the protocol for the Phase 3 Intus clinical trial of NBS20. An SPA is an agreement from the FDA that the design of a particular Phase 3 trial, including clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to serve as the primary basis for submission of a BLA. An SPA does not guarantee that NBS20 will receive marketing approval. Although an SPA is generally binding on the FDA, the FDA can choose not to honor an SPA for a number of reasons, including if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. While FDA generally follows this practice, the agency has on occasion refused to honor an SPA because it no longer agrees with the study design at the time of the review of the application. Issues related to safety, study conduct, bias, deviation from the protocol, statistical power, patient completion rates, changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data may also affect approvability. In addition, NBS20 may not achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. Even with the SPA agreement, the FDA may still require additional pivotal clinical trials as a condition for approving NBS20. Many companies that have been granted SPAs have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their products.\nWhile the FDA requires in most cases two adequate and well-controlled pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of a product candidate, a single pivotal trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Even if the primary endpoint in our single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial is achieved, NBS20 may not be approved.\nIf the results for the primary endpoint are not robust, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other study endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our BLA based upon a single clinical trial. The FDA may also seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision.\nProducts that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or may fail to reach later stages of clinical development.\nThe successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain. Product candidates that appear promising in research and development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development. Decisions regarding the further development of product candidates must be made with limited and incomplete data, which makes it difficult to ensure or even accurately predict whether the allocation of limited resources and the expenditure of additional capital on specific product candidates will result in desired outcomes. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, and negative or inconclusive results or adverse events during a clinical trial could delay, limit or prevent the development of a product candidate.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIndex\nIf a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet needs for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. NBS20 has received Fast Track designation. Fast track designation does not ensure that we will experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from the clinical development program.\nThere can be no assurances that we will realize the desired benefits of the Orphan Drug designation granted to NBS20.\nThe FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for NBS20 for the treatment of stage IIIb through stage IV metastatic melanoma because it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug\u2019s Orphan Designation in the US is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the Orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant\u2019s product; (iv) the Orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.\nOrphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential for a period of market exclusivity, we may be eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption form the FDA application user fee. There can be no assurances that we will realize the desired benefits of the orphan drug designation granted to NBS20. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThe clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. In particular, because our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological drug products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure, and potent for use in their target indications. Each product candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product licensure will vary depending on these factors and may include not only the ability to show tumor shrinkage (in the case of NBS20), but also adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease, and/or an improvement in survival. For example, response rates from the use of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval unless we can also show an adequate duration of response. In addition, our Intus trial for NBS20 in metastatic melanoma contains a single endpoint - overall survival. While we believe unequivocal robust positive findings on overall survival would support approval, the lack of additional endpoints may make a finding of internally consistent results difficult and could present a risk should there be unexpected safety or efficacy results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Exploratory trends and results observed in earlier stage clinical trials, particularly trends and results observed for small subsets that were not prespecified, may not be replicated in later stage clinical trials. As is common with Phase 2 trials, we explored a number of endpoints and analyzed the data from our PreSERVE clinical trial of NBS10 in a number of ways, some of which were not prespecified. For example, the potential dose-dependent treatment effects we observed were seen in post hoc analyses of subsets based on the number of CD34 cells received, with our most encouraging results in a small subset of 15 patients. Product candidates such as NBS10 in Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical trials, even if certain exploratory subset analyses of primary or secondary endpoints in those early trials showed trends toward efficacy or, in some analyses, nominal statistical significance. The results of studies in one set of patients or line of treatment may not be predictive of those obtained in another.\nIndex\nWe expect there may be greater variability in results for products processed and administered on a patient-by-patient basis, as anticipated for our product candidates, than for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products, like many other drugs. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization.\nData from earlier studies conducted by the third-party research institutions such as Hoag Hospital for NBS20 and UCSF/Yale for NBS03D, should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger-scale clinical trials will succeed. Some future trials may have different patient populations than current studies and will test our product candidates in different indications, among other differences. In addition, our proposed manufacturing processes for our product candidates include what we believe will be process improvements that are not part of the production processes that were previously used in the earlier conducted clinical trials being conducted by the research institutions. Accordingly, our results with our product candidates may not be consistent with the results of the clinical trials.\nIn addition, even if such trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nWe presently lack sufficient manufacturing capabilities to produce our product candidates at commercial scale quantities and do not have an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.\nCurrently, PCT exclusively provides the cell processing services necessary for clinical production of NBS20 for our Phase 3 melanoma trial and will provide the cell processing services for our planned NBS03D Phase 2 diabetes trial as well as anticipated future trials of NBS10 for STEMI. PCT also provides services and produces materials for clinical trials on behalf of unaffiliated third parties. To date, PCT has not produced any products at commercial scale quantities. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential commercial demand for NBS20, NBS10, NBS03D and any other of our product candidates, if approved, as well as any of our other product candidates that might attain regulatory approval. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. Even if we increase our manufacturing capabilities, it is possible that we may still lack sufficient capacity to meet demand. Ultimately, if we are unable to supply our products to meet commercial demand, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, sales of the products and their long term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nWe do not presently have a third-party supply for NBS20, NBS10, NBS03D or any of our other product candidates. If our facilities where these product candidates are being manufactured or equipment were significantly damaged or destroyed, or if there were other disruptions, delays or difficulties affecting manufacturing capacity, our planned and future clinical studies and commercial production for these product candidates would likely be significantly disrupted and delayed. It would be both time consuming and expensive to replace this capacity with third parties, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the regulatory requirements.\nUltimately, if we are unable to supply our cell therapy product candidates to meet commercial demand, were commercial approval obtained, whether because of processing constraints or other disruptions, delays or difficulties that we experience, our production costs could dramatically increase and sales of the product and its long-term commercial prospects could be significantly damaged.\nThe commercial potential and profitability of our products are unknown and subject to significant risk and uncertainty.\nEven if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates, the market may not understand or accept the products, which could adversely affect both the timing and level of future sales. Ultimately, the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates (or any of our future product candidates) will depend on a number of factors, including:\nIndex\n\u009f\nthe clinical effectiveness, safety and convenience of the product particularly in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u009f\nour ability to distinguish our products (which involve adult cells) from any ethical and political controversies associated with stem cell products derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue; and\n\u009f\nthe cost of the product, the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nEven if we are successful in achieving sales of our product candidates, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable. The costs of goods associated with production of cell therapy products are significant. While we are working to improve the speed and efficiency and lower the cost of our manufacturing processes, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. In addition, some changes in manufacturing processes or procedures generally require FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation. We may need to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates.\nWe may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute the shares of our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nFurther, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\nIndex\n\u2022\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in the development and marketing of cell therapies and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to establish a profitable business.\nOver the past four years, we shifted our business plan entirely to focus on capturing a piece of the burgeoning field of cell therapy. Despite being in business for over eight years, we have limited experience in the areas of cell therapy product development and marketing, and in the related regulatory issues and processes. Although we have recruited a team that has experience with designing and conducting clinical trials, as a company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and no experience in conducting clinical trials through to regulatory approval of any product candidate. In part because of this lack of experience, we cannot be certain that ongoing or planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time, if at all. While PCT historically has provided services in connection with our development activities, we cannot assure you that our management will successfully oversee our clinical development efforts and our plans to capture a piece of the cell therapy market.\nOur cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.\nThe clinical development, commercialization and marketing of cell and tissue-based therapies are at an early-stage, substantially research-oriented, and financially speculative. To date, very few companies have been successful in their efforts to develop and commercialize a cell therapy product. In general, cell-based or tissue-based products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. In addition, NBS20 is an immunotherapy candidate that is produced by using a patient\u2019s own dendritic cells loaded with antigens from irradiated tumor stem cells from the patient which are then suspended in an immune stimulant. Regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as NBS20, which is manufactured using novel manufacturing processes, can be more complex and expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to the FDA\u2019s lack of experience with them. To our knowledge, the FDA has only approved one personalized immunotherapy product to date. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, which would increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Furthermore, the number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies is difficult to forecast with accuracy. Our future success is dependent on the establishment of a large global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and our ability to capture a share of this market with our product candidates.\nIf competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer, or less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages, our commercial prospects will be limited.\nOur cell therapy development programs now face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of drugs and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting with our product candidates.\nBecause NBS10 generally targets patients without other revascularization options, we do not believe it will compete directly with pharmaceutical therapies being developed to treat less severe stages of our target indications. However, to the extent that therapies are developed that reverse the progression of the ischemic damage or improve blood flow to damaged tissue, they could have the effect of reducing demand for our product. In addition, because NBS10 requires the removal of bone marrow from the patient, potential competing products offering efficacious alternatives through a less invasive procedure may have a competitive advantage in terms of patient appeal. New pharmaceutical agents or devices that improve the repair of cardiac injury after a heart attack, with the result that fewer patients develop ischemic heart failure, would also represent a competitive threat for NBS10.\nIndex\nFurthermore, cell-based therapies, such as cardiac derived cells, bone marrow-derived stem cells and adipose cells are being pursued by companies such as Cardio3, Capricor, Mesoblast, Vericel Corporation, Angioblast Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc., ReNeuron Group, Stemedica Cell Technologies Inc. and Bioheart, Inc. Some other companies, such as Cytori and Miltenyi, are developing medical devices to facilitate the production of therapeutic cell populations by clinicians for the treatment of NBS10\u2019s target indications. Such devices may be approved by the FDA under a less rigorous regulatory process, and less extensive clinical testing and manufacturing controls than we are required to pursue for NBS10 and thus could reach the market well before NBS10.\nWith respect to NBS20, the field of melanoma drug development is highly competitive. According to a 2015 Research and Markets report, there are approximately 274 companies plus partners developing 310 drugs targeting melanoma in development. Several recently approved approaches have demonstrated improved clinical benefits in melanoma, including ipilumimab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, respectively). These drugs represent a new class of \u201cimmunotherapeutics\u201d and have novel mechanisms of action targeting immune checkpoints. BRAF enzyme inhibitors include vemurafenib, marketed by Roche and dabrafenib from GlaxoSmithKline. Also recently approved is trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) from GlaxoSmithKline. These target critical intracellular protein pathways. In addition to the immune checkpoint modulators, several companies are developing therapeutic vaccines that act by priming a person\u2019s immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells. Amgen presented promising results with its Phase 3 melanoma vaccine, talimogene laherparepvec, T-VEC, which is an engineered virus injected directly into tumor and demonstrated survival. Northwest Biotherapeutics is developing a dendritic cell therapy which uses antigens derived from the lysate from the patient\u2019s surgically resected tumor tissue. Northwest Biotherapeutics is in Phase 3 clinical studies in glioblastoma. Argos Therapeutics uses dendritic cells loaded with RNA amplified from a patient\u2019s tumor to generate tumor specific antigens. A Phase 3 study in renal cell cancer is currently underway and is expected to complete in 2015. Some of these agents are presently on the market and others could reach the market before NBS20, representing competition that could materially impact the commercial success of NBS 20.\nOur T regulatory cell therapy product candidate for recent onset Type 1 diabetes (NBS03D) faces competition from other immunomodulatory drugs being developed for other autoimmune diseases as well from other cellular therapies that fall outside of the coverage of our intellectual property. Current approaches include immune modulatory agents aiming to improve metabolic function by rescuing insulin producing beta cells, as well as regenerative agents that are hoping to replace beta cells altogether. There are many novel agents in early development, including ultra-low dose of Interleukin-2, which has been advanced to phase 2 by ILTOO Pharma. Also in early development are beta-cell replacement therapies such as that of ViaCYTE, Inc., which employ technologies that protect transplanted beta-cells from immune attack. If these therapies are easier to manufacture and have similar or better safety and efficacy profiles to NBS03D, the commercial prospects of our T regulatory cell therapy may be limited.\nAs a general matter, we also face competition from many other companies that are researching and developing cell therapies. Many of these companies have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience in testing pharmaceutical and other therapeutic products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and marketing and selling. If we ultimately obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we also will be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no commercial-scale experience. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in resources being even more concentrated by our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of our technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.\nOur cell therapy product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application, or BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that if any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider any of our therapeutic candidates to be\nIndex\nreference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nWe may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, processing and marketing of cell therapy products. Such liability claims may be expensive to defend and result in large judgments against us. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our current and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to any commercial sales of our products should they be approved. No product candidate has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore safety data is limited. Cell therapy companies derive the raw materials for manufacturing of product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. We presently have product liability insurance limited to $5 million per incident and $5 million in annual aggregate.\nWe will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing product candidates, if ever. At that time, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our financial position could be significantly impaired.\nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation that may arise, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, decreased demand for our products and injure our reputation.\nWe seek to maintain errors and omissions, directors and officers, workers' compensation and other insurance at levels we believe to be appropriate to our business activities. If, however, we were subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim from our own limited resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Additionally, liability or alleged liability could harm our business by diverting the attention and resources of our management and damaging our reputation.\nWe may be unable to retain key officers or employees or hire new key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses.\nGiven the specialized nature of cell therapy and that it is a relatively new field, there is an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. We are substantially dependent on the skills and efforts of current senior management for their management and operations, as well as for the implementation of our business strategy. In addition, our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business and administrative personnel) necessary to support our anticipated growth, develop our business, perform our contractual obligations to third parties and maintain appropriate licensure. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining personnel required by us to continue to grow our operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and/or retain skilled employees, as needed, could result in our inability to continue to grow our business or to implement our business strategy, or may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe company's internal computer systems, or those used by its clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for the company's product candidates.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, maintain laboratory and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Any significant degradation or failure of these computer systems could cause the combined company to inaccurately calculate or lose its data. Despite the implementation of security measures, these internal computer systems and those used by the combined company's clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. The techniques that could be used by criminal elements or foreign governments to attack these computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. While we have not experienced any such system failure, theft of information, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of the combined company's clinical development activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from historical\nIndex\nor future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption, theft of information, or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, the combined company could incur liability and the clinical development and the future development of its product candidates could be delayed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR MANUFACTURING BUSINESS\nCell therapy is in its early stages; it is still a developing field and a significant global market for manufacturing services may never emerge.\nCell therapy is in its early stages and is still a developing area of research, with few cell therapy products approved for clinical use. Many of the existing cellular therapy candidates are based on novel cell technologies that are inherently risky and may not be understood or accepted by the marketplace, making difficult their own funding to enable them to continue their business. In addition to providing in-house process development and manufacturing expertise for our own product candidates in development, PCT provides consulting and manufacturing of cell and tissue-based therapeutic products in clinical trials and processing of stem cell products for transplantation programs for third parties. The number of people who may use cell or tissue-based therapies and thus the demand for cell processing services is difficult to forecast. If cell therapies under development by us or by others to treat disease are not proven effective, demonstrate unacceptable risks or side effects or, where required, fail to receive regulatory approval, our manufacturing business will be significantly impaired. While the therapeutic application of cells to treat serious diseases is currently being explored by a number of companies, to date there are only a handful of approved cell therapy products in the United States. Ultimately, our success in deriving revenue from manufacturing depends on the development and growth of a broad and profitable global market for cell- and tissue-based therapies and services and our ability to capture a share of this market through PCT.\nPCT's revenues may vary dramatically from period to period making it difficult to forecast future results.\nThe nature and duration of PCT's contracts with customers often involve regular renegotiation of the scope, level and price of the services we are providing. If our customers reduce the level of their spending on research and development or marketing or are unsuccessful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues or other factors, our results of operations may be materially impacted. In addition, other factors, including the rate of enrollment for clinical studies, will directly impact the level and timing of the products and services we deliver. As such, the levels of our revenues and profitability can fluctuate significantly from one period to another and it can be difficult to forecast the level of future revenues with any certainty.\nWe have a finite manufacturing capacity at PCT, which could inhibit the long-term growth prospects of this business.\nWe currently provide services and produce materials for clinical trials at our existing manufacturing facilities in Allendale, New Jersey and Mountain View, California. We also produce material for our Phase 3 Intus trial at our Irvine, California facility. These facilities are intended and have been designed to be compliant with FDA cGMP, and cGTP requirements. While we believe these facilities provide us with sufficient capacity to meet our expected near term needs, it is possible that the demand for our services and products could exceed our existing manufacturing capacity. We expect as our own cell therapy development programs progress and demand for cell therapy services in the industry expand, it may become necessary or desirable for us to expand our manufacturing capabilities for cell therapy services and products in the future, which may require us to invest significant amounts of capital and to obtain regulatory approvals. In this regard, we are reviewing opportunities for expansion to both commercial level and international manufacturing capabilities. If we are unable to meet rising demand for products and services on a timely basis or unable to maintain cGMP compliance standards, then it is likely that our clients and potential clients will elect to obtain the products and services from competitors and that the progress of our own programs will be impaired which could materially and adversely affect the level of our revenues, prospects for growth and overall success of our development programs.\nComponents of therapeutic products approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Manufacturers of cell-based product candidates such as NBS20, NBS10 and NBS03D also must comply with cGTP. In addition, therapeutic products may be required to modify their manufacturing process from time to time in response to FDA requests. The manufacture of live cellular-based products is complex and subjects companies to significant regulatory burdens that may change over time. We may encounter difficulties in the production of our product candidates due to our limited manufacturing experience.\nWe will need to improve manufacturing efficiency at PCT in order to establish cost of goods levels that will permit approved products to succeed commercially.\nIndex\nPCT is working to improve the efficiency of cell therapy product development through the development of engineering and innovation solutions that think beyond current practices to develop long-term solutions to the unique challenges of cell therapy manufacturing with the ultimate goal of improving scale up, cost of goods quality control and robustness of the manufacturing process. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to develop process enhancements that are acceptable to the FDA, on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any expected improvement in profitability will be realized. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to develop these improvements, we may be unable to develop for ourselves or for our customers commercially viable products, and this inability would impair our ability to continue our operations.\nWe have a limited marketing staff and budget for our PCT operations, which could limit our ability to grow this business.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products and services depends upon a number of factors, including the strength of our sales and marketing support. If our marketing is not effective, our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired. The newness of the industry and capital constraints provide challenges to our marketing and sales activities at PCT, and the failure to attract a sufficient base of customers will affect our ability to increase our revenues and operate profitably.\nThe logistics associated with the distribution of materials produced by PCT are significant, complex and expensive and may negatively impact our ability to generate and meet future demand for our products and improve profitability.\nCurrent cell therapy products and product candidates, including our own, have a limited shelf life, in certain instances limited to less than 12 hours. Thus, it is necessary to minimize the amount of time between when the cell product is extracted from a patient, arrives at one of our facilities for processing, and is returned for infusion in the patient.\nTo do so, we need our cell therapy facilities to be located in major population centers in which patients are likely to be located and within close proximity of major airports. In the future, it may be necessary to build new facilities, which would require a significant commitment of capital and may not then be available to us. Even if we are able to establish such new facilities, we may experience challenges in ensuring that they are compliant with cGMP standards, FDA requirements, and/or applicable state or local regulations. We cannot be certain that we would be able to recoup the costs of establishing a facility in a given market. Given these risks, we could choose not to expand our cell processing and manufacturing services into new geographic markets which will limit our future growth prospects.\nTo effectively and efficiently deliver cell therapy product, we also need to establish and maintain cost-effective relationships with reliable and experienced transportation carriers. Most existing transportation carriers are not optimally designed for the transportation of cell therapy products. For example, these carriers generally lack a true point-to-point chain of control, may have non-controlled X-ray and inspection, do not guarantee package orientation, handling or storage conditions and, in many cases, lack a standard, documented and tracked operating procedures. While reliable ground carriers with experience in the transport of blood products exist in major U.S. metropolitan areas, air carriers meeting such needs are limited. If carriers we currently use should cease medical shipping operations or otherwise become unable to properly meet our transportation needs, the lack of access to safe, reliable and effective transportation options could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' and our own needs.\nIndex\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nThe development and commercialization of our product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals for our cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nTo date, we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. If we seek approval of any of our cell therapy product candidates, we will be required to submit to FDA and European and potentially other regulatory authorities extensive preclinical and clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as information about the manufacturing process and to undergo inspection of our PCT manufacturing facilities, among other things. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is expensive, generally takes many years and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, particularly with complex and/or novel product candidates such as our cell-based product candidates. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may make it easier for our competitors to gain regulatory approval to enter the marketplace. Ultimately, the FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our product candidate data are insufficient for approval without the submission of additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying agency interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAny of the following factors, among others, could cause regulatory approval for our product candidates to be delayed, limited or denied:\n\u009f\nthe product candidates require significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before applications for marketing approval can be submitted to the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u009f\ndata obtained from preclinical and nonclinical animal testing and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and regulatory authorities may not agree with our respective interpretations or may require us to conduct additional testing;\n\u009f\nnegative or inconclusive results or the occurrence of serious or unexpected adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate development efforts for a product candidate; and/or\n\u009f\nFDA and other regulatory authorities may require expansion of the size and scope of the clinical trials.\nAny difficulties or failures that we encounter in securing regulatory approval for our product candidates would likely have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to generate product sales, and could make any search for a collaborative partner more difficult.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to comply with applicable federal, state and international laws and regulations, which could result in loss of licensure, certification or accreditation or other government enforcement actions or impact our ability to secure regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nAlthough we seek to conduct our business in compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are exceedingly complex and often subject to varying interpretations. The cell therapy industry is the topic of significant government interest, and thus the laws and regulations applicable to our business are subject to frequent change and/or reinterpretation. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able, or will have the resources, to maintain compliance with all such healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such healthcare laws and regulations, as well as the costs associated with such compliance or with enforcement of such healthcare laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our operations or may require restructuring of our operations or impair our ability to operate profitably.\nFacilities engaged in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging or distribution of any HCT/Ps, or the screening or testing of a donor, are required to register with the FDA. Any third party retained by us to process our samples must be similarly registered with the FDA and comply with HCT/P regulations. We also are required to comply with FDA's cGTP regulations. If we fail to register or update registration information in a timely way, or fail to comply with cGTP regulations, we will be out of compliance with FDA regulations which could adversely affect our business.\nOur manufacture of certain cellular therapy products for ourselves or at PCT on behalf of our customers triggers additional FDA requirements applicable to HCT/Ps, or products comprised of HCT/Ps, which are regulated as a drug, biological product, or medical device. FDA's cGMP regulations govern the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of cell therapy products\nIndex\nregulated as drugs. FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, similarly governs the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of cell therapy products regulated as medical devices. We must comply with cGMP or QSR requirements including quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation for certain products. We may be unable to comply with these cGMP or QSR requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. These requirements may change over time and we or third-party manufacturers may be unable to comply with the revised requirements.\nIf we are unable to conduct clinical studies in accordance with regulations and accepted standards, we may be delayed in receiving, or may never receive, regulatory approvals of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nTo obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates in the United States and abroad, we must, among other requirements, complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory bodies that the product candidate is safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. If the FDA finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, due to, among other things, occurrence of a serious adverse event in an ongoing clinical trial, the FDA can place one or more of our clinical trials on hold. If safety concerns develop, we may, or the FDA or an institutional review board may require us to, stop the affected trials before completion. Our Phase 1 trial of NBS10 was subject to a clinical hold following the death of a subject in the study. We presented evidence that the death was the result of ventricular fibrillation attributed to recurrent myocardial infarction from stent thrombosis preceding infusion of NBS10 and the FDA lifted the clinical hold.\nThe completion of our clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated for a number of other reasons, including if:\n\u009f\nthird-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices required by the FDA and other regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u009f\ninspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or by institutional review boards of research institutions participating in the clinical trials, reveal regulatory violations that require the sponsor of the trial to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit use of some or all of the data in support of marketing applications; or\n\u009f\nthe FDA or one or more institutional review boards suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, or precludes enrollment of additional subjects.\nOur development costs will increase if there are material delays in our clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulation following any product approvals, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may suffer a significant setback in our business.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to the requirements of and review by, the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in the areas of manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, adverse event reporting, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, among other things. In addition, any marketing approval we receive may be limited in terms of the approved product indication or require costly post-marketing testing and surveillance. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or manufacturing process, or a failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u009f\nwarning letters or untitled letters or other actions requiring changes in product manufacturing processes or restrictions on product marketing or distribution;\n\u009f\nproduct recalls or seizures or the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from the market; and\n\u009f\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these actions would likely cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth care companies have been the subjects of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. There are numerous ongoing investigations of health care companies, as well as their executives and managers. In addition, amendments to the Federal False Claims Act, including under Healthcare Reform, have made it easier for private parties to bring \u201cqui tam\u201d (whistleblower)\nIndex\nlawsuits against companies under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that an action can be brought against any person or entity that has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback law, Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA, may be considered a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include substantial fines for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person or entity and/or exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, a majority of states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.\nWe are not aware of any government investigations involving any of our facilities or management. While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable governmental healthcare laws and regulations, any future investigations of our business or executives could cause us to incur substantial costs, and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\nIt is uncertain to what extent the government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our services relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by an increasing uninsured population and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States.\nTo the extent that health care providers cannot obtain coverage or reimbursement for our therapies and products, they may elect not to provide such therapies and products to their patients and, thus, may not need our services. Further, as cost containment pressures are increasing in the health care industry, government and private payors may adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to health care providers.\nSimilarly, the trend toward managed health care and bundled pricing for health care services in the United States, could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our therapeutic products under development.\nWe may receive a portion of our revenues from services rendered to patients enrolled in federal health care programs, such as Medicare, and we may also directly or indirectly receive revenues from federal health care programs. Federal health care programs are subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could materially decrease the range of services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for our products and services. To the extent that any health care reform favors the reimbursement of other therapies over our therapeutic products under development, such reform could affect our ability to sell our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe limitation on reimbursement available from private and government payors may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our products and services.\nFurthermore, there has been a trend in recent years towards reductions in overall funding for Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been an increase in the number of people who do not have any form of health care coverage in recent years and who are not eligible for or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The extent to which the reforms brought about under Healthcare Reform may be successful in reducing the number of such uninsured is unclear, and the reduced funding of governmental programs and increase in uninsured populations could have a negative impact on the demand for our services to the extent they relate to products and services which are reimbursed by government and private payors.\nUnintended consequences of healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the U.S., comprehensive programs are under consideration that seek to, among other things, increase access to healthcare for the uninsured and control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy. On March 23, 2010, healthcare reform legislation was approved by Congress and has been signed into law. While we do not believe this legislation will have a direct impact on our business, the legislation requires the adoption of implementing regulations, which may have unintended consequences or indirectly impact our business. For instance, the scope and implications of the amendments pursuant to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (\u201cFERA\u201d), have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business. Also, in some instances our clients may be health insurers that will be subject to limitations on their administrative expenses and federal review of \u201cunreasonable\u201d rate increases that could impact the\nIndex\nprices they pay for our services. If the legislation causes such unintended consequences or indirect impact, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitor companies or hospitals may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. This may in certain countries also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, advanced therapy medicinal products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient.\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules. Because any such sales would be made without a marketing authorization, there would be no need for the competitor company or hospital to refer to the clinical data in our marketing authorization dossiers, and so any data exclusivity protection that we may obtain for our products would not prevent such competing sales.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we, and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions, will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign laws;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our planned international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nIndex\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for new technologies, product candidates, products and processes and successfully defending such patents against third party challenges. To that end, we file patent applications, and have been issued patents, that are intended to cover certain methods and uses of stem cells, including very small embryonic-like stem cells, as well as compositions and methods relating to T regulatory cells and hematopoietic stem cells, and methods of making and using dendritic cell-based vaccines. These patent applications may never result in the issuance of patents.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions and recent court decisions have introduced significant uncertainty regarding the strength of patents in the industry. Moreover, the legal systems of some foreign countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any of the issued patents we own or license may be challenged by third parties and held to be invalid, unenforceable or with a narrower or different scope of coverage that what we currently believe, effectively reducing or eliminating protection we believed we had against competitors with similar products or technologies. If we ultimately engage in and lose any such patent disputes, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, we could be required to enter into third-party licenses or we could be required to cease using the disputed technology or product. In addition, even if such licenses are available, the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable or unaffordable to us.\nProduct development and approval timelines in the biotechnology industry are very lengthy. As such, it is possible that any patents that may cover an approved product may have expired at the time of commercialization or only have a short remaining period of exclusivity, thereby reducing the commercial advantages of the patent. In such case, we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the FDC Act, which may provide less protection to our competitive position.\nLitigation relating to intellectual property is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to protect against infringement by third parties or defend ourselves against claims of infringement.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we may initiate litigation or other proceedings. In general, intellectual property litigation is costly, time-consuming, diverts the attention of management and technical personnel and could result in substantial uncertainty regarding our future viability, even if we ultimately prevail. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or other proceedings more effectively than can we because of their substantially greater financial resources. The loss or narrowing of our intellectual property protection, the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or a finding that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party could limit our ability to develop or market our products and services in the future or adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, any public announcements related to such litigation or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThird parties may allege that the research, development and commercialization activities we conduct infringe patents or other proprietary rights owned by such parties. While we do not believe any of our current activities infringe the rights of others, we have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our pre-clinical or clinical research and development or activities may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. If we are found to have infringed the patents of a third party, we may be required to pay substantial damages; we also may be required to seek from such party a license, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue our activities. A judicial finding or infringement or the failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from commercializing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and our future prospects.\nTo obtain and maintain patent protection and licensing rights under certain of our license agreement, we must, among other things, ensure the timely payment of all applicable filing and maintenance fees. Any failure to do so could result in the loss of some or all of our rights to proprietary technology or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection.\nIndex\nAdditionally, our license agreements require us to meet certain diligence obligations in the development of the licensed products. Our failure to meet these diligence obligations could result in the loss of some or all of our rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets, our competitive position could be impaired.\nA significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained as trade secrets. We expend significant energy, resources and know-how in an effort to protect these trade secrets and know-how, including through the use of confidentiality agreement. Even so, improper use or disclosure of our confidential information could occur and in such case adequate remedies may not exist. The disclosure of our trade secrets and trade-secrets could impair our Company's competitive position.\nIn certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country.\nMany countries, including some countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving products is also becoming increasingly common in developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to our product candidates, which may limit our potential revenue opportunities, including with respect to any future revenues that may result from our product candidates.\nChanges to U.S. Patent Law may have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property rights.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, significantly changes United States patent law. It may take some time to establish what the law means, since it is just being interpreted by the lower courts, and any lower court decisions have not been reviewed by either the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, a process that will take years. The first major change is that AIA switches the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system. Now that the first to file system is in effect, there is a risk that another company may independently develop identical or similar patents at approximately the same time, and be awarded the patents instead of us. Further, for the second major change, AIA abolished interference proceedings, and establishes derivation proceedings to replace interference proceedings in all cases in which the time period for instituting an interference proceeding has not lapsed where an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed invention from a named inventor. Now that the derivation proceedings are in effect, there is a risk that the inventorship of any pending patent application can be challenged for reasons of derivation. The third major change is that AIA established post-grant opposition proceedings that will apply only to patent applications filed after \u201cfirst to file\u201d became effective. Post-grant opposition will enable a person who is not the patent owner to initiate proceedings in the Patent office within 9 months after the grant of a patent that can result in cancellation of a patent as invalid. Therefore there is a risk that any of our patents once granted after the effective date of these provisions of the AIA (March 16, 2013) may be subject to post-grant opposition, which will increase uncertainty on the validity of any newly granted patent or may ultimately result in cancellation of the patent.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents, trademarks and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices and trademark violations. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products and services. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products and services may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products and services. We have conducted freedom to operate analyses with respect to only certain of our products and services, and therefore we do not know whether there are any third-party patents that would impair our ability to commercialize these products and services. We also cannot guarantee that any of our analyses are complete and thorough, nor can we be sure that we have identified each and every patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant or necessary to the commercialization of our products and services. Because patent applications can take many\nIndex\nyears to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our products or services may infringe.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our products or services, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such products or services unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products or services. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STOCK\nOur stock price has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and in the future may continue to be highly volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 through March 2, 2015 our Common Stock traded as low as $3.08 per share and as high as $8.29 per share; in 2013, our common stock traded as low as $5.00 per share and as high as $9.89 per share.\nThe market price for our common stock is highly dependent on, among other things, our clinical development efforts the profitability and growth of our cell therapy services business and the growth of our business in general, the amount of our available cash and investments and our level of cash utilization. Future events could increase the volatility seen in our common stock and ultimately cause a significant decline in the price of our common stock and ultimately impact our ability to raise additional capital in the future. These events could include the following, among others:\n\u2022\nlow levels of trading volume for our shares;\n\u2022\ncapital-raising or other transactions that are, or may in the future be, dilutive to existing stockholders or that involve the issuance of debt securities;\n\u2022\ndelays in our clinical trials, negative clinical trial results or adverse regulatory decisions relating to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nadverse fluctuations in our revenues or operating results or financial results that otherwise fall below the market's expectations;\n\u2022\ndisappointing developments concerning our cell therapy services clients or other collaborators for our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nlegal challenges, disputes and/or other adverse developments impacting our patents or other proprietary rights that protect our products.\nIn addition, broader external events, such as news concerning economic or market conditions in the general economy or within our industry, the activities of our competitors, changes (or the threat of changes) in U.S. or foreign government regulations impacting the life sciences industry or the movement of capital into or out of our industry, are likely to affect the price of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not continue to fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIn addition to potential dilution associated with future fundraising transactions, we currently have significant numbers of securities outstanding that are exercisable for our Common Stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 36,783,857 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. In addition, there were outstanding stock options and warrants representing the potential issuance of an additional 7,978,232 shares of our Common Stock. The issuance of these shares in the future would result in significant dilution to our current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and the terms on which we could raise additional capital. In addition, the issuance and subsequent trading of shares could cause the supply of our Common Stock available for purchase in the market to exceed the purchase demand for our Common Stock. Such supply in excess of demand could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIndex\nSales of our Common Stock to Aspire Capital pursuant to our Purchase Agreement may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nThe Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC in March 2014, pursuant to which Aspire Capital committed to the purchase of up to $30 million of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock over the term of that Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nPursuant to the agreement, after Aspire Capital acquires shares under the Purchase Agreement, it may sell all or some of those shares. Sales to Aspire Capital by us pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Aspire Capital and the Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nDuring the course of testing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may identify and disclose material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that will have to be remedied. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal control may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain that adequacy or inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could result in our financial statements being unreliable, increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Additionally, failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could result in government investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nIndex", "PERMNO": 34666, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CLBS"}
