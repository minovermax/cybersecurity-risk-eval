RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. You should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our Company and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the market price of shares of our common stock and our ability to, among other things, satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders, which in turn could cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Properties\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to mitigate its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact on our tenants and rental revenue. We have observed the impact of COVID-19 manifest in the form of limited operations among our tenants, which has resulted, and may in the future result in, a decline in on-time rental payments and requests from tenants for temporary rental relief. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our future operational and financial performance, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, including the duration and intensity of the pandemic, the effectiveness, including the deployment, of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, the duration of government measures to mitigate the pandemic and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Given this uncertainty, we cannot accurately predict the effect on future periods.\nWhile the overall economy is showing signs of recovery from the initial impacts of COVID-19, workforce shortages, global supply chain bottlenecks and shortages, and inflation, as well as COVID-19 variants, are impacting the pace of the recovery. Even as governmental restrictions are lifted, our tenants may continue to be impacted by economic conditions resulting from COVID-19 or public perception of the risk of COVID-19, which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants' businesses and our tenants' ability to adequately staff their businesses. If the impacts of the pandemic continue, we expect that certain tenants will experience greater financial distress, which could result in additional tenants being unable to pay contractual rent (including deferred rent) on a timely basis, or at all, additional requests for rent relief, early lease terminations, tenant bankruptcies, decrease in occupancy, reductions in rent, or increases in rent concessions or other accommodations. In some cases, we may have to restructure tenants\u2019 long-term rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place. These factors also may adversely affect the value of our properties. The extent of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe primarily rely upon external sources of capital to fund acquisitions, development opportunities and repayment of significant maturities of principal debt, and, if we encounter difficulties in obtaining capital, we may not be able to repay maturing obligations or make future investments necessary to grow our business.\nWe primarily rely upon external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fund our capital needs, including acquisitions, development opportunities and repayment of debt maturities. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, difficulties obtaining the necessary capital to finance the pending Midtown Row Acquisition and service and refinance our existing\nindebtedness, including approximately $17.3 million of debt that matures in 2022 and approximately $75.4 million of debt that matures in January 2023, subject to two one-year extension options that are subject to certain conditions. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including general market conditions, the market\u2019s perception of our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, our current debt levels and the market price of the shares of our common stock, and our access to capital is currently constrained by our existing debt and the lack of an active trading market for our common stock. Economic, market and other disruptions worldwide, including in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets, could exacerbate the issues we have encountered obtaining financing.\nWe may not have access to capital in order to be able to refinance debt as it comes due, make debt service payments, acquire additional properties or pay dividends to our stockholders. In addition, although our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX Best Market (the \"OTCQX\"), an over-the-counter stock market, there is a very limited trading market for our common stock, and if a more active trading market is not developed and sustained, we will be limited in our ability to issue equity to fund our capital needs. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, satisfy our debt service obligations, acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, or make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nSubstantially all of the properties in our portfolio are located in the greater Mid-Atlantic and Colorado regions. Adverse economic or regulatory developments in this area could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThirteen of the 15 properties currently in our portfolio are located in the Mid-Atlantic region, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C., and two properties are located in the Denver, Colorado area. Of the two pending mergers, one of the properties is in the Mid-Atlantic region and the other is in the Denver, Colorado area. As a result of this geographic concentration, our business is dependent on the condition of the economy in these regions generally and the respective markets for retail real estate in particular, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. We cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of retail properties. Our operations may also be adversely affected if competing properties are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within any of our target markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in our markets, or any decrease in demand for retail space resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic fallout, the regulatory environment, business climate or fiscal problems, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe depend upon tenant leases for most of our revenue, and lease terminations and/or tenant defaults, particularly by one of our significant tenants, could materially and adversely affect the income produced by our properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe depend primarily upon tenant leases for our revenue. Our ability to sustain our rental revenue depends on the financial stability of our tenants, any of whom may experience a change in its business at any time. The ability of our tenants to fulfill their obligations under our leases may depend, in part, upon the overall profitability of their operations, and cash flows generated by certain tenant businesses may not be sufficient for a tenant to meet its obligations to us. Furthermore, certain of our tenants have experienced limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to mitigate its spread. See \u201c-The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to mitigate its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\u201d As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy and abandon the leased property. Any of these actions could result in a significant reduction or total loss of the revenue from the affected leases. In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property.\nIf significant leases are terminated or defaulted upon, we may be unable to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss. In addition, significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and insurance and maintenance costs, are generally fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.\nThe occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves one of our anchor tenants, could seriously harm our operating performance and materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nIf a tenant files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-bankruptcy amounts owed by that party. In addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate its lease with us, in which event we would have a general unsecured claim\nagainst such tenant that would likely be worth less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $180.1 million of outstanding indebtedness, including $13.1 million of preferred equity in the Sub-OP (as defined below), BSV Highlandtown (as defined below) and BSV Spotswood (as defined below) that is classified as indebtedness on our balance sheet. We expect to incur or assume an aggregate of $24.4 million in additional indebtedness in connection with the closings of the two pending Mergers. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness to fund the $122.0 million purchase price for our pending Midtown Row Acquisition. We may also need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our substantial indebtedness could have material adverse consequences to us, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to borrow additional funds as needed, on favorable terms or at all, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to meet operational needs and subject us to greater sensitivity to interest rate increases;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures from competitors that have relatively less debt than we have;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or result in refinancing terms that are less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness; and\n\u2022increasing our risk of defaulting under the terms of our existing indebtedness, in which case the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the applicable debt obligations and we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available on attractive terms or at all.\nIf any one or more of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nSecured debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt.\nEach property in our portfolio is, and the two properties we expect to acquire in the remaining Mergers will be and the pending Midtown Row Acquisition may be, subject to secured indebtedness. Mortgage and other secured debt obligations increase our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default. For example, we have two mortgage loans and a mezzanine loan on two properties totaling approximately $17.3 million, which mature during 2022, and the $66.8 million Basis Term Loan, which is secured by mortgages on six properties and matures in January 2023, subject to two one-year extension options that are subject to certain conditions. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance these loans on favorable terms, or at all, or exercise our extension options for the Basis Term Loan. If we are unable to refinance or extend the loans, the lenders will have the right to place their loans in default and ultimately foreclose on the properties. Any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of our portfolio of properties. For tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties that is subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds. If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nThe Basis Loan Agreement, the Sub-OP Agreement and the operating agreements of BSV Highlandtown and BSV Spotswood contain provisions that could significantly impede our operations and our ability to efficiently manage our business and that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future.\nEntities affiliated with Basis Management Group, LLC (\"Basis\") have substantial rights under the Basis Loan Agreement and the Sub-OP Operating Agreement (each as defined below), in particular, with respect to the properties owned by the Sub-OP, which secure the Basis Term Loan (as defined below). Similarly, Lamont Street Partners LLC (\"Lamont Street\") has substantial rights under\nthe operating agreements of BSV Highlandtown and BSV Spotswood. Under these agreements, the following are either prohibited or require the approval of Basis or Lamont Street, as applicable:\n\u2022the sale of properties owned by the Sub-OP (Avondale, Coral Hills, Crestview, Dekalb, Hollinswood, Midtown Colonial, Midtown Lamonticello, Vista Shops and West Broad), BSV Highlandtown (Highlandtown) or BSV Spotswood (Spotswood);\n\u2022any change in control of the Company (as defined in the applicable agreements), which, for the Sub-OP, includes any event in which Mr. Jacoby ceases to be our chairman and chief executive officer and actively involved in our daily activities and a competent and experienced replacement person is not approved by Basis within 90 days of him ceasing to serve in such roles;\n\u2022the incurrence of new indebtedness or modification of existing indebtedness by the entities;\n\u2022capital expenditures over certain thresholds on properties owned by the entities;\n\u2022any proposed change to a property directly or indirectly owned by the entities;\n\u2022direct or indirect acquisitions of new properties by the entities;\n\u2022the issuance of new membership interests in the entities;\n\u2022the entry into any new material lease or any amendment to an existing material lease with respect to the applicable properties; and\n\u2022decisions regarding the dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the entities.\nUnder certain circumstances, including in the event that their preferred interests are not redeemed on or prior to the redemption date, Basis and Lamont Street, as applicable, may remove the Operating Partnership as the manager of the applicable entities and their property-owning subsidiaries. In addition, if the debt service coverage ratio under the Basis Loan Agreement falls below 1.05x for two consecutive calendar quarters, the Basis Lender (as defined below) has the right to remove us as the manager of the six properties securing the Basis Term Loan. If the Basis Lender removed us as the manager of these properties, we would no longer manage the day-to-day operations of those properties.\nMoreover, if there is a default by the Company under the MVB Loan (as defined below), by Mr. Jacoby under his guarantee of the MVB Loan or by Mr. Jacoby under a certain personal loan as long as he has pledged OP units as collateral for such loan, and such default has not been waived or cured, then the Basis Lender will have the right to sweep the cash accounts of the property-owning entities that collect rental payments from the properties securing the Basis Term Loan on a daily basis in order for the Basis Lender to create a cash reserve that will serve as additional collateral for the Basis Term Loan. The Basis Lender also has the right to sweep those cash accounts if the debt service coverage ratio under the Basis Loan Agreement falls below 1.10x. If the Basis Lender exercises its right under the cash sweep provision, then our cash available for operations and other purposes would be significantly limited.\nBasis\u2019 and Lamont Street's rights may significantly impede our ability to operate our business and manage our properties. Furthermore, these rights may prevent us from engaging in transactions, including change of control or financing transactions, that otherwise would be attractive to us. The foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the market value of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future. In addition, failure to comply with any of these covenants, including the financial coverage ratios, could cause an event of default under or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nCovenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the restrictions provided in the Basis Loan Agreement and the Sub-OP Operating Agreement described above, other documents evidencing indebtedness contain certain financial covenants and affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among other things, with respect to insurance coverage and our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The MVB Loan Agreement (as defined below) also requires us to maintain (as such terms are defined in the MVB Loan Agreement (i) a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1, (ii) an EBITDA to consolidated funded debt ratio of at least 7.0% and (iii) an aggregate minimum unencumbered cash, including funds available under other lines of credit, of greater than $3.0 million. The Hollinswood mortgage, Vista Shops mortgage, Brookhill mortgage, Highlandtown mortgage, Cromwell mortgage, Spotswood mortgage, Greenwood mortgage and Lamar Station Plaza East mortgage require us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (as such terms are defined in the respective loan agreements) of at least 1.40x, 1.50x, 1.30x, 1.30x, 1.00x, 1.15x, 1.40x and 1.25x, respectively. These limitations may restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our common stock. In addition, failure to comply with any of these covenants, including the financial coverage ratios, could cause an event of default under or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere are conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, when preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management evaluates whether there are conditions or events that, when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In making its assessment, management considered the Company\u2019s current financial condition, liquidity sources and debt maturities, including the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest (as defined below) totaling approximately $75.4 million, which mature on January 1, 2023, subject to two one-year extension options that are subject to certain conditions. Management believes that we will meet the conditions necessary to exercise our extension options under the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest prior to their maturity. Management also is in discussions with other lenders to refinance the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest with new loans, which management believes will be available on acceptable terms based on discussions with lenders and the loan-to-value ratios of the properties securing the Basis Term Loan. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful in exercising these extension options or refinancing the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest prior to their maturity. If we are unable to extend or refinance the Basis Term Loan prior to maturity, the lender will have the right to place the loan in default and ultimately foreclose on the six properties securing the loan. If we are unable to extend or redeem the Basis Preferred Interest prior to the mandatory redemption date, the Preferred Investor may remove the Operating Partnership as the manager of the Sub-OP and as the manager of the property-owning entities held under the Sub-OP.\nAlthough management believes that we will be able to extend or refinance our debt prior to maturity, including the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest, it is possible that we may be unable extend or refinance such debt, which creates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of that the financial statements included in this report are issued, and our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our financial statements included in this report. Although the Basis Term Loan and the Basis Preferred Interest have two one-year extension options, those extension options are subject to certain conditions. If we are unable to exercise the extension options, we will be dependent on additional debt and/or equity financing to repay such obligations, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we will not be able to repay our debt at maturity, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. The financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur pending acquisitions are subject to conditions and may not close in a timely manner or at all.\nThe completion of each of the remaining two Mergers and the Midtown Row Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, obtaining the consent from the requisite lenders and refinancing certain indebtedness secured by the properties to be acquired in such transactions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to meet these conditions or obtain the necessary financing to close the remaining Mergers or the Midtown Row Acquisition. Therefore, there can be no assurance with respect to the timing of the closing of the remaining two Mergers or the Midtown Row Acquisition or that such transactions will be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the Mergers or the Midtown Row Acquisition, we will own a less diversified portfolio of properties and will have less rental revenue, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThere are inherent risks associated with real estate investments and with the real estate industry, each of which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and the value of our properties.\nBy owning our common stock, you are subject to the risks associated with the ownership of real properties, including risks related to:\n\u2022changes in national, regional and local conditions, which may be negatively impacted by concerns about the current COVID-19 pandemic and related economic fallout, inflation, deflation, government deficits, high unemployment rates, decreased consumer confidence, liquidity concerns and other adverse business concerns;\n\u2022changes in local conditions, such as an oversupply of, reduction in demand for, or increased competition among, retail properties;\n\u2022changes in interest rates and the availability of financing;\n\u2022the attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants; and\n\u2022changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing real estate usage, zoning and taxes.\nAny of these factors could adversely impact our financial performance and the value of our properties.\nOur dependence on smaller businesses to rent our space could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nMany of our tenants are smaller businesses that generally do not have the financial strength or resources of larger corporate tenants. Smaller independent businesses generally experience a higher rate of failure than larger businesses. As a result of our dependence on these smaller businesses, we could experience a higher rate of tenant defaults, turnover and bankruptcies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur growth will depend in part upon our ability to acquire additional retail properties for our portfolio, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying and consummating attractive acquisitions or taking advantage of other investment opportunities, which would impede our growth and materially and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our long-term business strategy and requires that we identify and consummate suitable acquisition or investment opportunities in retail properties for our portfolio that meet our investment criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. Our ability to acquire retail properties on favorable terms, or at all, may be adversely affected by the following significant factors:\n\u2022competition from other real estate investors, including public and private REITs, private equity investors and institutional investment funds, many of which have greater financial and operational resources and lower costs of capital than we have and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage;\n\u2022competition from other potential acquirers, which could significantly increase the purchase prices for properties we seek to acquire;\n\u2022we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete;\n\u2022even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfactory results of our due diligence investigations; and\n\u2022we have limited access to additional capital and may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, as a result of our existing indebtedness, market conditions or other factors. See \u201c-We primarily rely upon external sources of capital to fund acquisitions, development opportunities and repayment of significant maturities of principal debt, and, if we encounter difficulties in obtaining capital, we may not be able to repay maturing obligations or make future investments necessary to grow our business.\u201d\nOur failure to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions or take advantage of other investment opportunities without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems, would impede our growth and materially and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe terms of joint venture agreements or other joint ownership arrangements into which we may enter could impair our operating flexibility and subject us to risks not present in investments that do not involve co-ownership.\nUntil we have greater access to capital, we intend to make acquisitions through joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies or other syndicated or co-ownership arrangements entered into with affiliates or third parties. For example, as described above, Basis has substantial rights under the Sub-OP Operating Agreement, and Lamont Street Partners LLC has substantial rights under the respective operating agreements of BSV Highlandtown and BSV Spotswood. We may also enter into joint ventures to redevelop or develop properties. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present when acquiring real estate directly, including the following:\n\u2022a co-venturer, co-owner or partner may have certain approval rights over major decisions, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interests but opposed by our co-venturers, co-owners or partners;\n\u2022a co-venturer, co-owner or partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals, which are, or become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals, including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint venture or the timing of termination or liquidation of the joint venture;\n\u2022a co-venturer, co-owner or partner may become insolvent or bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining partners or members would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership or joint venture);\n\u2022we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our co-venturer, co-owner or partner;\n\u2022a co-venturer, co-owner or partner may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;\n\u2022agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a member\u2019s or partner\u2019s interest or \u201cbuy-sell\u201d or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms;\n\u2022disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable joint venture to additional risk; and\n\u2022under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached, which might have adverse effects on the joint venture and our relationship with our joint venture partners.\nIf any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nIn the future, if appropriate opportunities arise and subject to capital availability, we may acquire properties that are outside of our existing markets. Entering into new markets exposes us to a variety of risks, including difficulty evaluating local market conditions and local economies, developing new business relationships in the area, competing with other companies that already have an established presence in the area, hiring and retaining key personnel, evaluating quality tenants in the area and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. Furthermore, expansion into new markets may divert management time and other resources away from our existing markets. As a result, we may not be successful in expanding into new markets, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nMany of our operating costs and expenses are fixed and will not decline if our revenues decline.\nOur results of operations depend, in large part, on our level of revenues, operating costs and expenses. The expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenue from the property. As a result, if revenues or cash flows decline, we may not be able to reduce our expenses to keep pace with the corresponding reductions in revenues. Many of the costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance, loan payments and maintenance, generally will not be reduced if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues or cash flows to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nAdverse conditions in the general retail environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nWe are subject to factors that affect the retail sector generally, as well as the market for retail space. The retail environment and the market for retail space have been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies such as the weakness caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the adverse financial condition of some large retail companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, internet retailers and other online businesses. Increases in consumer spending via the internet may significantly affect our retail tenants\u2019 ability to generate sales in their stores. New and enhanced technologies, including new digital technologies and new web services technologies, may increase competition for certain of our retail tenants. Furthermore, we can provide no assurances that consumers\u2019 retail habits will return to norms that existed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our tenants may experience difficulties attracting customers to their stores even after the social-distancing measures are lifted.\nAny of the foregoing factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail properties. In turn, these conditions could negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nWe face considerable competition in leasing our properties and may be unable to renew existing leases or re-lease retail space on terms similar to the existing leases, or we may expend significant capital in our efforts to re-lease retail space, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, leases representing approximately 5.3% and 14.3% of our total annualized base rent are scheduled to expire by the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively, assuming no exercise of renewal options or early termination rights. In addition, approximately 11.9% of the square footage at our properties was available for rent as of December 31, 2021. We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment and leasing activities, including national, regional and local owners, operators, acquirers and developers. If our competitors offer retail space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates that we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants. Even if our tenants renew their leases or we are able to re-lease the space, the terms and other costs of renewal or re-leasing, including the cost of required renovations, increased tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, declining rental rates and other potential concessions, may be less favorable than the terms of our current leases and could\nrequire significant capital expenditures. If we are unable to renew leases or re-lease space in a reasonable time, or if rental rates decline or tenant improvement costs increase, leasing commissions or other costs increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations, ability to make distributions and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of the leases at our properties contain, and leases for properties that we may acquire in the future may contain, \u201cco-tenancy\u201d or \u201cgo-dark\u201d provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations or terminate their leases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our performance or the value of the affected retail property.\nCertain of the leases at our properties contain, and leases for properties that we may acquire in the future may contain, \u201cco-tenancy\u201d provisions that condition a tenant\u2019s obligation to remain open, the amount of rent payable by the tenant or the tenant\u2019s obligation to continue occupancy on certain conditions, including: (i) the presence of a certain anchor tenant or tenants, (ii) the continued operation of an anchor tenant\u2019s store and (iii) minimum occupancy levels at the retail property. If a co-tenancy provision is triggered by a failure of any of these or other applicable conditions, a tenant could have the right to cease operations, to terminate its lease early or to reduce its rent. In periods of prolonged economic decline, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a higher-than-normal risk that co-tenancy provisions will be triggered as there is a higher risk of tenants closing stores or terminating leases during these periods. In addition to these co-tenancy provisions, certain of the leases at our retail properties contain \u201cgo-dark\u201d provisions that allow the tenant to cease operations while continuing to pay rent. This could result in decreased customer traffic at the affected retail property, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at that property, which may result in our other tenants being unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. These provisions also may result in lower rental revenue generated under the applicable leases. To the extent co-tenancy or go-dark provisions in our retail leases result in lower revenue, tenants\u2019 rights to terminate their leases early, or a reduction of their rent, our revenues and the value of the affected retail property could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks associated with redevelopment and development activities could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may determine in the future to redevelop or develop certain properties directly rather than acquiring existing operating properties that meet our investment criteria. Large-scale, ground-up redevelopment or development of retail or mixed-use properties presents additional risks for us, including risks that:\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n\u2022we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor or other costs, such as litigation;\n\u2022we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a property on our anticipated schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in, or a delay in our receipt of, expected rental revenues;\n\u2022occupancy and leasing rates at a property may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development of competing properties;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development or redevelopment of a property, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity;\n\u2022we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in pursuing those opportunities;\n\u2022we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development or redevelopment process, for example, in connection with resident lease terminations or managing existing improvements on the site prior to resident lease terminations; and\n\u2022loss of a key member of a project team could adversely affect our ability to deliver development or redevelopment projects on time and within our budget.\nIn addition, capital improvements on our existing properties may divert cash that may otherwise be available for property acquisitions, dividends to our stockholders or for other purposes. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of redevelopment and development activities once undertaken, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe illiquid nature of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to changing economic, financial and investment conditions, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.\nAccordingly, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of our properties for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of our properties. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold, and we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. Our inability to dispose of assets at opportune times or on favorable terms could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase our interest expense and may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to service our indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $129.4 million in floating-rate indebtedness, and we may enter into debt instruments with variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt will increase our interest expense, unless we make arrangements to hedge the risk of rising interest rates. These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, increase the cost of financing or impair our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. An increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing.\nThe phase-out of London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate cap agreements.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for our Basis Term Loan, various of our mortgage indebtedness, our interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The administrator of LIBOR ceased the publication of the one-week and two-month LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited announced its plan to extend the date that the remaining U.S. LIBOR values would cease being computed and published from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It is expected that new contracts will not reference LIBOR and will instead use SOFR or other alternative reference rates. At this time, we cannot predict the effect of any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or if SOFR, or another alternative reference rate, will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement. As LIBOR phases out and ceases to exist, we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the lenders for debt using LIBOR as a reference rate, and as such the interest rate on any existing debt using LIBOR may change. The new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to the LIBOR phase-out. Furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses, and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR, all of which could negatively impact our cash flow.\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nWe have entered into hedging transactions to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and may enter into other hedging transactions in the future. Our hedging transactions include interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that (i) such arrangements would not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, (ii) a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable, (iii) hedging could actually increase our costs and reduce the overall returns on our investments, as interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates, (iv) counterparties to such arrangements would not perform, (v) we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, or (vi) the underlying transactions could fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Our failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution and ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur management team had no prior experience operating a public company prior to their appointment in December 2019, and we cannot assure you that the past experience of our senior management team will be sufficient to successfully operate as a public company.\nOur board of directors and senior management team have overall responsibility for the management of the Company and, while certain members of our senior management team and directors have extensive experience in real estate marketing, development, management, finance and law, few members of our senior management team and board of directors had prior experience in operating a public company prior to their appointment in December 2019. As a public company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy the company\u2019s periodic SEC reporting. We cannot assure you that management\u2019s past experience will be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate a public company.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remedy these material weaknesses, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As described under Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, we conducted our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as is set forth in Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December 31, 2021, the end of our last fiscal year. Our assessment noted that while remediation of the previously identified material weaknesses is in process, such remediation has not been completed nor have the remediated controls been in place for a sufficient amount of time to conclude as to their operating effectiveness. Consequently, the material weaknesses as noted previously remain at December 31, 2021 and our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Prior to the completion and as a result of the Mergers, we did not maintain appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the control environment, risk assessment procedures, and effective monitoring controls to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements. These material weaknesses contributed to additional material weaknesses within certain business processes and the information technology environment. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures-Material Weaknesses.\u201d Although these material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures.\nThe majority of the control improvement efforts have been completed as of December 31, 2021, with the remainder expected to be completed during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. While we believe that our efforts described under Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures-Remediation Plan\u201d will improve our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If the steps we take do not correct the material weaknesses in a timely manner, we will be unable to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The continued existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, any of which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nWe face possible liability for environmental cleanup costs and damages for contamination related to properties we acquire, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nBecause we own real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Under these laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real estate for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. In addition, new or more stringent laws or stricter interpretations of existing laws could change the cost of compliance or liabilities and restrictions arising out of such laws. The cost of defending against these claims, complying with environmental regulatory requirements, conducting remediation of any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could be substantial, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances on a property or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements may materially impair our ability to use, lease or sell a property, or to use the property as collateral for borrowing.\nUninsured losses relating to real estate and lender requirements to obtain insurance may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThere are types of losses relating to real estate, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, pollution or environmental matters, for which we do not intend to obtain insurance unless we are required to do so by mortgage lenders. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully covered by\ninsurance, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss. In addition, other than any reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and we cannot assure you that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for uninsured losses, we could suffer reduced earnings. In cases where we are required by mortgage lenders to obtain casualty loss insurance for catastrophic events or terrorism, such insurance may not be available, or may not be available at a reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. Additionally, if we obtain such insurance, the costs associated with owning a property would increase. If any one of the events described above were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCompliance with the ADA and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unexpected expenditures that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nUnder the ADA all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain U.S. federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines, an award of damages to private litigants and/or an order to correct any non-complying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further renovations of such properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. We have not conducted a detailed audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance, and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or other similar legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring such property into compliance, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to rebuild our properties to their existing specifications if we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of such properties.\nIn the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications. Further, reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. Environmental and legal restrictions could also restrict the rebuilding of our properties.\nWe depend on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed and each of whom would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the services of certain key personnel, particularly Michael Jacoby, our chairman and chief executive officer. Among the reasons that Mr. Jacoby is important to our continued success is that he has significant experience in acquiring, financing, owning, leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping commercial real estate properties. Our ability to acquire, manage, develop and redevelop and successfully integrate and operate retail properties, therefore, depends upon the significant relationships that Mr. Jacoby and other members of our senior management team have developed over many years. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Jacoby and Alexander Topchy, our chief financial officer, we cannot provide any assurance that they will remain employed by us. Our ability to retain our senior management team, or to attract and integrate suitable replacements should any member of the senior management team leave, is dependent upon the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, particularly Mr. Jacoby, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and industry personnel, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the Basis Loan Agreement prohibits us from engaging in certain change of control transactions. It is deemed a change of control under the Basis Loan Agreement if Mr. Jacoby ceases to be our chairman and chief executive officer and ceases to be actively involved in our daily activities and operations if Basis does not approve a replacement of Mr. Jacoby within 90 days of him ceasing to serve in such roles. If Mr. Jacoby were to no longer serve in his current roles, we could be declared in default under the Basis Loan Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has a very limited trading market, which limits your ability to resell shares of our common stock.\n\tAlthough our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX, there is a very limited trading market for our common stock, which limits your ability to resell shares of our common stock. The OTCQX quotation platform is an inter-dealer market that is less regulated than the major securities markets. There can be no assurances that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to sell their shares or the prices at which holders may be able to sell their shares.\nIn addition, all of the shares of our common stock that were issued in the Mergers were issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder. Those shares may not be offered or sold unless the offer and sale is registered under, or exempt from the registration requirements of, the Securities Act, and we do not intend to register the offer and sale of those shares. Pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, those shares may be transferred without registration only if we satisfy the current public information requirement of Rule 144, which requires that we have filed all required periodic reports under the Exchange Act during the 12 months preceding such sale. If we do not satisfy the current public information requirement of Rule 144, shares of common stock issued in the Mergers that have been completed to date cannot be transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nThe trading volume and market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you may have an illiquid investment.\nEven if a trading market develops and is sustained for our common stock, the market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. It may be difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares in the amount or at prices or times that they find attractive, or at all. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future, including as a result of factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In particular, the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u2022changes in our dividend policy;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry generally;\n\u2022increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher dividend yield;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022adverse market reaction to the amount of our outstanding debt at any time, the amount of our maturing debt in the near and medium term and our ability to refinance that debt and the terms thereof or our plans to incur additional debt in the future;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel, including our ability to find qualified replacements;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this report; and\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay or maintain cash dividends on our common stock or that dividends will increase over time.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stock and can provide no assurances regarding the payment of dividends in the future. Dividends will be authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion from time to time and will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022cash available for distribution;\n\u2022our results of operations;\n\u2022our financial condition, especially in relation to our anticipated future capital needs of our properties;\n\u2022the level of reserves we establish for future capital expenditures;\n\u2022customary loan covenants in certain of our debt agreements;\n\u2022our operating expenses; and\n\u2022other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe bear all expenses incurred by our operations, and our funds generated by operations, after deducting these expenses, may not be sufficient to cover dividends to our stockholders at desirable levels or at all.\nCommon stock eligible for future sale could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Mergers, we have issued 28,744,641 shares of common stock and 2,827,904 OP units and expect to issue an additional 1,317,055 shares of common stock and 573,529 OP units in the remaining two Mergers. OP units may be tendered by the holder for redemption in exchange for cash or, at our election, shares of common stock beginning on the first anniversary of issuance. Pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the shares of common stock issued to non-affiliates in the Mergers will become freely transferable by the holders thereof six months after issuance, subject to us meeting the current public information requirement under Rule 144. In addition, from time to time we may issue additional shares of common stock or OP units in connection with the acquisition of properties, as compensation or otherwise, and we may grant registration rights in connection with such issuances.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances and sales of our common stock and OP units, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of the common stock. Issuances and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or upon the exchange of OP units, or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of debt securities or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or future issuances of equity securities (including OP units), which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for purposes of making distributions, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the value of OP units.\nIn the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before common stockholders. If we incur additional debt in the future, our future interest costs could increase and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. We are not required to offer any additional equity securities to existing common stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional common stock issuances, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including OP units), warrants or options, will dilute the holdings of our existing common stockholders and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common stock. If we issue additional preferred stock, it would likely have a preference on dividend payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make dividends to our common stockholders. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, common stockholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIncreases in market interest rates may reduce demand for our common stock and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by the dividend yield on our common stock (i.e., the amount of our annual dividends, if any, as a percentage of the market price of our common stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently low compared to historical levels, may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield, which we may not be able, or may choose not, to provide. Higher interest rates would also likely increase our borrowing costs and decrease our operating results and cash available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nMessrs. Jacoby and Yockey own a substantial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis and may have the ability to exercise significant influence on our company.\nAs of April 8, 2022, Messrs. Jacoby and Yockey together owned approximately 16.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and 18.8% of the combined outstanding shares of common stock and OP units (which OP units may be tendered by the holder for redemption in exchange for cash or, at our election, shares of common stock beginning on the first anniversary of issuance). Furthermore, if all of the Mergers are completed, they will own 18.7% of the combined outstanding shares of common stock and OP units. In addition, Mr. Neal, a member of our board of directors, owned approximately 2.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of April 8, 2022. Consequently, certain members of our management and our board of directors, whose economic, tax or business interests or goals may be different or inconsistent with ours, may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder action, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including business combinations, consolidations and mergers.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of OP units in the Operating Partnership, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the Operating Partnership or any partner thereof (including certain of our executive officers and directors), on the other hand. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under Delaware law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, our wholly owned subsidiary, Broad Street OP GP, LLC, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, has fiduciary duties and obligations to the Operating Partnership and its limited partners under Delaware law and the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership (the \u201cOP Partnership Agreement\u201d) in connection with the management of the Operating Partnership. The general partner\u2019s fiduciary duties and obligations as the general partner of the Operating Partnership may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers the Company. Certain of our officers and directors are limited partners in the Operating Partnership.\nUnless otherwise provided for in a partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest. The OP Partnership Agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the separate interests of our stockholders, on the other hand, the general partner, in its capacity as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, shall act in the interests of our stockholders and is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership in deciding whether to cause the Operating Partnership to take or not to take any actions. The OP Partnership Agreement further provides that any decisions or actions not taken by the general partner in accordance with the OP Partnership Agreement will not violate any duties, including the duty of loyalty that the general partner, in its capacity as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, owes to the Operating Partnership and its partners.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations and, as such, we will rely on funds received from the Operating Partnership to pay any distributions to our stockholders, and the interests of our stockholders are structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. Apart from interests in the Operating Partnership, we do not have any material assets. As a result, we will rely on cash distributions from the Operating Partnership to pay any distributions our board of directors may declare on shares of our common stock. We also rely on distributions from the Operating Partnership to meet any of our obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from the Operating Partnership. In addition, because we are a holding company, claims of our stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and the Operating Partnership\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nOur board of directors may change its strategies, policies or procedures without the consent of stockholders, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.\nOur investment, financing, leverage and distribution policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without notice to or a vote of the stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those previously disclosed. Under these circumstances, we may be exposed to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest, provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our liquidity obligations and to make distributions to stockholders.\nCertain provisions in the OP Partnership Agreement may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us.\nProvisions in the OP Partnership Agreement may delay, or make more difficult, unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change in our control, although some of our stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022redemption rights;\n\u2022a requirement that the general partner may not be removed as the general partner of the Operating Partnership;\n\u2022transfer restrictions on OP units; and\n\u2022our ability, as the sole member of the general partner, in some cases to amend the OP Partnership Agreement to cause the Operating Partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change in control of us or the Operating Partnership without the consent of the limited partners.\nCertain of our directors, officers and employees have outside business interests that present conflicts of interest with us and may adversely affect our business.\nMessrs. Jacoby, Yockey, Topchy, Holden and Foster collectively own a 20.9% interest in an entity that is redeveloping a property that formerly was a part of our Midtown Colonial property into a mixed-use facility with retail on the ground floor and multi-family above. When the redevelopment is complete, we will manage the retail portion of the property. However, we will have no ownership interest in the property. As a result of their ownership interest in this entity, Messrs. Jacoby, Yockey, Topchy, Holden and Foster will have conflicts of interest. The retail portion of the property owned in part by Messrs. Jacoby, Yockey, Topchy, Holden and Foster may compete with properties we own, including the portion of Midtown Colonial that we own. Furthermore, our directors and officers may invest in other properties in the future that compete with properties owned by us.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event that we take certain actions which are not in our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur charter and bylaws obligate us to indemnify each present and former director or officer, and the OP Partnership Agreement requires us to indemnify the general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he, she or it is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his, her or its service to us or the Operating Partnership. In addition, we may be obligated to advance the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors granting them express indemnification rights. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers, than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter, bylaws and indemnification agreements or that might exist for other public companies.\nDelaware law could make a merger or tender offer difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally a stockholder, who together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of our voting rights) for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur bylaws contain provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management.\nOur bylaws contain provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management and may prevent a change in control of us that is in the best interests of our stockholders. Our bylaws provide that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all the shares then outstanding. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control that is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nTermination of the employment agreements with our executive officers could be costly and prevent a change in control.\nThe employment agreements that we entered into with Messrs. Jacoby and Topchy provide that, if their employment with us terminates under certain circumstances (including upon a change in our control), we may be required to pay them significant amounts of severance compensation, including accelerated vesting of equity awards, thereby making it costly to terminate their employment. Furthermore, these provisions could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium paid for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of certain agreements with members of our senior management and our affiliates because of our dependence on them and conflicts of interest.\nMessrs. Jacoby and Yockey entered into a representation, warranty and indemnification agreement with the Company and the Operating Partnership, pursuant to which they have agreed to indemnify the Company and the Operating Partnership for certain breaches of the representations and warranties of certain parties to the merger agreements for a period of one year following the closing of the Mergers. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under this agreement because of our desire to maintain ongoing relationships with Messrs. Jacoby and Yockey, which could have a negative impact on stockholders.\nFurthermore, Messrs. Jacoby, Yockey, Topchy and Neal have ownership interests in the property-owning entities that are party to the Mergers that have not closed. As a result, there are inherent conflicts of interest in the remaining Mergers. As a result of these\nrelationships, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the merger agreements for the remaining Mergers. Furthermore, our decision about whether or not to continue to pursue the closings of these Mergers could be impacted by these relationships.\nOur tax protection agreements could limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties.\nIn connection with the Mergers in which OP units were or will be issued as consideration, our Operating Partnership has or will enter into tax protection agreements that provide that if we dispose of any interest in the contributed properties in a taxable transaction prior to the seventh anniversary of the completion of such Mergers, subject to certain exceptions, we will indemnify the investors for their tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that exists with respect to such property interests as of the time of such Mergers and the tax liabilities incurred as a result of such tax protection payment. In addition, we may enter into similar tax protection agreements in the future if we issue OP units in connection with the acquisition of properties. Therefore, although it may be in our best interests that we sell one of these properties, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations.\nOur tax protection agreements may require our Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business.\nUnder our tax protection agreements, our Operating Partnership is obligated to provide certain OP unit holders the opportunity to guarantee debt or enter into deficit restoration obligations, including upon a future repayment, retirement, refinancing or other reduction (other than scheduled amortization) of currently outstanding debt prior to the seventh anniversary of the completion of such Mergers. If we fail to make such opportunities available, we will be required to deliver to each such OP unit holder a cash payment intended to approximate the investor's tax liability resulting from our failure to make such opportunities available to that OP unit holder and the tax liabilities incurred as a result of such tax protection payment. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist the investors in deferring the recognition of taxable gain as a result of and after such Mergers, and we may agree to similar provisions in the future if we issue OP units in connection with the acquisition of additional properties. These obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business.", "PERMNO": 69147, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "BRST"}
