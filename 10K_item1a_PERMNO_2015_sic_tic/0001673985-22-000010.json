Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K including, without limitation, statements under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in other parts of this Form 10-K regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). When used in this Form 10-K, words such as \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cbelieve,\u201d and other variations or similar terminology and expressions identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. They are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all information in this Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the overall economy, particularly in the United States but also globally, and in the capital, credit and commodities markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by difficult global economic conditions and significant volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy. Adverse events affecting the health of the economy, including inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, labor market shortages, trade conflicts including, export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers, the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics and the threat of war, sovereign debt and economic crises, terrorism and protectionism could have a negative impact on the health of the global economy. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions or on the stability of global financial markets which may affect us and our customers. For example:\n\u2022Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our sales and margins;\n\u2022As a result of volatility in commodity prices, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future price increases;\n\u2022Under difficult market conditions, there can be no assurance that access to credit or the capital markets would be available or sufficient, and as such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022Market conditions and credit availability could adversely affect the financial situation of raw material suppliers and their ability to deliver key materials, thus impacting our ability to run our production facilities at the intended rates; and\n\u2022Market conditions could result in our key customers experiencing financial difficulties and/or electing to limit spending, which in turn could cause fluctuations in demand for our products, product prices, volumes and margins potentially resulting in decreased sales and earnings.\nWe are unable to predict the duration of economic conditions or their effects on financial markets or our business and results of operations. Economic volatility and uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions may at times make it challenging to identify risk that may affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial conditions and results of operations. If economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe industries in which we operate experience cyclicality which can cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur historical operating results reflect the cyclical nature of the industries in which we operate including with respect to our Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam, nitrogen fertilizer, phenol and acetone products. We experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand for each of our products resulting in changes in selling prices and margins. Periods of high demand, tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increases in capacity and production until supply exceeds demand, generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices. While we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving\nproduction efficiency, by emphasizing higher margin products and by controlling transportation, selling and administration expense, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to offset fully the effect of possible decreases in pricing on our operating results. As a result of potential cyclicality, we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any historical period, including the most recent period shown in our operating results. Structural changes in industry and customer trends for our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant unplanned downtime or material disruption impacting any of our production facilities or logistics operations, or any third party on which we rely, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to run our complex production facilities on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency and we rely on the integrity of our logistics operations for the uninterrupted operations of our business. While we have made significant annual capital improvements at our manufacturing plants, operational issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to our manufacturing and production equipment and ancillary facilities. Unplanned interruptions in our production capabilities may adversely affect our production costs, product lead times and earnings during the affected period.\nAlthough our integrated manufacturing, scale and the quantity and range of our product offerings make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry, the significant level of integration across our manufacturing facilities exposes us to increased risk associated with unplanned downtime or material disruptions at any one of our production facilities which could impact our supply chain and our manufacturing process.\nWe seek to mitigate the risk of unplanned downtime through regularly scheduled maintenance for both major and minor repairs at all of our production facilities. We utilize maintenance excellence and mechanical integrity programs and maintain what we believe is an appropriate buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, both of which are intended to mitigate the extent of any production losses as a result of unplanned downtime. However, unplanned interruptions have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, and we may not have enough intermediate chemical inventory at any given time to offset production losses. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all costs or losses associated with unplanned downtime, or such insurance may not continue to be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, taking our production facilities offline for regularly scheduled repairs can be an expensive and time-consuming operation with risk that discoverable items and delays during the repair process may cause additional unplanned downtime. Any such unplanned downtime at any of our production facilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur production facilities and logistics operations, as well as those of our suppliers or other third parties on which we rely, are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss and material disruptions due to unanticipated events, such as unexpected repairs or other operational and logistical problems, severe weather conditions, personal injury or major accidents, prolonged power failures, chemical spills, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other natural disasters, that we or such third party may experience. While we seek to mitigate our risk of unplanned interruptions, we have experienced such unplanned interruptions in the past with respect to both our operations and the operations of third parties as described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and there is no assurance that we or other third parties on which we rely will not experience unplanned interruptions in the future. Depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption from any such event, the results could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRaw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost of raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, is a key element in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-based or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or commodity hedges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe that our sources of supply for raw materials are generally robust, it is difficult to predict the impact that shortages of raw materials or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead-time products during periods of fluctuating demand. Our inability to satisfy our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships.\nWhen possible, we have purchased, and we plan to continue to purchase, raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, through negotiated medium- or long-term contracts. To the extent we have been able to achieve favorable terms in our existing negotiated contracts, we may not be able to renew such contracts at the current terms or at all, and this may adversely impact our results of operations. To the extent the markets for our raw materials significantly change, we may be bound by the terms of our existing supplier contracts and obligated to purchase raw materials at disadvantaged terms as compared to other market participants.\nOur operations and growth projects require substantial capital and we may not be able to obtain additional capital that we need in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology, new products and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. Our capital projects and other growth investments may have lengthy deadlines during which market conditions may deteriorate between the capital expenditure\u2019s approval date and the\nconclusion of the project, negatively impacting projected returns on our investments. Delays or cost increases related to capital and other spending programs, including those relating to plant improvements and development of new technologies, could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted operating results. In addition, we may need to seek additional capital in the future, and debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional common equity, ownership in AdvanSix would be diluted. We believe that we have adequate capital resources to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. However, we may need additional capital resources in the future, and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus.\nThe continued spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting containment measures have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption globally and have had, and in the future may have, a material impact on the Company's results of operations.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated our industry as \"essential critical infrastructure\" during the response to COVID-19 for both public health and safety as well as community well-being. The Company takes its obligation to produce materials that support the broader population seriously, all while maintaining a prioritized focus on the health and safety of its employees and the communities in which it operates, and assuring the continuity of its business operations. As a global provider of products that are key inputs for our customers\u2019 processes serving a variety of end-markets, a pandemic presents obstacles that can adversely affect our supply chain effectiveness and efficiencies, our manufacturing operations and customer demand for our products and, ultimately, our financial results. In the second quarter of 2020, we experienced lower demand resulting from the economic impact of COVID-19, although demand improved to pre-COVID-19 levels in the second half of 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nThe extent of any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to: the scope and duration of the pandemic, including the spread of the virus and its variants, the extent of any resurgences, and the pace of recovery; the distribution, efficacy, availability and public acceptance of vaccines, boosters or treatments for COVID-19; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including our business continuity and cash optimization plans that have been, and may in the future be, implemented; the impact of social and economic restrictions and other containment measures taken to combat virus transmission; the impact on labor markets and our ability, and the ability of our suppliers and other third parties on which we rely, to retain and hire employees; inflationary pressures; supply chain disruptions; the effect on our customers\u2019 demand for our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture and deliver our raw materials, including implications of reduced refinery utilization in the U.S.; our ability to sell and provide our goods and services, including as a result of travel and other COVID-19-related restrictions; the ability of our customers to pay for our products; any closures of our and our customers\u2019 offices and facilities; risks associated with increased phishing, compromised business emails and other cybersecurity attacks and disruptions to our technology infrastructure; and risks associated with employees working remotely or operating with a reduced workforce.\nDue to difficult market conditions created by the pandemic, there can be no assurance that access to credit or the capital markets would be available or sufficient, and as such, if needed, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on reasonable terms, at a reasonable cost, or at all. As a result, these market conditions may impact our ability to comply with financial covenants in our credit facility, increase our cost of capital or make additional capital, including the refinancing of our credit facility, more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us, if at all. A sustained downturn may also result in the carrying value of our goodwill or other assets exceeding their fair value, which may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets. In addition, impacted financial markets and asset values may have the effect of increasing our pension funding obligations in order to ensure that our qualified pension plans continue to be adequately funded, which may divert cash flow from other uses. The effects of the pandemic may also impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting, including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAny of these events could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and/or stock price. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future pandemics, could also cause or contribute to the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, as may be amended in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and/or stock price. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay also affect our business, operations and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nFor additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity, see the discussions under \"Recent Developments - COVID-19\" in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur competitive position, as well as our failure to develop and commercialize new products or technologies to address our customers\u2019 needs and to effectively compete, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the industries we serve is based on factors such as price, product quality and service. Additionally, the markets for our products are characterized by significant competition, both regionally and internationally, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, customer price sensitivity, and disruptive product and manufacturing process innovations. In addition to changes in regulations, the impact of health, sustainability, and safety concerns could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use our products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to decreased demand for these products. Any of these factors could create pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely impact our business. As a result, our competitors may be able to deliver greater innovation, respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in market demand, allocate more resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products, successfully expand into emerging markets, improve their cost structures, or price their products more aggressively than us.\nOur continued ability to enhance our existing product offerings, as well as the successful development and commercialization of new products and technologies, are drivers to our future strategy. The development and commercialization of new products and technologies requires significant investment in R&D, capital expenditures, production and marketing. The sales and development cycle for our products is subject to customary budgetary constraints, internal acceptance procedures, competitive product assessments, scientific and development resource allocations, regulatory limitations, and other factors beyond our control. If we are not able to successfully accommodate these factors to enable customer development success, we will be unable to achieve sufficient sales to reach profitability and compete effectively. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify, develop, market or, in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for, new products in a timely manner or at all, as may be required to replace or enhance existing products. We cannot be certain that costs incurred by investing in new products and technologies will result in an increase in our revenues or profits. Our ability to keep pace with our competitors and the success of any new products and technologies is uncertain and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on significant customers, many of whom have been doing business with us for decades. The loss of one or several significant customers may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2021, our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our total sales across all product lines. Our largest customer is Shaw, one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam. We sell caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin to Shaw under a long-term agreement. We typically sell to other customers under master services agreements, with primarily one-year terms, or by purchase orders. If our sales to any of our significant customers were to decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of our products. The loss of one or several of our significant customers, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by any of them, or significant unfavorable changes to pricing or other terms in contracts with any of them, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to credit risk associated with customer concentration. If one or more of our largest customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise were unable to pay for our products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to concerns related to terrorism, we are subject to various security laws including MTSA regulations. Our Frankford and Hopewell facilities are regulated facilities under MTSA due to the nature of our operations and the proximity of the facilities to adjacent waterways. Federal, state, local and foreign governments could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers or other chemicals. These regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs, lower sales and reduced profit margins. It is possible that federal, state, local and foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use, sale or distribution of chemicals we produce and sell, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products, or that illicit use of our products could result in potential exposure for us. The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general, and the markets for our products in particular. The resulting damage from an attack on our assets could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive.\nHazards and compliance costs associated with chemical manufacturing, storage and transportation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and could have an adverse effect on the productivity\nand profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or on us as a whole. While we endeavor to provide adequate protection for the safe handling of these materials, issues could be created by various events, including natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage, human error, and performance by third parties, and as a result, we could face potential hazards such as piping and storage tank leaks and ruptures, mechanical failure, employee exposure to hazardous substances and chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines, work stoppage injunctions, lawsuits by injured persons, damage to our public reputation and brand and diminished product acceptance. If such actions are determined to be adverse to us or there is an associated economic impact to our business, we may have inadequate insurance or cash flow to offset any associated costs. Such outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.\nWe face risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental or other torts or otherwise. We have noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental or other torts without claiming present personal injuries. We also have noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public.\nVarious factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlements or changes in applicable law. An adverse outcome or unfavorable development in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results and could adversely impact the value of any of our brands associated with any such matters.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. Additionally, we may be required to indemnify Honeywell for amounts related to liabilities allocated to, or assumed by, us in connection with our spin-off. If we are required to make any such payments, the payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition, strategic relationship, joint venture or investment could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. Our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies or realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe actively evaluate acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, collaborations, and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, broaden our technology and intellectual property or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. Any of these transactions may be complex, time consuming and expensive, and may present numerous challenges and risks. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Commonwealth Industrial Services, Inc., and in February 2022, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire U.S. Amines, Ltd.\nLack of control over the actions of our business partners in any strategic relationship, joint venture or collaboration, could significantly delay the introduction of planned products or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to realize the expected benefits of such relationship. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues. Additionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur unanticipated expenses, write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names and trade dress, are important to our business. We will endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in such key jurisdictions. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention and we may not prevail in any resulting suits or proceedings.\nWe also rely materially upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we institute and maintain policies, internal security measures, and agreements to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property, any failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.\nWe may be required to make significant cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan under which certain eligible AdvanSix employees who were employed by Honeywell prior to the spin-off earn pension benefits as if they remained employed by Honeywell. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, retirement rates and other factors could require unplanned cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different from our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Our pension contributions may be material and could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We made pension contributions of approximately $17.5 million in 2021, which satisfied our pension funding requirements for such period, and we plan to make pension contributions in future periods sufficient to satisfy funding requirements.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions and our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.\nApproximately 705 of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2023 and 2025, which represents approximately 51% of our employee-base as of December 31, 2021. From time to time, we engage in negotiations to renew collective bargaining agreements as those contracts are scheduled to expire. While we generally have positive relationships with our labor unions, we cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. We may experience work stoppages, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and, ultimately, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the complex nature of our manufacturing business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel, scientists and our senior management team, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new, qualified employees or adequately train employees, or any delay in hiring key personnel, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity threats and incidents continue to increase in frequency and sophistication. A successful cybersecurity attack could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, and adversely impact our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at AdvanSix, its plants and operations, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers including cloud providers. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage IT systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Our information technology infrastructure, including cybersecurity controls, deploys comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. We track cyber performance metrics and conduct training of our employees on protective measures regarding information security, data privacy, cyber-attacks and recognizing phishing attempts. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of our plant operations and business generally or the disruption of the operations and businesses of our vendors or customers. Additionally, we use third-party vendors that may store sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. While our standard vendor terms and conditions include certain safeguards, including requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, a breach at these third-party vendors may occur. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident of our own systems or the systems of those with whom we do business, include reputational consequences, safety risk, physical damage to our assets, claims from and litigation with third parties, fines levied by governmental authorities, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness, plant operations, business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain cyber liability insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident.\nData privacy, information security and protection of confidential information may require significant resources and present certain risks.\nWe maintain, have access to and process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information, that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information and data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, or errors by employees or third-party providers that could potentially cause such information and data to be compromised, or lead to improper use of our systems or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, and operational disruptions. In addition, there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including the General and Data Protection Regulations implemented in the European Union, and we must comply with all applicable laws and standards. Noncompliance with these laws can result in reputational damage, fines and penalties, and enforcement proceedings and litigation, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in transportation or significant changes in transportation costs could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on third party transportation to deliver raw materials to our facilities and ship products to our customers. Transport operators are exposed to various risks, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, work stoppages, personnel shortages, and operating hazards, as well as interstate and international transportation requirements. If we experience transportation problems, or if there are other significant changes in the cost of these services, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship products to our customers. We also seek to maintain appropriate buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, which are intended to mitigate the extent of any delays or disruptions in supply chain logistics. However, our failure to obtain raw materials, ship products or maintain sufficient buffer inventory could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExposure to risks and events beyond our control could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks from various events that are beyond our control, which may have significant effects on our results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through appropriate loss prevention measures, insurance, business contingency planning and other means, we may not be able to anticipate all risks or to reasonably or cost-effectively manage those risks that we do anticipate. We maintain property, cyber liability, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks, loss, damages or expenses associated with our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and limits on the liabilities covered. Consequently, our operations could be adversely affected by circumstances or events in ways that are significant and/or long lasting. The risks and uncertainties identified herein are not the only risks that we have. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. If any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe are a borrower of funds under a credit facility. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations or financings. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the terms of our indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u2022 Incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022 Pay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022 Make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022 Sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022 Create liens;\n\u2022 Enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 Enter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022 Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022 Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 Prepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022 Issue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u2022 Significantly change the nature of our business.\nThese restrictions may impact our current and future operations, how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, as well as our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives associated with our strategy, ongoing operations, competitive industry dynamics and new business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of this indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt and the event of default or acceleration may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. Substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are pledged as collateral to secure the obligation under our credit facility and, in the event we were unable to repay any amount of this indebtedness when due and payable, the lenders could proceed against the pledged collateral. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our credit facility currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. Certain USD LIBOR rates ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021 while the remaining USD LIBOR rates will cease to be published on June 30, 2023, as announced by LIBOR's regulators and administrators. In response to the phase-out of LIBOR, regulators have suggested reforming or replacing LIBOR with other benchmark rates. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could cause volatility or disruption in the overall financial market, result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or adversely affect our cost of funding, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while our credit facility contains a provision providing for an alternative rate calculation in the event LIBOR is unavailable, this provision may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or successor rates.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nExtensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including initiatives related to discharges into the air and water, hazardous waste, sustainability, global warming and climate change, may result in substantial costs and unanticipated loss or liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. If we are found to be in violation of these laws or regulations, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation and Environmental Matters\u201d for more information on the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nPrimarily because of past operations at our current manufacturing locations and other locations used in our operations as currently conducted, we may be subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may have been or may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures or other hazardous conditions. Lawsuits, claims and costs involving these matters may arise in the future. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations or changes in regulations, including discharges into the air and water, handling and disposal of hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater, and greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) and water nutrient regulations. Due to the concerns about risks associated with air, water, global warming and climate change, more stringent regulations may require us to incur additional capital expenditures or make changes to our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If enacted, more stringent GHG limitations are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our production process. To the extent that GHG or other restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us. In addition, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Consequently, legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHG could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods. Extreme weather conditions have and in the future may interfere with our operating activities, disrupt our maritime logistics and intraplant supply chain, increase our costs of operations or reduce the efficiency of our operations, and potentially increase costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such conditions. Long-term, higher average global temperatures could result in changes in natural resources, growing seasons, precipitation patterns, weather patterns, species distributions, water availability, sea levels, and biodiversity. These impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain our production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs in the future. We continually assess our manufacturing plants for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change. We are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants to understand potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship.\nThere is also a risk that one or more of our key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have, or be characterized as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees, which could potentially result in us incurring liability in connection with such characterization and the associated effects of any toxicological or health-related impact. If such a discovery or characterization occurs, we may incur increased costs to comply with new regulatory requirements, or the relevant materials or products, including products of our customers that incorporate our materials or products, may be recalled or banned. Changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretations, and our customers\u2019 perception of such changes or interpretations may also affect the marketability of certain of our products. Additionally, sales of acetone, which is a List II Chemical under TSCA, are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Act. This classification subjects us to periodic audits by the Drug Enforcement Administration and ongoing restrictions on our acetone sales activities.\nHeightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and may cause certain of our key stakeholders to require that we meet certain standards, including customers or suppliers who may impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them, all of which could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use our products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to decreased demand for these products.\nOur operations are dependent on numerous required permits and approvals.\nWe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. In addition, any expansion or major modification of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have an adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility, or facilities, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to adverse trade policies inherent in international sales and associated regulations in certain important markets for our products.\nWe have exposure to risks inherent in international sales, including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations including customs and international trade laws; unexpected changes in political or regulatory environments; earnings and cash flows that may be subject to tax withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; political and economic instability; import and export restrictions, tariffs, and other trade barriers or retaliatory actions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; government takeover or nationalization of business; and government mandated price controls. These considerations limit the countries in which we can do business, the persons or entities with whom we can do business, the products which we can buy or sell, and the terms under which we can do business. As a U.S.-based producer, we are impacted by anti-dumping investigations which have had, and may continue to impose, significant anti-dumping duties on our products. Such duties place us at a significant competitive disadvantage in the applicable markets. In each case, we diligently evaluate our commercial and legal options to defend these investigations and their subsequent sunset reviews and take steps we feel are prudent to protect our interests, including our filing anti-dumping petitions covering imports of acetone with the International Trade Commission in February 2019 (see \"Anti-Dumping Duty Petitions\" under Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d). Historically, we have successfully mitigated these risks through geographical mix management so that the imposition of duties does not materially affect our business results. However, such duties could have an adverse effect on the sales of key product lines and affect our business performance in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that, in the future, any governmental or international trade body will not institute trade policies or remedies that are adverse to exports from the United States, and given the change in the U.S. presidential administration, we may face additional uncertainty with regard to U.S. government trade policy. In recent years, the U.S. imposed tariffs on certain U.S. imports, and China and other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. exports. Any significant changes in international trade policies, practices or trade remedies, especially those instituted in our target markets or markets where our major customers are located, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which became effective in July 2020, could potentially increase the price of our products relative to our competitors or decrease our customers\u2019 demand for our products, which in turn may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our ability to meet our reporting requirements.\nWe are required, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. This includes performing system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with auditor attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are not able to comply with these requirements, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to penalties or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail\nto maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nThe ongoing process of implementing internal controls requires significant attention from management and we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur spin-off could result in significant tax liability.\nCompletion of our spin-off was conditioned on Honeywell\u2019s receipt of a written opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP to the effect that the October 1, 2016 distribution by Honeywell of all of the then outstanding shares of AdvanSix common stock should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Code. The opinion of counsel did not address any U.S. state, local or foreign tax consequences of the spin-off. The opinion was based on numerous assumptions and on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by Honeywell and us. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Honeywell did not request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the spin-off.\nIf the distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355(e) of the Code, our U.S. stockholders could be subject to tax. In this case, each U.S. stockholder who received our common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as having received a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received, which would generally result in (1) a taxable dividend to the U.S. stockholder to the extent of that U.S. stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of Honeywell\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (2) a reduction in the U.S. stockholder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in its Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits; and (3) a taxable gain from the exchange of Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. stockholder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits and the U.S. stockholder\u2019s basis in its Honeywell common stock. A discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off can be found in our Form 10.\nIf, due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, it were determined that the distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Code, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and investments in our stock could lose value.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022Success or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022Competition and industry capacity;\n\u2022Changes in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;\n\u2022Our level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022Our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock;\n\u2022Our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\n\u2022Our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022The operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022Investor perception of our company and our industry;\n\u2022Overall market fluctuations and volatility unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u2022Results from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022Changes in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022Changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022General economic conditions and other external factors.\nGeneral or industry-specific market conditions, stock market performance or macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Volatility in our stock price could expose us to litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. In addition, repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness. Furthermore, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, declaration, amount or payment of any dividends, and the terms of our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the sole discretion of our Board. Among the items considered when establishing a dividend policy will be the capital intensive nature of our business and opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth. Additionally, the terms of our indebtedness limit our ability to pay cash dividends. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nStockholder percentage ownership in AdvanSix may be diluted in the future.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in AdvanSix may be diluted in the future because of common stock-based equity awards that we have granted and expect to grant in the future to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity to raise capital to finance our ongoing operations or as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our Board. These include, among others, provisions that do not permit our stockholders to act by written consent, establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals, limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders, and limit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders. These and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of AdvanSix, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.", "PERMNO": 16276, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "ASIX"}
