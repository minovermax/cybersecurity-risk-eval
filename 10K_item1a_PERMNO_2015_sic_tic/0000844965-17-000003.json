Risk Factors.\nCertain Business Risks\nAlthough it is not possible to identify all of the risks we encounter, we have identified the following significant risk factors that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from any such results that might be projected, forecasted, or estimated by us in this report.\nMarket Risks\nThe demand and prices for our products and services are affected by several factors, including the supply, demand, and prices for oil and natural gas.\nDemand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Crude oil prices have fluctuated significantly since 2014, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil spot prices declining from a high of $108 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26.19 per barrel in February 2016, a level which has not been experienced since 2003. Although crude oil prices increased during the second half of 2016 to a high of $54.01 per barrel in December 2016, market reports indicate prices are not expected to increase materially in 2017. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Environment and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices depressed levels of exploration, development, and production activity in 2015 and 2016, and if the depressed oil and natural gas prices continue, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Should current market conditions worsen or persist for an extended period of time, we may be required to record additional asset impairments. Such potential impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include: the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas; governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; weather conditions and natural disasters; worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain oil production levels; the levels of oil production by non-OPEC countries; oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and potential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels.\nWe encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, intense competition in the sale of our products and services.\nWe compete with numerous companies in each of our operating segments, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Certain of our competitors have lower standards of quality and older equipment and safety, and offer services at lower prices than we do. Other competitors have newer equipment that is better suited to our customers' needs. Particularly during the current period of low oil and natural gas pricing, to the extent competitors offer products or services at lower prices or higher quality, or more cost-effective products or services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain of our customers may elect to perform services internally in lieu of using our services, which could also materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe profitability of our operations is dependent on other numerous factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results in general, and gross profit in particular, are determined by market conditions and the products and services we sell in any period. Other factors, such as heightened competition, changes in sales and distribution channels, availability of skilled labor and contract services, shortages in raw materials, or inability to obtain supplies at reasonable prices, may also affect the cost of sales and the fluctuation of gross margin in future periods.\nOther factors affecting our operating results and activity levels include oil and natural gas industry spending levels for exploration and production, development, and acquisition activities, impairments of long-lived assets, and plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning costs on Maritech\u2019s remaining offshore production platforms, wells, and pipelines. Several of our customers reduced their capital expenditures in 2016 and have publicly announced further reductions in their capital expenditure plans for 2017 in light of the significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas, and such reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for many of our products and services. This has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. A large concentration of our operating activities is located in the onshore and offshore U.S. Gulf Coast region. Our revenues and profitability are particularly dependent upon oil and natural gas industry activity and spending levels in this region. Our operations may also be affected by technological advances,\ncost of capital, and tax policies. Adverse changes in any of these other factors may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in the economic environment have resulted, and could further result, in further significant impairments of certain of our long-lived assets and goodwill.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of the impact of significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices on certain of our long-lived assets, we recorded consolidated long-lived asset impairments of approximately $7.2 million. During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded additional consolidated long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill impairments) of approximately $10.7 million. During the two year period ending December 31, 2016, we have recorded a total of $62.3 million of long-lived asset impairments. A continuation of the depressed commodity prices and/or further adverse changes in the economic environment could result in a greater decrease in the demand for many of our products and services, which could impact the expected utilization rates of certain of our long-lived assets, including plant facilities, operating locations, barges and vessels, and other operating equipment. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, based on their expected future cash flows. The impact of reduced expected future cash flow could require the write-down of all or a portion of the carrying value for these assets, which would result in additional impairments, resulting in decreased earnings.\nDue to decreases in our stock price and CCLP's common unit price and the expected future cash flows from certain of our reporting units, we recorded approximately $106.2 million of goodwill impairments during the fourth quarter of 2016. During the two year period ending December 31, 2016, we have recorded a total of approximately $283.2 million of goodwill impairments. Following these goodwill impairments, as of December 31, 2016, our consolidated goodwill consists of the $6.6 million of goodwill attributed to our Fluids reporting unit. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review the carrying value of our goodwill for possible impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Changes in circumstances indicating the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or the price of CCLP's common units, or future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. If economic and market conditions decline further, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe demand for our products and services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could continue to be adversely impacted by increased regulation and continuing regulatory uncertainty.\nOperations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been subject to an increasingly stringent regulatory environment including government regulations focused on offshore operating requirements, spill cleanup, and enforcement matters. These regulations also implement additional safety and certification requirements applicable to offshore activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Demand for our products and services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to be affected by these regulations. Future regulatory requirements could delay our customers\u2019 activities, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for specific products and equipment necessary to provide certain of our products and services.\nWe sell a variety of clear brine fluids to the oil and gas industry and non-energy markets, including calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and formate-based brines, some of which we manufacture and some of which are purchased from third parties. Sales of these products contribute significantly to our revenues. In our manufacture of calcium chloride, we use brines, hydrochloric acid, and other raw materials purchased from third parties. In our manufacture of brominated clear brine fluid products, we use elemental bromine, hydrobromic acid, and other raw materials that are purchased from third parties. We rely on Chemtura Corporation as a supplier of bromine for our brominated clear brine fluid products as well as tail brine for our El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant. Although we have long-term supply agreements with Chemtura, if we were unable to acquire these raw materials at reasonable prices for a prolonged period, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of the well plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning services performed by our Offshore Services segment require the use of vessels, diving, cutting, and other equipment, and services provided by third parties. We lease equipment and obtain services from certain providers, and there can be no assurance that this equipment and these services will be available at reasonable prices in the future.\nThe fabrication of our compression packages, pump systems, and production testing, well monitoring, and rig cooling equipment requires the purchase of various components, some of which we obtain from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to the risk of price increases, inferior component quality, or an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. The profitability or future growth of our Compression and Production Testing Divisions may be adversely affected due to our dependence on these key suppliers.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace, and the continued ability to attract new employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain skilled management and employees at reasonable compensation levels. The delivery of our products and services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled managers and workers in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and other regions in which we operate is high and the supply is limited. Reductions in employee compensation that were put into effect during 2016 could lead to increased turnover and loss of key personnel. A lack of qualified personnel, could adversely affect operating results.\nOperating, Technological, and Strategic Risks\nWe may not fully realize the benefits from the CSI Acquisition.\nAs a result of the significant decline in oil and gas prices since the CSI Acquisition, we do not expect to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the CSI Acquisition. In addition, a portion of the expected benefits may not be realized if we are unable to fully and efficiently integrate the business and operations of CSI. While significant steps to integrate and consolidate operations functions have been accomplished, the integration of certain administrative functions has yet to be completed. We are currently converting and consolidating CSI's financial accounting, operating, and information systems environment into our system environment. There can be no assurances that these system integration efforts will accomplish all the targeted efficiencies, or that they will not be more costly or take longer to accomplish than what we currently estimate.\nWe performed an inspection of the assets to be acquired, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, there could be environmental or other problems that are not necessarily observable even when the inspection is undertaken. If problems are identified after closing of the CSI Acquisition, the stock purchase agreement provides for limited recourse against the seller.\nWe have technological and age-obsolescence risk, both with our products and services as well as with our equipment assets.\nNew drilling, completion, and production technologies and equipment are constantly evolving. If we are unable to adapt to new advances in technology or replace older assets with new assets, we are at risk of losing customers and market share. In particular, many of our significant equipment assets, including one of our heavy lift barges and certain dive support vessels, are approaching the end of their useful lives, which may adversely affect our ability to serve certain customers. Other equipment, such as a portion of our production testing equipment fleet, may be inadequate to meet the needs of our customers in certain markets. The permanent replacement or upgrade of any of our vessels or equipment will require significant capital. Due to the unique nature of many of these assets, finding a suitable or acceptable replacement may be difficult and/or cost prohibitive. The replacement or enhancement of these assets over the next several years may be necessary in order for us to effectively compete in the current marketplace.\nWe face risks related to our long-term growth strategy.\nOur long-term growth strategy includes both internal growth and growth through acquisitions. Internal growth may require significant capital expenditures, some of which may become unrecoverable or fail to generate\nan acceptable level of cash flows. Internal growth also requires financial resources (including the use of available cash or additional long-term debt), management, and personnel resources. Acquisitions also require significant management resources, both at the time of the transaction and during the process of integrating the newly acquired business into our operations. If we overextend our current financial resources by growing too aggressively, we could face liquidity problems or have difficulty obtaining additional financing. Acquisitions could adversely affect our operations if we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired companies into our operations, are unable to hire adequate personnel, or are unable to retain existing personnel. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms. Acquisition or internal growth assumptions developed to support our decisions could prove to be overly optimistic. Future acquisitions by us could result in issuances of equity securities or the rights associated with the equity securities, which could potentially dilute earnings per share. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. These factors could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position.\nOur operations involve significant operating risks and insurance coverage may not be available or cost-effective.\nWe are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the oilfield service industry, including automobile accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, formation collapse, mechanical problems, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental accidents. Environmental accidents could include, but are not limited to oil spills, gas leaks or ruptures, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, or well fluids, or discharges of CBFs or toxic gases or other pollutants. These operating hazards may also include injuries to employees and third parties during the performance of our operations. Our operation of marine barges and vessels, heavy equipment, offshore production platforms, chemical manufacturing plants, and the performance of heavy lift and diving services involve particularly high levels of risk. In addition, certain of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and general maritime law. These laws make the liability limits established by state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit our affected employees or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages for job-related injuries. Whenever possible, we obtain agreements from customers and suppliers that limit our exposure. However, the occurrence of certain operating hazards, including storms, could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations.\nWe have maintained a policy of insuring our risks of operational hazards that we believe is typical in the industry. We believe that the limits of insurance coverage we have purchased are consistent with the exposures we face and the nature of our products and services. Due to economic conditions in the insurance industry, from time to time, we have increased our self-insured retentions for certain policies in order to minimize the increased costs of coverage, or we have reduced our limits of insurance coverage for, or not procured, named windstorm coverage. In certain areas of our business, we, from time to time, have elected to assume the risk of loss for specific assets. Due to the sale of substantially all of Maritech's oil and gas properties, typical operational risk coverage for its remaining properties, such as removal of debris, operators extra expense, control of well, and pollution and cleanup coverage, is not available at economical rates. To the extent we suffer losses or claims that are not covered, or are only partially covered by insurance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur losses on fixed price contracts.\nDue to competitive market conditions, a portion of our well abandonment and decommissioning projects may be performed on a lump sum basis. Pursuant to these types of contracts, defined work is delivered for a fixed price, and extra work, which is subject to customer approval, is charged separately. The revenue, cost, and gross profit realized on these types of contracts can vary from the estimated amount because of changes in offshore conditions, increases in the scope of the work to be performed, increased site clearance efforts required, labor and equipment availability, cost and productivity levels, and the performance level of other contractors. In addition, unanticipated events, such as accidents, work delays, significant changes in the condition of platforms or wells, downhole problems, weather, and environmental or other technical issues, could result in significant losses on these types of projects. These variations and risks may result in our experiencing reduced profitability or losses on these types of projects.\nThe valuation of decommissioning liabilities is based on estimated data that may be materially incorrect.\nOur estimates of future well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities are imprecise and are subject to change due to: (i) changes in the forecasts of the supply, demand, cost and timing of well abandonment and decommissioning services; (ii) additional remediation work required on previously completed well abandonment projects; (iii) damage to wells and infrastructure caused by hurricanes and other natural events; (iv) changes in governmental regulations governing well abandonment and decommissioning work; and (v) other factors. In particular, a portion of the remaining decommissioning liabilities for our Maritech subsidiary relates to an offshore production platform that was toppled and destroyed by a hurricane and the estimate to perform the remaining decommissioning and debris removal work on this property is particularly imprecise due to the unique nature of the work to be performed. During the three year period ended December 31, 2016, Maritech increased its combined decommissioning liability by a total of approximately $77.6 million, consisting of $38.4 million of revisions to its existing liabilities as well as $39.2 million from adding new liabilities for remediation work required on projects previously thought to have been completed.\nAs noted above, Maritech has encountered situations where previously plugged and abandoned wells on its properties have later exhibited a buildup of pressure that is evidenced by gas bubbles coming from the plugged well head. We refer to this situation as \u201cwells under pressure\u201d, and this can either be discovered by us when we perform additional work at the property or by notification from a third party. Wells under pressure require Maritech to return to the site to perform additional plug and abandonment procedures that were not originally anticipated or included in the estimate of the asset retirement obligation for such property. Remediation work at previously abandoned well sites is particularly costly due to the lack of a platform from which to base these activities. During 2014, Maritech added new decommissioning liabilities of approximately $39.2 million for work performed during the year or related to the estimated cost of future work to be performed on previously plugged and abandoned wells. This additional amount was directly charged to earnings as an operating expense during 2014. Maritech is the last operator of record for its plugged wells and bears the risk of additional future work required as a result of wells becoming under pressure in the future.\nNew federal requirements for financial assurance on offshore oil and gas decommissioning obligations may restrict our borrowing capacity and impose fines and penalties.\nThrough our Maritech subsidiary, we have interests in twelve producing oil and gas leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which may include certain wells, production platforms, pipelines and other facilities located on such leases. As of December 31, 2016, Maritech\u2019s carrying value of its decommissioning liabilities associated with these leases, and remaining wells, platforms, and other facilities (\"Maritech's Interests\") totaled approximately $45.6 million. In July 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Engineering Management (\"BOEM\") issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (\"NTL 2016-N01\") related to such decommissioning liabilities, to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional security may be required to ensure that such liabilities will be satisfied. NTL 2016-N01, which became effective September 12, 2016, provides updated procedures with regard to BOEM's ability to require additional financial security for such liabilities. In connection with NTL 2016-N01, BOEM calculates its own estimate of the decommissioning liabilities associated with all such U.S. Gulf of Mexico leases and other interests, and BOEM has provided to Maritech BOEM's estimate of abandonment liability associated with Maritech's Interests. Maritech is negotiating with BOEM to reduce BOEM's estimate of Maritech's liability to be consistent with Maritech's estimate. The final amount agreed to by BOEM will determine the amount of additional security that Maritech will be required to provide, and could exceed the amount of Maritech's estimate.\nAmong other things, the NTL 2016-N01 eliminates the \u201cwaiver exemption\u201d currently allowed by the BOEM, whereby lessees on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf meeting certain financial strength and reliability criteria are exempted from posting bonds or other acceptable financial assurances for such lessee\u2019s decommissioning obligations. Also, under NTL 2016-N01, Maritech does not qualify to self-insure. NTL 2016-N01 also implements a phase-in period for establishing compliance with additional security obligations for certain properties, whereby lessees may seek compliance with its additional security requirements under a \u201ctailored plan.\u201d A tailored plan would require securing phased-in compliance in three approximately equal installments during a one-year period from the date of the BOEM approval of the tailored plan, which would require us to fund the satisfaction of such estimated decommissioning liabilities within the required time period. Implementation of NTL 2016-N01 could result in Maritech having to obtain additional bonds and/or having to post collateral to obtain such additional bonds, which could reduce the amount of borrowing capacity we have under our Credit Agreement, thus reducing our liquidity. Alternatively, Maritech could be required to provide other financial assurances, including a\nparent company guarantee from us for the benefit of Maritech. We remain hopeful that Maritech's negotiations with the BOEM will result in an acceptable tailored plan that reduces the need for additional financial security. However, if those negotiations do not result in an acceptable tailored plan and if we fail to comply with the current or future orders of BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, or if Maritech fails to proceed with the remaining decommissioning work to avoid the need for any additional security, BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, ordering suspension of operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather-Related Risks\nCertain of our operations are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions.\nThe Offshore Division's Offshore Services segment has historically enjoyed its highest vessel utilization rates during the period from April to October, when weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico are typically more favorable for offshore activities, and has experienced its lowest utilization rates in the period from November to March. Under certain lump sum and other contracts, this segment may bear the risk of delays caused by adverse weather conditions. In addition, demand for other products and services we provide are subject to seasonal fluctuations, due in part to weather conditions that cannot be predicted. Accordingly, our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, depending on weather conditions in applicable areas.\nIn certain markets, the Fluids Division\u2019s onshore water management services can be dependent on adequate water supplies being available to its customers. To the extent severe drought or other weather-related conditions prevent our customers from obtaining needed water, frac water operations may not be possible and our Fluids Division business may be negatively affected.\nSevere weather, including named windstorms, can cause significant damage and disruption to our businesses.\nA significant portion of our operations is susceptible to adverse weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. High winds, storm surge, and turbulent seas can cause significant damage and curtail our operations for extended periods during and after such weather conditions, while damage is being assessed and remediated. Even if we do not experience direct damage from storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations, because we are unable to operate or our customers or suppliers may curtail their activities due to damage to their wells, platforms, pipelines, and facilities. From time to time, our onshore operations are also negatively affected by adverse weather conditions, including sustained rain and flooding.\nA portion of the costs resulting from damages from previous hurricanes has yet to be incurred and may result in significant charges to earnings.\nDuring the past four years, Maritech has performed an extensive amount of well intervention, abandonment, decommissioning, and debris removal associated with its offshore platforms that were destroyed by hurricanes. As of December 31, 2016, Maritech has remaining hurricane damage response work associated with one of the downed platforms, and the estimated cost to perform this remaining abandonment, decommissioning, and debris removal work is approximately $7.9 million net to our interest. Due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed, actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and, depending on the nature of any excess costs incurred, could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods. All of this $7.9 million estimated amount has been accrued as part of Maritech\u2019s decommissioning liabilities. Our estimates of the remaining costs to be incurred may be imprecise.\nFor a further discussion of the remaining costs resulting from damages from the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cNote B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Repair Costs and Insurance Recoveries.\u201d\nWe have elected to self-insure windstorm damage to our remaining Maritech assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and hurricane damages could result in significant uninsured losses.\nDespite the sales of substantially all of Maritech\u2019s oil and gas reserves during 2011 and 2012, and expending approximately $77.7 million of decommissioning work during the three year period ended December 31, 2016, we have remaining decommissioning liabilities of approximately $45.6 million associated with offshore platforms and associated wells to be decommissioned and abandoned. We have discontinued insurance coverage for windstorm damage and have elected to self-insure these risks. To the extent that remaining offshore platforms and associated wells are not decommissioned and abandoned prior to a windstorm occurring, Maritech would be exposed to losses from windstorm damages and storms in the future. Depending on the severity and location of the storms, such losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation, and cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to comply with the financial ratios in our long-term debt agreements could result in defaults under those agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total long-term debt outstanding (excluding CCLP) of $119.6 million consisted of $3.2 million carrying amount under our credit agreement, dated as of June 27, 2006, as subsequently amended, with a syndicate of banks including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, which provides us with a secured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $200 million (subject to certain conditions) (the \"Credit Agreement\") and $116.4 million carrying amount of our 11% Senior Note, which was issued under our Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 1, 2016, as subsequently amended (the \"Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement\"). In addition, as of December 31, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet includes $504.1 million of long-term debt of CCLP, which consisted of (i) $217.5 million carrying amount under CCLP's credit agreement, dated as of August 4, 2014, as subsequently amended, with a syndicate of banks including Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, which provides CCLP with an asset-based revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $315 million, subject to borrowing base requirements (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"), and (ii) $286.6 million carrying amount of CCLP's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2014, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"CCLP Indenture\"). Debt service costs related to outstanding long-term debt represent a significant use of our operating cash flow and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nEach of the Credit Agreement and the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement (collectively the \"Long-Term Debt Agreements\") contains covenants and other restrictions and requirements that, among other things, requires us to maintain certain financial ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Deterioration of these ratios could result in a default under these agreements. Although our Long-Term Debt Agreements include cross-default provisions relating to each other and other indebtedness that we may incur that is greater than a defined amount, there are no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between our Long-Term Debt Agreements and CCLP's Credit Agreement or the CCLP Indenture. If an event of default occurs under either of our Long-Term Debt Agreements and such event is not remedied in a timely manner, an event of default will occur under both of the Long-Term Debt Agreements. Any event of default, if not timely remedied, could result in a termination of all commitments of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, acceleration of all amounts owed thereunder and with regard to the 11% Senior Note, and foreclosure on the collateral securing both of the Long-Term Debt Agreements.\nFollowing the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement in December 2016, the financial ratios in the Credit Agreement include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (which is the ratio of a defined measure of earnings to interest, both measures over the trailing twelve months) of 1.25 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio (which is the ratio of (i) outstanding debt under the Long-Term Debt Agreements and certain other obligations, including letters of credit outstanding, to (ii) a measure of our consolidated net earnings (\"EBITDA\"), all as defined in the Credit Agreement ) of (i) 5.00 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including March 31, 2017 through and including December 31, 2017, (ii) 4.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, (iii) 4.50 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, and (iv) 4.00 to 1 at the end of each of the fiscal quarters thereafter. EBITDA is defined in our Credit Agreement as the aggregate of our net income (or loss) and the net income (or loss) of our consolidated restricted subsidiaries (which excludes CCLP), including cash dividends and distributions (not the return of capital) received\nfrom persons (including CCLP) other than consolidated restricted subsidiaries and after allowances for taxes for such period determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding certain items specifically described therein. This definition of consolidated net earnings excludes an amount of extraordinary and nonrecurring losses up to 25% of a measure of earnings. At December 31, 2016, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.34 to 1 and our leverage ratio was 3.47 to 1.\nUnder the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement, the financial ratio requirements include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (which is identical to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement) of 1.25 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio (which is identical to the maximum leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement) of (i) 5.00 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including March 31, 2017 through and including December 31, 2017, (ii) 4.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, (iii) 4.50 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, and (iv) 4.00 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending thereafter. At December 31, 2016, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.34 to 1 and our leverage ratio was 3.47 to 1.\nOur continuing ability to comply with covenants in our Long-Term Debt Agreements depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flows. Due to the decreased demand for certain of our products and services by our customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, we have reduced long-term debt from the use of equity offering proceeds and taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, benefit reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash to mitigate the reduced demand for our products and services. We believe the steps taken have enhanced our capital structure and operating cash flows and will continue to enhance our operating cash flows in the future. We and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2016. Based on our financial forecasts as of March 1, 2017, which are based on certain operating and other business assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, we anticipate that, despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have sufficient liquidity, earnings and operating cash flows to maintain compliance with all covenants under our Long-Term Debt Agreements through March 1, 2018. However, there can be no assurance that the assumptions we have made will turn out to be accurate or that we will remain in compliance with these covenants going forward, and we could consequently be in default under our Long-Term Debt Agreements if we were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders.\nCCLP's failure to comply with the financial ratios in its long-term debt agreements could result in defaults under those agreements and reduced distributions to us.\nThe CCLP Credit Agreement provides CCLP with an asset-based revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $315 million, subject to borrowing base requirements. As of December 31, 2016, CCLP's balance sheet includes $504.1 million of carrying value of long-term debt of CCLP consisting of (i) $217.5 million under the CCLP Credit Agreement and (ii) $286.6 million of CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes issued pursuant to the CCLP Indenture. Debt service costs related to CCLP's outstanding long-term debt represents a significant use of its operating cash flow and could increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Payment of CCLP's debt service obligations reduces cash available for distribution to its common unitholders, including us. Any breach of, or CCLP's inability to borrow under, the CCLP Credit Agreement, could impact CCLP's ability to fund distributions (if CCLP elected to do so), among other adverse impacts.\nThe CCLP Credit Agreement, as amended in November 2016, contains financial ratio covenants requiring CCLP to maintain (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio (which is a ratio of a defined measure of earnings to interest, both measured over the trailing twelve months) of (A) 2.25 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (B) 2.50 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (C) 2.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including March 31, 2019 and thereafter; (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio (which is a ratio of a defined measure of debt to a defined measure of earnings, both measured over the trailing twelve months) of (A) 5.95 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018, (B) 5.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, and (C) 5.50 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including March 31, 2019 and thereafter; and (iii) a maximum secured leverage ratio (which is a ratio of a defined measure of secured debt to a defined measure of earnings, both measures over the trailing twelve months) of (A) 3.25 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018, and (B) 3.50 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including September 30, 2018 and thereafter. At\nDecember 31, 2016, the CCLP consolidated total leverage ratio was 5.40 to 1 (compared to 5.95 to 1 maximum allowed under the CCLP Credit Agreement), its consolidated secured leverage ratio was 2.35 to 1 (compared to a 3.25 to 1 maximum ratio allowed under the CCLP Credit Agreement), and its interest coverage ratio was 3.13 to 1 (compared to a 2.25 to 1 minimum ratio required under the CCLP Credit Agreement).\nContinued access to the CCLP Credit Agreement is dependent upon CCLP's compliance with the financial ratio covenants as well as the borrowing base and other provisions set forth in the CCLP Credit Agreement. The CCLP Credit Agreement contains additional restrictive provisions (\"cash dominion provisions\") that are imposed if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or \"excess availability\" falls below $30.0 million. The CCLP Credit Agreement provides that CCLP may make distributions to holders of its common units, but only if there is no default under the CCLP Credit Agreement and CCLP maintains excess availability of $30.0 million. CCLP's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the CCLP Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, CCLP's ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the provisions of the CCLP Credit Agreement could result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders under the CCLP Credit Agreement would have all remedies available to secured lenders and could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, institute foreclosure proceedings against CCLP or its subsidiaries\u2019 assets, and force CCLP and its subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of CCLP's debt is accelerated, its assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of CCLP common units, including us, could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. An event of default by CCLP under the CCLP Credit Agreement may constitute an event of default under the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes.\nCCLP is in compliance with all covenants of the CCLP Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016. As a result of the recent decreased demand for certain of CCLP's products and services by CCLP's customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, and CCLP's expectation that the reduced demand will continue for an indefinite period, CCLP has reduced long-term debt from the use of the CCLP Preferred Units offering proceeds and taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash. Based on CCLP's financial forecasts as of February 28, 2017, which are based on certain operating and other business assumptions that CCLP believes to be reasonable, CCLP anticipates that, despite the current industry environment and activity levels, it will have sufficient earnings and operating cash flows to maintain compliance with all covenants under the CCLP Credit Agreement through February 27, 2018. CCLP's plans and forecasts for 2017 include expectations that we will settle certain Omnibus Agreement expenses owed to us by CCLP using CCLP common units in lieu of cash. There can be no assurance that the assumptions CCLP made will turn out to be accurate or that CCLP will remain in compliance with these covenants going forward, and could consequently be in default under the CCLP Credit Agreement if it were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from its lenders. Any such default under the CCLP Credit Agreement may constitute an event of default under the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes. As a result, our cash flows could be further affected.\nWe have continuing exposure to abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with oil and gas properties previously owned by Maritech.\nDuring 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech\u2019s oil and gas producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning liabilities, having an estimated value at the time of sale of approximately $122.0 million pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. For oil and gas properties Maritech previously operated, the buyer of the properties assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, including abandonment and decommissioning, and generally became the successor operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers, who also assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, and these buyers also typically became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning work required, a previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform the abandonment and decommissioning obligation. A significant portion of the decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in 2011 remains unperformed, and we believe the amounts of these remaining liabilities are significant. We monitor the financial condition of the buyers of these properties from Maritech, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue or deteriorate further, we expect that one or more of these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work required on properties they acquired from Maritech. To the extent Maritech is required to perform a significant\nportion of the abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with these previously owned oil and gas properties, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, continued low oil and natural gas prices have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for all oil and gas producing companies, including those companies that bought Maritech properties in the past. Certain of these oil and gas producing companies that bought Maritech properties are currently experiencing severe financial difficulties. With regard to certain of these properties, Maritech has security in the form of bonds or cash escrows that are intended to secure the buyers' obligations to perform the decommissioning work. One company that bought, and subsequently sold, Maritech properties filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Maritech estimates that of the total amount of decommissioning liabilities associated with properties sold to this company, Maritech is exposed to a high level of risk on properties that had decommissioning liabilities at the time they were sold in 2011 of approximately $6 million. Some of these liabilities are currently part of the bankruptcy liquidation plan being administered for this company. This amount, which is net to Maritech's interest, may not be representative of the current fair value of these obligations and does not reflect the potential benefit of bonding that may be available to Maritech if it were to be required to perform such obligations. Maritech and its legal counsel monitor the status of these companies. There can be no assurance that Maritech will not become legally responsible to perform decommissioning work on properties it previously sold, resulting in charges to our future earnings and increases to our future operating cash requirements.\nWe are exposed to significant credit risks.\nWe face credit risk associated with the significant amounts of accounts receivable we have with our customers in the energy industry. Many of our customers, particularly those associated with our onshore operations, are small- to medium-sized oil and gas operators that may be more susceptible to declines in oil and gas commodity prices or generally increased operating expenses than larger companies. Our ability to collect from our customers is impacted by the current decreased oil and natural gas price environment.\nAs a former or present owner and operator of its oil and gas property interests, Maritech has certain liabilities for the proper abandonment and decommissioning of these properties. We have guaranteed a portion of the abandonment and decommissioning liabilities of Maritech. With respect to certain properties, Maritech is entitled to be paid by the previous owner of the property in the future for all or a portion of the cost of satisfying these obligations when the liability is satisfied. We and Maritech are subject to the risk that the previous owner(s) will be unable to make these future payments. In addition, for certain remaining Maritech properties that have not been decommissioned or abandoned, the co-owners of such properties are responsible for the payment of their portions of the associated operating expenses and abandonment liabilities. However, if one or more co-owners do not pay their portions, Maritech and any other nondefaulting co-owners may be liable for the defaulted amount. If any required payment is not made by a previous owner or a co-owner and any security is not sufficient to cover the required payment, we could suffer losses, which could be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, continued decreased oil and natural gas prices have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for oil and gas producing companies, including companies that are joint-owners in Maritech oil and gas properties and decommissioning obligations currently owned or from whom Maritech is entitled to receive payments upon satisfaction of certain decommissioning obligations. Certain of these previous owners of Maritech properties who are obligated to pay Maritech in the future are currently experiencing severe financial difficulties and have filed for bankruptcy protection. During 2016, Maritech charged to earnings $2.8 million of such contractual payment receivables no longer considered realizable. The majority of the remaining amounts owed to Maritech by these companies are not contractually required to be paid to Maritech until the future. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the financial condition of these companies, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue or worsen, certain of these companies may be unable to pay Maritech for contractual amounts owed. Maritech intends to take any action necessary to protect Maritech's interests. Although certain of these decommissioning obligations may not be performed for many years, there can be no assurance that the current oil and gas price environment will not result in additional charges to our future earnings and increases to our future operating cash requirements.\nOur operating results and cash flows for certain of our subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency risk.\nThe operations of certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, the Mexican peso, and the Argentinian peso. Our plans to grow our international operations could cause this exposure from fluctuating currencies to increase. Historically,\nexchange rates of foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar, and this exchange rate volatility is expected to continue. Significant fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Units of CCLP issued on August 2016 and September 2016 (the \"CCLP Preferred Units\") are senior in right of distributions, liquidation and voting to the common units of CCLP, and will result in the issuance of additional CCLP common units in the future, resulting in dilution of our existing common unit ownership in CCLP, and such dilution is potentially unlimited.\nCCLP's partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional common units that CCLP may issue at any time without the approval of its common unitholders. In addition, subject to the provisions of the CCLP partnership agreement and the CCLP Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreements, as herein defined, CCLP may issue an unlimited number of partnership units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation, or voting. On August 8, 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 4,374,454 of CCLP Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per CCLP Preferred Unit (the \u201cIssue Price\u201d), resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $49.8 million. We purchased 874,891 of the CCLP Preferred Units at the Issue Price, for a purchase price of $10.0 million. Additionally, on September 20, 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 2,624,672 of Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per Preferred Unit, resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $29.0 million.\nPursuant to the initial CCLP Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, our wholly owned CSI Compressco GP Inc subsidiary (the general partner of CCLP), executed the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the \u201cAmended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the CCLP Preferred Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that ranks senior to CCLP's common units with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a \u201cCCLP Preferred Unitholder\u201d) will receive quarterly distributions in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments relating to any future issuances of common units below a set price, and any quarterly distributions on our common units in excess of $0.3775 per common unit. In the event CCLP fails to pay in full any quarterly distribution in additional Preferred Units, then until such failure is cured, CCLP is prohibited from making any distributions on its common units. Beginning March 8, 2017 and on the first trading day of each calendar month thereafter for a total of thirty months (each, a \u201cConversion Date\u201d), the CCLP Preferred Units will convert into common units in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP Preferred Unitholder, the number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining. CCLP may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement.\nBecause we own 42.4% of the outstanding CCLP common units, 12.5% of the newly issued CCLP Preferred Units, and approximately 2% general partner interest in CCLP, as a result of the conversion of the CCLP Preferred Units into CCLP common units:\n\u2022\nour previously existing ownership interest in the common units of CCLP will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution on each CCLP common unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe voting power attributable to our previously existing CCLP common units will be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of CCLP common units may decline.\nWe and CCLP are exposed to interest rate risks with regard to our respective credit facility indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we and CCLP have a total of $220.7 million outstanding under our respective revolving credit facilities. These revolving credit facilities consist of floating rate loans that bear interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread (which is determined on our leverage ratio) above LIBOR. Accordingly, our cash flows and results of operations could be subject to interest rate risk exposure associated with the level of the variable rate debt balance outstanding. We currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk.\nOur revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2019. CCLP's revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on August 4, 2019. Our 11% Senior Note, which matures November 2022, and CCLP's\n7.25% Senior Notes, which mature August 2022, bear interest at fixed interest rates. There can be no assurance that the financial market conditions or borrowing terms at the times these existing debt agreements are renegotiated will be as favorable as the current terms and interest rates.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Political Risks\nOur operations are subject to extensive and evolving U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements that increase our operating costs and expose us to potential fines, penalties, and litigation.\nLaws and regulations govern our operations, including those relating to corporate governance, employees, taxation, fees, importation and exportation restrictions, environmental affairs, health and safety, and the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, use, and sale of chemical products. Certain foreign countries impose additional restrictions on our activities, such as currency restrictions and restrictions on various labor practices. Our operation and decommissioning of offshore properties are subject to and affected by various government regulations, including numerous federal and state environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent, and compliance is becoming increasingly expensive. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, and injunctions. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with certain laws and regulations. It is possible that increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.\nThe EPA is studying the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, a process used by the U.S. oil and gas industry in the development of certain oil and gas reservoirs. Specifically, the EPA is reviewing the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states have adopted regulations that require operators to disclose the chemical constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. We cannot predict whether any federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted regarding hydraulic fracturing, and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on oil and gas operators through the adoption of new laws and regulations, the domestic demand for certain of our products and services could be decreased or subject to delays, particularly for our Production Testing, Compression, and Fluids Divisions.\nA large portion of the services performed by our Offshore Division's Offshore Services segment and all of Maritech\u2019s remaining well abandonment and decommissioning operations are conducted on offshore federal leases and are governed by increasing U.S. government regulations. Government regulations also establish construction requirements for production facilities located on federal offshore leases and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities from these leases. Operators must abide by Idle Iron Guidance regulations that regulate the permanent plugging of nonproducing wells and the dismantling of oil and gas production platforms within a certain period of time after they are no longer being used. BSEE oversees the provisions of the Idle Iron Guidance. Under limited circumstances, the BSEE could require Maritech or our Offshore Services segment to suspend or terminate their operations on a federal lease, and both Maritech and our Offshore Services segment could be subject to fines and penalties.\nWe have significant operations that are either ongoing or scheduled to commence in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At this time, we cannot predict the full impact that other regulatory actions that may be mandated by the federal government may have on our operations or the operations of our customers. Other governmental or regulatory actions could further reduce our revenues and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOur onshore and offshore operations expose us to risks such as the potential for harmful substances escaping into the environment and causing damages or injuries, which could be substantial. Although we maintain general liability and pollution liability insurance, these policies are subject to exceptions and coverage limits. We maintain limited environmental liability insurance covering named locations and environmental risks associated with contract services for oil and gas operations. We could be materially and adversely affected by an enforcement proceeding or a claim that is not covered or is only partially covered by insurance.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements that impose additional restrictions on the industry may\nadversely affect our financial results. Regulators are becoming more focused on air emissions from oil and gas operations, including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases. In particular, the focus on greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our financial results if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs, capital spending requirements, or additional operating restrictions for us, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn addition to increasing our risk of environmental liability, the rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has accelerated the growth of some of the markets we serve. Decreased regulation and enforcement in the future could materially and adversely affect the demand for certain of the services offered by our Offshore Services operations and, therefore, materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur expansion into foreign countries exposes us to complex regulations and may present us with new obstacles to growth.\nWe plan to continue to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in, among other countries, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Ghana, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Foreign operations carry special risks. Our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating cash back to the United States;\n\u2022\nthe impact of compliance with anti-corruption laws on our operations and competitive position in affected countries and the risk that actions taken by us or our agents may violate those laws;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls and government actions, such as expropriation of assets and changes in legal and regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes; and\n\u2022\nour limited knowledge of these markets or our inability to protect our interests.\nWe and our affiliates operate in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist. While we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner, there is a risk of violating either the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K Bribery Act, or laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions or other applicable anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nForeign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the U.S. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot obtain them in a timely manner, our growth and profitability from foreign operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations in Argentina expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environments in that country, including the changing regulations over repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina.\nThe current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and recent devaluation of the Argentinian peso have created increased economic instability for foreign investment in Argentina. The Argentinian government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing devaluations pressure. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina has led to devaluations of the Argentinian peso, particularly in late 2013, early 2014, and late 2015. Additional currency adjustment may be necessary to help boost the current Argentina economy, but may be accompanied by fiscal and monetary tightening, including additional restrictions on the purchase of U.S. dollars in Argentina.\nAs a result of our operations in Argentina, consolidated revenues and operating cash flow generated in Argentina have increased over the past three years. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $3.2 million of our\nconsolidated cash balance is located in Argentina, and the process of repatriating this cash to the U.S. is subject to increasingly complex regulations. There can be no assurances that our growing Argentinian operations will not expose us to a loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses, and other potential financial impacts.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe EPA has determined that \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\"GHGs\") present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"). Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA rules regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and from certain large stationary sources as well as requiring so-called \u201cgreen\u201d completions at hydraulically fractured natural gas wells beginning in 2015. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, as well as from certain oil and gas production facilities.\nThe adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our facilities and operations could require us to incur costs. Further, Congress has considered and almost one-half of the states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and, in turn, demand for our products and services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nOur proprietary rights may be violated or compromised, which could damage our operations.\nWe own numerous patents, patent applications, and unpatented trade secret technologies in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of these rights. In addition, independent third parties may develop competitive or superior technologies.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, customer invoicing, employee information, and other business processes. We outsource certain business process functions to third-party providers and similarly rely on these third-parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control, including those involving cyberattacks using viruses, worms or other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such breaches have in the past and could again in the future result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date.\nHowever, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response.", "PERMNO": 76127, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "TTI"}
