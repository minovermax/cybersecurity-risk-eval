{"cik": "1699018", "company": "Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business strategy includes significant growth of our assets and liabilities, including increasing and diversifying our lending operations, which will increase our fixed expenses. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur strategic plan contemplates significant growth in assets and liabilities over the next several years. Specifically, we intend to increase our commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, construction loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, while attracting favorably priced deposits to fund our increased lending. In addition, we intend to significantly grow our mortgage banking operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional expenses due to the implementation of our strategic plan, including salaries and occupancy expense related to new lending officers and related support staff. Many of these increased expenses are considered fixed expenses. Unless we can successfully implement our strategic plan, our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected by increased costs.\nThe successful implementation of our strategic plan will require, among other things, that we increase our market share by attracting both new borrowers and new deposit customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. In addition, our ability to successfully grow will depend on several factors, including continued favorable market conditions, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area, and our ability to maintain high asset quality as we increase our commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, construction loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, growth opportunities may not be available and we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy. Further, our new strategic plan, even if successfully implemented, may not ultimately produce positive results.\nA continued increase in interest rates or a change in market conditions could reduce our mortgage banking revenues, which would negatively impact our non-interest income.\nWe sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, which provides a significant portion of our non-interest income. We generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of mortgage loans to investors on a servicing-released basis. This was down to $1.5 million from $1.9 million in 2017. We also earn interest on loans held for sale while they are awaiting delivery to our investors. For the year ended December 31, 2018, income from loan sales equaled $1.5 million, which made up approximately 86.4% of our non-interest income and 22.1% of our revenue. We intend to increase our mortgage banking operations, including adding up to six additional commission-based mortgage lenders. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may continue to decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expenses associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nIf there are higher than expected losses on loans that we have previously sold, or if we are forced to repurchase such loans, it would negatively affect our earnings.\nOne of our primary business operations is our mortgage banking, which involves originating residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market, primarily to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the Mortgage Purchase Program (\u201cMPP\u201d). Under the terms of the MPP, we are required to maintain a Lender Risk Account (\u201cLRA\u201d). The LRA consists of amounts withheld from the loan sale proceeds by the FHLB-Cincinnati for absorbing inherent losses that are probable on the loans we sell. These withheld funds are an asset to the Company as they are scheduled to be paid to the Company in future years, net of any credit losses on the loans sold. If there are higher than estimated losses on the loans we have sold to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP, the amount of the LRA would be reduced through a charge to earnings, which would reduce our earnings and capital.\nIn addition, our loans sold in the secondary market have agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we have sold in cases of borrower default or breaches of these representations and warranties. If we are required to repurchase mortgage loans or provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our costs and thereby affect our future earnings.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2018, $73.6 million, or 59.4%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by one- to four-family real estate. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in current residential real estate values could reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. As a result, we have increased risk that we could incur losses if borrowers default on their loans because we may be unable to recover all or part of the defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. In addition, if borrowers sell their homes, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses on our residential mortgage loans.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate in our market area, which makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in the local economy and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a community banking franchise located in Cincinnati, Ohio. At December 31, 2018, a substantial amount of our mortgage loans were secured by real estate located in Hamilton County, Ohio and, to a lesser extent, the adjoining counties in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. As a result, we have a greater risk of loan defaults and losses in the event of economic weakness in this area, which may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to timely repay their loans. A deterioration in economic conditions in the market area we serve could result in, among other things: (i) an increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures; (ii) a decrease in the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers; and (iii) a decline in the value of the collateral securing our loans. Consequently, a deterioration in economic conditions in the local economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans is comprised of non-owner occupied properties which increases the credit risk on this portion of our loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2018, of the $73.6 million of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in our portfolio, $6.5 million, or 8.8% of this amount, was comprised of non-owner occupied properties. We do not make such loans anymore. Our non-owner occupied residential loans are secured primarily by single family properties, and to a much lesser extent, by two- to four-unit properties. We believe that there is a greater credit risk inherent in investor-owner and non-owner occupied properties than in owner occupied single family properties since, similar to commercial real estate and multi-family loans, the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower\u2019s ability to lease the units of the property. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us, which may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to residential and commercial borrowers with only one loan. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing these loans or the revenues derived from these properties which could affect the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. At December 31, 2018, none of our non-owner occupied one- to four-family loans were delinquent 30 days or more.\nCommercial real estate and land loans and commercial business loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate, and these risks will increase if we succeed in our plan to increase this type of lending.\nGiven the larger balances and/or the higher complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and land loans and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. Commercial real estate and land loans and commercial business loans have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans because repayment is generally dependent on income generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. If the associated business deteriorates or does not generate sufficient business for the borrower to make required payments, we may not collect the outstanding loan amount owed to us.\nA key component of our strategy is to increase our origination of commercial business loans and commercial real estate and land loans to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our returns or yields on our loan portfolio. This increase will significantly increase our exposure to the risks inherent in these types of loans.\nWe intend to grow our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit, which will increase our credit risk.\nAs part of our strategic business plan, we intend to increase our home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $13.8 million, or 11.1%, of our total loans. Most of our home equity loans and lines of credit are secured by real estate in Hamilton County, Ohio and contiguous counties. We generally originate home equity lines of credit with loan-to-value ratios of up to 90% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Declines in real estate values in our market area could cause some of our home equity loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss in the event that we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nWe make construction loans which are considered to have greater credit risk than other types of residential loans made by financial institutions.\nWe originate construction loans for one- to four-family residential properties and, to a lesser extent, commercial properties. We intend to increase the amount of such loans that we originate. While we believe we have established adequate allowances in our financial statements to cover the credit risk of our construction loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our allowances, which could adversely impact our future earnings.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nLending is inherently risky and we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower\u2019s default on a loan may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management\u2019s time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to charge-off the loan in whole or in part. In such situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nAt December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.96%. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current\neconomic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance and thereby decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may reduce our net income and our capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in market interest rates may reduce our profits.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIf interest rates rise, and if rates on our deposits reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, we would experience compression of our interest rate spread, which would have a negative effect on our net interest income and profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which would also negatively impact our interest income.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2018, our \u201crate shock\u201d analysis indicates that our net portfolio value would decrease by $5.9 million, or 14.7%, if there were an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in market interest rates. However, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results.\nIf our non-performing assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2018, our non-performing assets, which consist of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were $957,000, or 0.7% of total assets. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u2022\nwe record interest income only on the cash basis or cost-recovery method for non-accrual loans and we do not record interest income for other real estate owned;\n\u2022\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u2022\nnon-interest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values;\n\u2022\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity.\nIn addition, the funds that are invested in non-performing assets cannot be reinvested in other assets until the non-performing assets are resolved. If additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non-performing assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur small size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur small asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions which are generally larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because one of our primary sources of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments, less the interest we pay on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base makes it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the ongoing increased costs of compliance with banking and other regulations.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If competition causes us to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued industry consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can as well as better pricing for those products and services.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nEagle Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the ODFI and the FDIC, and Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. will be subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the bank, rather than for stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of\nregulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, many of which are not in final form. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and has diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, compile, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our operating costs or cause losses.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nPhysical, procedural and technological safeguards designed to protect confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of information will not occur, and if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, that those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party\u2019s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition,\nany compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource the majority of our data processing to third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our senior management to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations. We have recently added to our management team and could be harmed by the failure to successfully integrate the new members of our management team or by the loss of any of our senior management.\nWe depend upon the services of the members of our senior management team to implement our business strategy and execute our operations. Our management team is comprised of experienced executives, with our top four executives possessing an average of 25 years of financial institution experience. Members of our senior management team and lending personnel who have expertise and key business relationships in our markets could be difficult to replace. In addition, some of the members of our senior management team have been recently added. The loss of members of our management team, the failure to successfully integrate the new members of our management team, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete.\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses.\nAs a result of the completion of our offering, we will become a public reporting company. We expect that the obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the SEC. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted a final rule implementing the regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel III\u201d) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios.\nThe new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also requires unrealized\ngains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Eagle Savings Bank has elected to opt out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, when fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and has increased each year reaching full implementation in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements likely will result in lower returns on equity, and could require raising additional capital in the future, or result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, change our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. The implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing our shares.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable assets of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank for fiscal year 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that\nare probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties, regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our loan foreclosure policy, which requires us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf our real estate owned is not properly valued our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned and at certain other times during the holding period of the asset. Our net book value (\u201cNBV\u201d) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated fair value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset\u2019s NBV over its fair value less estimated selling costs. If our valuation process is incorrect, or if property values decline, the fair value of our real estate owned may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. Significant charge-offs to our real estate owned could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our real estate owned and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, growth and prospects.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We rely on customer deposits and advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati and other borrowings to fund our operations. At December 31, 2018, we had no FHLB-Cincinnati advances outstanding with an additional $54.4 million of available borrowing capacity. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and\nadvances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB-Cincinnati, or market conditions change. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets where our loans are concentrated, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets.\nOur financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Although we consider our sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on reasonable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable, or are not available on reasonable terms, our financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects could be materially adversely affected. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nThe trading market in our common stock is limited, which could hinder your ability to sell our common stock. In addition, if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, your ability to sell our common stock could become more restricted.\nThe development of an active trading market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control, or that of any market maker. The number of active buyers and sellers of the shares of our common stock at any particular time may be limited. Under such circumstances, you could have difficulty selling your shares of common stock on short notice, and, therefore, you should not view the shares of common stock as a short-term investment. In addition, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market in the future, voluntarily or involuntarily, which could further decrease market liquidity and your ability to sell your shares.", "PERMNO": 16821, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "EFBI"}
